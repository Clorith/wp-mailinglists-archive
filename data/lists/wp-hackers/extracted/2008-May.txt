Wait, so there's a button there already? Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not 
using the TinyMCE editor to the fullest, I'm just using the plain Jane 
one.. Either way, just slap a "nextpage" button there on the plain Jane 
one by the "more" button.. I'd be happy. =D

Hello

One of my colleagues has been testing giving users edit posts permissions
for an 'open' Wordpress blog and has just discovered an interesting issue
that we can't quite fathom out the logic behind.

Currently, if you have the 'edit_post' capability, you are able to spam
and delete comments, but not approve them. There's a 'modeate_comments'
capability that already exists, which to me, would make sense for spam'ing
and deleting comments as well as approving them.

Would it be worth changing the capability that's used for it, or even
creating  another capability?

I suspect we might be able to actually provide the patch to the code for
this, if it is worth doing...

perhaps because mysql won't give you transactions by default? this could 
be, of course, solved by making the tables InnoDB when initially 
installing, provided the host has it configured (the read performance - 
which is what matters for a blog/CMS - should be about the same for 
InnoDB and MyISAM, but I have yet to see a comparison between the two 
using Wordpress).

This is something I would love to see in the core. Right now I do 
patches for a few different sites to make moderate_comments a separate 
capability from edit_posts. That way they can have actual comment 
moderators take care of the discussions, which is a must on sites that 
get an average of 2,000 comments a day.

I would say if this makes it into core, check for either the edit_post 
or moderate_comments capability. That should help with backwards 
compatibility. If this seems like something the powers to be want in the 
core, I already have a patch for it, which I use for the sites I take 
care of.

Having 'edit_post' people being able to moderate comments doesn't really
help in our particular case, I have to say.

Could you possibly email me your patch?

I just sent it to you. In the past I have tried to get around patching 
the core by doing a plugin on the capabilities filters. I never could 
get it to work. The problem is that you don't know the actual scope that 
edit_post is being checked for. Even trying to go off of the current 
page being viewed, it ends up enabling things like manage posts in the 
menu and other features you don't want, so the patch is the only way I 
know to get around it (short of totally removing WP comment moderation 
stuff and placing it in a plugin).

Since the upgrade to 2.5.1, there are comments in my moderation queue. I 
get e-mails about them, and can individual approve them or spam them or 
whatever. The comments appear on the individual pages. However they do 
not show up in the list at

http://www.elharo.com/blog/wp-admin/edit-comments.php?comment_status=moderated

If I show all comments, I still get No results found.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Does anyone know why comment smight 
appear everywhere except the admin interface? This picture shows the 
problem:

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP doesn't notify when comment is approved
Message-ID: <4819D5BE.3000706@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I couldn't figure out why I didn't get an email once I approved a 
comment since upgrading to 2.5.1. So, I dug into the code, and found out 
that this is missing since 2.5, or more specifically since the 
moderation.php functionality was moved to edit-comments.php.

The relevant code in moderation.php was:
if ( get_option( 'comments_notify' ) == true ) {
    wp_notify_postauthor( $k );
}

This appears to be completely missing in edit-comments.php. Bug report, 
patch, etc attached to:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6892

Cheers - Callum.

You might want to switch mail to use SMTP instead of PHP's mail() 
function. <blatant plug>My WP Mail SMTP[1] plugin (updated today) will

Can anyone confirm if this is true? Any suggestions on how to fix?

Ahh. Didn't know that. Did some research and yeah, transactions are
not supported properly on MyISAM tables, which kinda blows IMO.

Of course, the next upgrade could also have "ALTER TABLE whatever
ENGINE = InnoDB" in it...

InnoDB needs to be left up to the user. MySQL doesn't configure InnoDB 
by default, so chances are it will break for a bunch of people. As far 
as using InnoDB - it rocks on a table that gets updated a lot. On a 
couple of our sites that see an average of 2,000 comments a day, 
changing wp_comments and wp_posts to InnoDB was a life saver.

When a post transitions from future to publish, wp_publish_post() is
called.  It updates the counts for all of the post's terms.  At least,
that is what is supposed to happen. I haven't tested yet.

Hi,

in the past, when I approved a comment I used to still get an email

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding JS to a Page based upon the used shortcodes
Message-ID: <663be1170805020413i406373d0q81bcc9ccdc2ceae7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working on an image gallerie plugin using the new shortcodes and I want
to add some options to define
a) how the gallerie should look
b) which JS is used (thickbox, lytebox, jQuery Lightbox, and some others,
which will do really different things like slideshows, flash like galleries,
carousels and stuff)

While I could make this be defined consistantly between all pages when using
options, I want to make it costomizable per Post (or per Gallerie I should
say, since one could use more then one gallerie and one could use a gallerie
in template) using attributes in the shortcodes.

I know about the wp_enqueue_script command but this doesn't work when called
inside the shortcode function since this is much to late (head is out
allready) - and I do not know about any functionality how to know about the
used shortcodes before I am in the shortcode function. Is there any way to
do this?

Yes maybe it would work to write the JS directly into the body but this
isn't a good solution. Any ideas?

Thanks
Alex

I haven't checked this in 2.5, but I believe you could hook into  
template_redirect. The posts have been queried, but nothing has been  
output to the browser at that point. You could sniff the content and  
add wp_enqueue_script hooks then.

Yes, you could wait as long as the wp_print_scripts action before
enqueuing your script, but that's it. You'll have to manually search
the post content for the shortcodes.

Thanks Casey and Otto,
that seems to do the trick at least for "standard templates" with only a
single loop.

the only remaining thing is:
I will also need to know which methods are used inside the template - but
there I may aks the user to specify which scripts should be enqueued on each
page load because they are used in template... (I think this is still better
then scanning all template files which would be an enormous performance
waste).

Maybe I will add a fallback to add the script in body when it wasn't added
to head allready since this is still better than if it's missing.

I haven't figured the WP Super Cache part yet in my config, but this is
what I'm using for now.

  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name blog.example.com;
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/example.com.access.log;
    client_max_body_size 16m;

  }

Adding WP Super Cache should just require two more tests for a file
existing.  The non-compressed case is easier, but I don't know off-hand
how to check the request headers for gzip acceptance.

Just to clarify, we're only running it on gravatar.com and the
wordpress.com load balancers at the moment.  It is not running on the
wordpress.com web servers.

That is what I guessed.
Does that mean LiteSpeed is still being used for the web servers?

Could try using get_footer() (not wp_footer() that's missing from a lot 
of themes), as all of the js effects scripts run "on dom loaded" and can 
be included just above the </body> tag. Then you could check for all 
scripts included in the header and all calls coming from templates and 
shortcodes.

Hi,

I have a client who has to do scheduled posting and admits he cannot
understand international time.
I find it strange that the posting time in WP is automatically set to
International when most Americans do not get it unless they have been in the
military.

Is there a way to revert this to AM PM format?

Yay, for difficult clients.

I think your best bet would be to use jquery to hide the normal hour
box and add a new textbox and an am/pm checkbox both with onchange and
onselect actions (better yet, maybe the whole slew of them). Then when
he edits the checkbox or the fake hour box, update the hidden one.

Creative solution :)
Seriously so many people cannot figure out international time (although my 7
year old daughter cracked that one not too long ago) so I am surprised there
is no way to change it.
Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding a new rss feed to WordPress, how?
Message-ID: <20080503013716.a3d4ea73@mail.lttd.net>

Hi All,

I'm adding RSS support to my plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bluetrait-event-viewer/).

My  plugin is an event viewer (it tracks failed logins etc). The RSS feed  will allow users to monitor wordpress failed logins without needing to  go to the site.

What is the best way to add an RSS feed to  WordPress? I currently have a function that outputs the RSS but I'd  like to be able to hook into wordpress so that I don't need to add  another external file.

Does WordPress allow for custom content? I've done a quick search but cannot find anything.

Thanks,
Michael Dale.

I would set the query variable "feed" to something particular to your
plugin, e.g. set_query_var('feed, 'whatever'), whenever you want to
output your custom feed.  Add a callback function to an action hook
that is named 'do_feed_' + your feed variable value, like so:

function load_feed_whatever() {
        load_template( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/feed-rss2.php' );
}
add_action('do_feed_whatever', 'load_feed_whatever');

That will use wp-includes/feed-rss2.php as your template.

You may want to check out Alex King's 404 Notifier plugin.[1] That
plugin outputs a feed without any extra files.

It took me 3 minutes to understand this. You mean... there are people
who don't understand 16:00????

And I would say it shouldn't be hard for users in the USA to learn that pm
is nothing else than adding 12 to the hour - it's not that you have to be
genoius to understand what is meant and it is not hard to calculate in any
way...

Tell him that for 3 pm post he need to add 12 to got the international
time, add 0 for AM hours... that's not hard if he can type he can do a
simple sum :)

Know what? This seems obviously the best way to do it. This would be even
better than scanning the codes since it wouldn't require additional
computing time, just an array to be filled. Thanks!

Hi,

So from your answers I am seeing that there is no wp-friendly way to change
that clock to allow for imperial AM/PM time selection (when scheduling
posts.)

Thanks for your answers,

Marie-Lynn

Is there any industry or WordPress preferred method for version number
increments?
I've never released code to the public before that had the potential of
future revisions. What determines if a script goes from 1.0 to 1.1 or 1.1.1
or 2.0? Also, what determines if the initial script is released < 1.0?

If there is no "standard", why do you do it like you do?

Thanks,
Glenn Ansley

Essentially, that is correct.

And US users should understand that format just fine.. It's military
time. Pretty obvious, really.

Never heard it called "international time" before.

Usually if a script has a version less than 1.0, it is assumed that it
is still "beta" and may go boom.

Other than that it is up to you. Usually going from 1.0 -> 2.0 signals
a large change, 1.0 -> 1.5 signals a medium change, 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1 is
usually something fairly small. It is very arbitrary and usually is
used however the dev wants to use it, but be consistent within your
own project. Don't go from 1.0 to 1.1 to 1.2.3 to 1.7 to 3.14.

Right now for one of my larger projects I'm using 1.(major revision
number).(minor revision). The major revisions are consecutive odd
numbers and the minor are consecutive counting numbers.

Not to some people, but most can get it very quickly if you point out
the difference. It can be hard teaching it to some students so they
can use it in equations.

Personally, my watch is always set on military time, AM/PM has always
seemed overly arbitrary to me.

So you would go from 1.1 to 1.3 and skip 1.2?

I'm not sure if there is an industry standard, but this is the way I do it:

If I am fixing typos, small bugs, or correcting an error that happens in a
small number of configurations, I iterate the third number.

If I am adding features but not breaking the way any current functionality
works, I iterate the second number.

If I'm adding more than 2 features and backward compatibility might be
broken, I iterate the first number.

A script is released < 1.0 if the author considers it "beta" and not
completely finished.

Best,
Nick Ohrn

The AM/PM has a sense if you think to clock that have 12 hours and not
24, but whole europe, and i suppose most of asia etc use 24hours base
with no problem.. here in italy we know that is dark and it's 3.. it's
3 am, except for eclypses.. :)

That's how I do it as well. No even or odd stuff.

First = complete recode edition or at least huge changes
Second = new features or whatnot, but not crazy big code wise
Third = bugfixes

Exactly. Sure, it's a bit odd at first, but I don't know of too many people
who haven't heard of a 24 hour clock before. They may never use them, but it
doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out a 24 hour clock.

With that said, I wouldn't mind an option in the profile to pick between 12
and 24 hour inputs.

Someone write a patch! :)

Yep - prefer 24 hr clock myself in admin but choice would be good!

Only if the default value is for 24h format... this time being not
UScentric it's better :)

BTW 24 hour time is used everywhere outside of the US including here
in Canada. It is likely that the percentage of WordPress users is higher in
the US than anywhere else and that is why I am surprised to not have
found discussions about this before.

It's not that US users don't know about 24 hour time, but many people are
not used to working with it.  Personally, I am fine translating it, but
plenty of other users, like my wife, are not so good with math.  I hate to
think that normal (people who aren't good at math) users would have to pull
out a calculator to figure out what time it's set at.  That's not terribly
usable.  My wife had a hard enough time reading the tube schedules while we
were in London.

Thanks these responses were helpful.
BTW, why did WP skip 2.4?

Because they added so much stuff that everything was broken afterwards ;-)
just kidding but there were many changes and additions - (just think about
the admin interface, the swf uploader, the gallery functionality, the
shortcodes,...) that someone decided this are too many changes for a single
subversion jump while there are not many enogh for a mayer version jump.

Same with me but I add a 4th level for quick security fixes which should be
updated soon - while level 3 is ment for a bundle of bug fixes which is not
so serious but may be anoying.

I should add that this is a thing you do not need to be too serious about,
but it is just better to change the versions in a stepped way then ending up
with Version 250 because every single fix got its own main version number...

It also helps users to know how much trouble might arise because of
incompatabilities. 2.x changes at WordPress did often break up things (2.2
to 2.3 broke every taggin plugin for example) while 2.2.x and 2.3.x changes
didn't break anything at all (up to my knowledge)

Maybe it will sound rude but it's not my intention... You mean that
people not good in math means thay have hard time summing and
subtracting numbers that are not greater than 24? I can't belive it!

So this means that they are not be able to calculate at 5pm what time
will be if someone say them that something will last for 13 hours?

I wonder what happens to them when they have to check  a bank account
doing minimal house account and just calculating the rest when they
buy something in a shop... sorry but i wouldnet define them normal
people.. or you have to call me a genius i can solve equations etc...
and i can program computer!

If WordPress had been built on that concept, it wouldn't be famous for its
five-minute install (OMG! They can't create a wp-config file!?), it's easy
to use editor (Who can't code in HTML, after all?), and wouldn't be the
choice software for the Average Joe searching for a decent blogging engine.

So is this the ultimate dumbing down of education? I thought primary

Ok - I admit that people shouldn't have php coding skills to publish via
WordPress.
I admit they shouldn't even have to know about HTML while this would be a
good thing anyway.
They don't need to rocket scientists or something similar.
But I think they really should know how to add 12 to a number less then 12
without using a calculator! Next time someone will ask WordPress to take
care for illiterate people and take voice as input?

Just for clarification:
I'd really like someone to patch this since internationalization and ease of
use is already a goal of WP. Best would be someone who is familar with that
format - which I am not. I could imagine a selection box behind the minute
field which has 2 options: "24 Format/am" and "pm" with "24 Format/am"
preselected. If the first is choosen everything stays the same - it can be
used for "am" times just like if there was no change and for 24 hour times
too. If pm is selected 12 is added to the hour and thats it.

But you simply can not tell me someone is able to use WordPress and isn't
able to add 12 to 1, 2, 3, ..., 11 without a calculator!

This should probably be a per-user setting so that they don't have to select
it every time they write a post.  Also, it'd be better to handle it in PHP
than JS.  MySQL understands both time formats without problem.

Sure, most people probably can, but it's not as easy for some perfectly
intelligent people as it is for others.  For some, it'd be easier to use a
calculator than to do it in their head.

Yes, I mean exactly this.  And no, this is not because people are dumb.
Some people have talents that do not include doing math quickly in their
head.  They can work it out if they need to, but it's still a usability
problem.

They would use a calculator or work it out on paper.

There's a difference between intelligence and math aptitude.

So you want to tell me you need a setting to say "use pm per default"
because someone is to lazy to select if he means am or pm???

Ok I'll explain my idea a bit slower:
You have a selection list like following (where every line means a
selectable value)

- 24 Format / am
- pm

You do NOT need to seperate 24 and am since it doesn't matter. 3am is the
same then 3 (international) - you will not have to add or substract anything
here!
And when some person is not able to calculate international time he/she will
have to admit that he/she needs to select if he/she means am or pm!
WordPress just can not guess that!

Also, it'd be better to handle it in PHP
> than JS.  MySQL understands both time formats without problem.


Did I ever say this should be handles via JS?
I said add a selection list where you can select it should be PM and then
add 12 to what was submitted. You could as well add pm to the MySQL
statement if mysql can work with that - I don't care which way.

When you go to edit the timestamp of a post, new or existing, it populates
with a time.  If it's in the evening, it's going to be a value higher than
12.  The way you suggest, for people who do not want to use 24 hour time,
they would have to select the PM option and then subtract 12 (unless you do
that automatically with JS).  Either way, it's a usability issue.  And
that's not laziness, it's just the way that a large portion of WordPress'
audience does

No, they skipped it because the release date was going to be during the 
Christmas period, which, combined with the fact Ryan Boren had some sort 
of illness, would have meant that they wouldn't be able to fit 
everything they wanted to in.
Also, they knew that the admin panel redesign couldn't be finished in 
time. They could have delayed the release, but this would have thrown 
the rest of the release timeline out.

Thanks,
Ryan.

Yes. I normally use the even numbers for development versions.

Wow this seems like a totally unhelpful and sour attitude. In my
opinion, what you're describing is horribly unintuitive. Even your
description of your idea is hard to follow. I don't see why this
couldn't just be a user profile option (i.e. 24-hour or 12-hour clock,
which examples).

I hadn't checked this whole conversation out until just now, I don't see 
why everyone is getting the panties into a bunch for... WordPress has 
it's own settings, just set YOURS as to your timezones... plain and 
simple... Regardless of what YOU WANT, regardless of HOW YOU WANT it... 
it's still the same thing... Your host is one place, compared to you as 
well... so in order for YOUR time to show how YOU want it, you'd have to 
set it accordingly.

Google is your friend most of the time.. PM OR AM..

PM / AM... from the sounds of it, everyone getting all PMs... over a 
clock time... reeeeelaaaaaaxxxxxxxxxxxx

We aren't talking about timezone settings.  We're talking about the post
time inputs being in 24 hour format.

Ahhhh! Sorry for jumping the gun then folks. From the LAST message, I 
thought it was about timezones in general. I see what you're talking 
about now... and even I agree with the original discussion then.

Because there are some people (especially Matt Mullenweg) who really dislike
options - thats why I am always trying to leve them out when dealing with
WordPress, while I myselfe would prefere adding some options.

And they would end up with what? with the same hour and no change. If they
want to change it they could perfectly well change the hour (without doing
calculations, just select the hour you want it) and the selections (if am
doesn't apply), if they are OK with the hour and are only changing the
minute they wouldn't have to think about the hour and leave it like it is -
but hey, it's just an idea anyway, trying to avoid options since they are
officially disliked (while I do not know why and if there are possibilities
where they aren't disliked). Of course one could add an option and put out
the time fields accordingly.

In my opinion, what you're describing is horribly unintuitive.

Hmm thinking it over I admit it will be unintuitive for many. Yes the way
with the options would be better. Someone should write that patch and then
we should hope it will be added to core.

Wow this seems like a totally unhelpful and sour attitude.

Sorry, not my intention.

Cool, this got a bit heated for some reason, I'm not sure why, but it
seems ok now. :)

I've written a patch and I'll be creating a ticket shortly after I
clean it up a bit. I took the options route, but it's my first patch
to WP (as well as my first non-trivial hack) so we'll see how it goes.
I'll post the ticket number in here once I've created it.

To me, what would be a lot more friendly would be that, in
Settings/General, instead of picking a UTC Timezone and saving until
the time seems to match (as if you knew what UTC timezone you're
in...), there was a simple JS stuff updating local time each time you
pick a timezone.

I think the issue is not with timezone, but with the time format
displayed by the post/page editor. It currently uses 24-hour time
rather than 12-hour time. This is completely independent of timezone.
The contention here is that some people do not understand a 24-hour
clock and would prefer to see/set post timestamps using a 12-hour
clock representation.

I understood the point of this thread with this (rather worthless imo)
24H vs AM/PM.
My 2 cents are that, while improving things in this area, would be
better that instead of picking a timezone by *naming it* (I for one
don't know if I live in UTC+2 or UTC+1 or whatever) it would be more
friendly to pick a timezone by its *current hour* (I for one know if
it's 9 or 10 where I live, and if I don't, my computer's javascript
does)
Example: http://i25.tinypic.com/2btehi.gif

(This said, I don't really care about this whole stuff. Just a
suggestion on this topic)

Burn! ;-)

Maybe you should add a default for existing users (select 24 Format if
nothing was selected) since empty radio buttons look weird.
Tested it - workes all right for me.

You know what might be cool? If you used the locale to figure out what the
default should be for users that don't have it set.  Like assume that en_US
would want 12 hour time.

Except that most UK users don't bother to upload a GB translation file to
translate WordPress from English to English and so with your code, they'd
get a 12 hour clock. ;)

Anyway, I'm not sure how I feel on this one about core vs. plugin. On one
hand most of the world uses a 24 hour clock and it doesn't take a rocket
scientist to use it, but on the other hand there are some really math
challenged people and I know for a fact that a large percentage of WP users
use a 12 hour clock in their day to day life.

Tough call.

Other than the dependency checking, is there any advantage to using  
wp_register_script over wp_enqueue_script (vs. just pulling it in with  
a standard <script> tag)?

My script is a jquery plugin, but since my theme already has it  
included I know its been loaded. Is there anything else it does that  
would warrant its use?

Thanks Daniel for working on a patch.

I think this issue is coming up because of how WordPress 2.5+ has made the
ability to schedule posts much easier to find and use. The fact that it is
only displayed in one format will bring the issue to the forefront.

Not everyone schedules posts in the future but I have been working with my
clients to help them schedule a regular posting ritual. Some have even asked
what time of day is it better to post something. Depending on their topics
it could be early morning (moms' blogs) or 10:30am (for humour and gossip
type things) etc.

I usually write two topics and schedule them apart so they appear at least
24 hours away from each other. Not that I blog that professionally but I do
have 5 blogs and it's better than having three posts in a day then nothing
for 7 days.

Scheduling posts is great thanks for all the info and effort you have put
into answering my little question.

About wp_enqueue_script() vs echo "<script>" : using
wp_enqueue_script() will allow for dependencies check and will only
load once.
Doing an echo "<script>" could result in a JS lib being included
twice, which is a waste.

if your script is a jquery plugin, just wp_enqueue_script('myscript',
'url of your script', array('jquery')) and rest assured everything
will always work.

Cool :)

So what do you all think at this point? Ozh made a suggestion on the
trac ticket that I really liked, making this a global option that can
be overridden by a user if so desired. It seems like a more elegant
way of doing this, but I'm not sure if I really understand the way the
logic would need to change to support that. Aside from less records in
the db, what other advantages would doing this have? The code would
remain the same for the most part, and maybe even slightly more
complicated (this is an assumption, I imagine that coding for a new
global option + per user overrides would be more involved than a
single user option, correct me if I'm wrong :) )

I agree with this, but I'd also point out that even though some of us
find it easy to read/set a 24-hour clock, pretty much EVERYONE knows
how to read/set a 12-hour clock. This is one of the big reasons why
I'd do this is an option in core. Sure, it might be slightly quicker
to set 24-hour time (no messing with AM/PM dropdowns), but for someone
who doesn't want to bother with the conversion, the option would be
handy.

As far as tackling the daylight savings issue while we're at it, I
think that'd be a great idea but I don't know where to start. If
anyone has any insight here I'd be happy to take a crack at it. In
creating the time format patch I already found and fixed another small
bug (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6911) so I'm in a pretty nice
groove :).

No. It depends on the complexity of your plugin/theme.

use wp_register_script if you want to enqueue the script in multiple
contexts.

You can then just call wp_enqueue_script('foo'); in the contexts that
use it - thereby reducing duplicate code.

I suppose it's related to a mix of UTC settting and locale language
setting, if i have +1 GMT and i have it_IT language setted then from
last weekend of march to last weeknd of october there it's daylight
time. If i have another GMT and it_IT there is no way to change it
automatically i think... same for swiss italian people that use WP,
same GTM of Italy but maybe different date for start and end od
Daylight saving time. 

In alternative a centra DB on automattic with UTC + or - name of the
country, start and end date of daylight saving time for that countri
and just a dropdown list with all countries, you just set the country
and GMT daylight, am/pm or 24 maybe time and date format and
textdomain for gettext is automatically setted, locale translation
team can support this DB through a page in xx.wordpress.org site for
changes parameters if necessary (sometimes ago in Italy dayligh was
different in star and end date... but this is unlucky to happens again
i think.

In other words, you can register it once, and enqueue it multiple  
times by the name you gave it when you registered it? that's pretty  
cool, but the codex has nothing on it, that i could find.

That if you create a US blog with ~20 Bloggers not everyone will have to
reset the radiobutton just because they all want the 12h format.

somewhat like

if( $user_setting == '12h' || ($user_setting == 'use_default' &&
$default_setting == '12h')) {
  // 12h code
} else {
  // 24h code
}

don't know if you want an additional OR condition with 2 AND-combined
conditions complicated - choose yourselfe.

Per User setting would be an selection list with
-- use blog default
-- 24h format
-- 12h format

Global Setting would only need a checkbox with 'use 12h time format' or a
radio button group with both 24h and 12h.

I'd also point out that even though some of us

For most people normally handling 24h format it will be no problem to say 15
= 3 BUT they will not have any idea what "am" and "pm" means. I learned it
in english lessons - but not everyone had english at school. And since there
are no abbr. for this in those languages there is no way to tell them (and
you can not use any self explaining stuff since there is no room for it)

Why not leave it 24h and allow entry of "17" "5p" or "5pm"? And have
it autoconvert.

That seems sane to me.

$time_in_12hr =  date("g:i a", strtotime($time_in_24hr));

$time_in_24hr =  date("H:i", strtotime($time_in_12hr));

You could use mktime(), but as an example, this works.

I like the global setting idea, even if it's a hidden option that you'd have
to edit through options.php or a plugin.

The problem with fixing daylight saving time (or summer time, or what have
you) is that every country does it differently.  As someone pointed out,
people in the UK won't be using a localization, so they'd get US daylight
saving time, which this year was about 3 weeks apart.  I imagine that most
of Europe works the same way, but there's no guarantee.  I'd hate to code
and maintain summer time rules for every country in the world.

Because then, when you look at the time on an existing post, you'll see 17
instead of 5pm.  That's not a problem for most of us geeks, but it sucks for
those of us who are not so gifted.

The point would be that single user blog owner should have to navigate
from Settings to Profile to change site wide stuff. It shouldnt happen
(it pisses me off every time I set up a WP blog, put settings like I'd
like in all Settings page, go to "Write" and realize I forgot to
change the damn "don't use that crappy WYSIWYG editor" setting on my
Profile page)

But that's the only one in the WP_Script family with anything on it.  
And nothing on the advantages of each vs a straight <script> call.

I'm probably more guilty than most, but we need to remember that the  
codex is a wiki. If we see something that should be fixed, we can do  
that.

I know. But it's hard to write documentation for a function that you  
just found out about and looked to codex for a clue on what it does.

	4478)
Message-ID: <8BB6CC84-FAA9-46C4-A4CB-D43E7A0B5E1A@stilldesigning.com>

I've created a patch which addresses Trac ticket 4478 (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4478 
), which allows for a custom login / registration page.  The patched  
wp-login.php file loads login.php from the current theme if it  
exists.  login.php consists of two functions, login_header() and  
login_footer(), to be called by wp-login.php instead of the default  
header / footer functions.  If there is no login.php file present in  
the theme's root folder, the current login page is displayed.  The  
included sample login.php should work in a wide range of themes.  You  
can see a working example of the login.php at my blog (link in  
the .sig).  Obviously, I'd like to see my patch applied to trunk and  
included in the next release.  I'd also love some feedback as to what  
can be improved and what might need to be changed to get the code  
applied.

Thanks,
- Dave

I didn't try this particular patch, but this is definitely the path
I'd like WP to take: allow theme integration of
non-productive/maintenance admin pages (ie login, register,
profile.php).

Hi Peter, this is Dave.  I'm the author of the login page patch for  
Trac 4478.  You mentioned in the Trac notes that moving the code to wp- 
includes would be more desirable.  Could you expand on this for me?   
I've been developing PHP apps for 8 years now, but I've only started  
hacking WordPress in the last 5-6 months, so a nudge in the right

+1 to that.

The proposal is well thought out, but one thing is missing for me:  
pluggable hooks, maybe?

	Loop
Message-ID: <C5FED343-DFB0-44B1-AD9D-888B9658B72F@chanpory.com>

Hey everyone.

I'm new to this list and a novice PHP coder, but I wanted to share  
some code I've been working on.

The goal is to enable bbPress moderators to "promote" a topic to show  
up in a Wordpress loop. Clicking on the permalink of the bbPress topic  
within the Wordpress loop, will take you directly to bbPress topic  
page. Any changes made to topic on the bbPress side would also show up  
automatically in the loop. (There is a similar functionality in  
Drupal, and I was considering migrating my Wordpress blog to Drupal,  
but it turned out to be huge pain.)

My approach was to take advantage of the "sticky" functionality in  
bbPress. The idea is to retrieve "super sticky" topics from the  
bbPress database tables, and merge it into an array of Wordpress  
posts. Then, use foreach to create a custom loop which displays the  
combined list of Wordpress and bbPress posts. From a user's  
perspective, you would simply click the "Stick topic (to front)" in  
bbPress to promote the topic to Wordpress.

So far, I've been successful in modifying the index.php file for the  
Classic theme to achieve this functionality. There is some pagination  
issues, but it seems to be working fairly well so far.

I'm not sure if it could be turned into a plugin or not. I've attached  
what I have so far as a text file. The code assumes the latest  
versions of bbPress and Wordpress, and that bbPress was installed with  
Wordpress integration enabled. Also, the tables for bbPress and  
Wordpress are in the same database.

Any suggestions for streamlining or improving this would be greatly  
appreciated:

Would it make sense to publish (wp_insertpost I think) the topic (or 
it's excerpt etc) to WordPress, and update the post (and/or publish a 
new post) when the topic is updated?

Just a google-php-er myself but off of the top of my head if you want to 
go the plugin route it would make sense to elliminate the need for 
custom loops in theme files.

Hi Andre, I'm not exactly sure what you mean.

Do you mean having bbPress publish a post directly to Wordpress? I'm  
not exactly sure how to use Wordpress functions in bbPress. Also, I  
want to bring in only select posts from bbPress to Wordpress and not  
all posts. I also don't like the idea of duplicating the entries in  
two different places.

I share your worry about the custom loops, however.

Another approach might be to edit the WordPress functions to look at  
the bbpress data and grab topics with the right meta-tag on it.  Then  
any time the regular WordPress loop is called, it is filtered to  
include the bbpress "posts".

That might be a cleaner approach with regards to themes, etc.   
Probably a plugin-able system too.

Or... Regarding using WordPress functions in bbpress, there is a WP  
file that you would include in the bbpress plugin.  Forgetting what it  
is -- wp-header.php or something like that?

You need to:  require_once('path/to/wp-blog-header.php'); in bbPress'

Fortunately, you don't have to maintain the rules yourself. It's
already been done:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoneinfo

I am currently working on a plugin to handle daylight savings time
nicely. Basically, you pick your closest city in the same timezone
(America/Chicago, for me). Then it works it out by itself.

-It works perfectly for PHP 5.1+ right now, all systems.
-It is possible to make it work on modern Linux systems that run PHP 4
also (still working on that bit).
-I don't see any way to do it with Windows boxes running PHP 4, but I
can detect that case and have the plugin tell you that it will not
function.

If the plugin is well received, perhaps I'll make a patch to integrate
it into the core.

On that page i browse to first outside link:

David (2007-11-29). Sources for time zone and daylight saving time
data. Retrieved on 2007-12-03. ) ane there there was link to a plugin:

http://kimmo.suominen.com/sw/timezone/ written since WP 1.5 that
state:

Looks like someone alredy inveted this wheel... and he said nothing :P

I've seen Kimmo's timezone plugin. It's fine, but could stand some
improvement. Also, it relies wholly on the underlying Linux system
being able to handle it, it won't work on Windows boxes.

PHP5 has better timezone handling built into it, and so I'm using
that. I'm using a similar technique as Kimmo's plugin for PHP4, but
having trouble with it on some setups. Needs more testing.

The latest version of my timezone plugin is here:

Plus, the older plugin (according to the description) was setting the 
time zone to the server's time zone, which is not appropriate for a 
lot of people. We don't necessarily host in the same time zone as we'd 
like the blog to display.

I would like to add my enthusiastic YIPPEE to Otto for attempting 
this, by the way. Time zones and daylight savings rules are EXTREMELY 
complex. I've done some programming with them before, and it's NOT 
easy to get right. Maybe there's enough in the core of PHP to support 
them in an easy way (haven't looked into it recently), but if not, 
good luck!

If you run PHP 5.1 or up, this code will figure out the correct offset
from the server for a given timezone string (like "America/Chicago"):

$dateTimeZone = new DateTimeZone('America/Chicago');
$dateTimeServer = new DateTime();
$timeOffset = $dateTimeZone->getOffset($dateTimeServer);
$timeOffset = $timeOffset / 3600;

The resulting $timeOffset is in hours, and will be what you should
choose on the Settings->General page. That's the basis for the plugin.

Great for a plugin which can easily choose to only support php5.1+
Less useable for core which should be php4.3 complient up to what
wordpress.org says...
But maybe one could add this as an additional benefit if php version is high
enogh as long as one takes care it will not break anything if php < 5.1 is
used.

Would really like to see this go core - no matter if it is possible to be
done in php < 5.1 - just make sure nothing will break...

I found a pretty good write up here
(http://drakecms.sourceforge.net/index.php?option=content&id=32&Itemid=10)
which works in PHP4 and PHP5. I'm willing to take a crack at this, but
if anyone else has already been working in this area and is close to a
solution then I'll sit it out. Thoughts?

Nice write up. That's more or less what I've been working on, although
I'm trying to avoid the need to hardcode the timezone strings into the
thing. Most Linux installs do include the zoneinfo database somewhere.
This works well with setting TZ, because if you set TZ to something
the OS does not understand, then you don't get the right results
anyway.

Hardcoding isn't ideal, I agree, but I also wouldn't want to rely on a
linux/unix-based OS-only feature.

Improving it it's necessary for sure.. i just signaled it for info not
to say your work is not good.. it is and we need it a lot if it
improves the way we manage DST, maybe with a siple one day cron it can
change the correct time when DST switch on and off

No. If you were doing it that way, you'd have 1.2, but consider it a
beta release. WordPress doesn't do it that way. Linux does, but it uses
even numbers as the stable releases and odd numbers as the unstable
releases.

Note that versioning is not something that can be determined by an
algorithm, or anything like that. You can't run a code analyser and have
it spit back something like "YOUR CODE IS AT VERSION 1.31."

It's just a human thing. If you decide that the code is ready for
version 3.0, then let it be. If you feel it's at 2.12, then let it be.

It's purely subjective, and in WordPress, it's generally Matt
Mullenweg's decision as to what the next version number will be.

Hello,

What would be the most secure way to include text files within
WordPress ? I have about a hundreds txt files that I would like to
display within WP.
The files reside in my wp-content directory.

Thanks for any pointers,

Hi Jim,
could you specify where and for what purpose you want to include them?
There are several ways one could want to do this and therefor there is not
the one and right way to do it.

Just a few examples (there will be many more things one might want to do
with textfiles):
This textfiles could hold something like a configuration
they could hold something like posts or pages
they could be display eighter like the_loop or as seperate pages
they could just be textsnipplets you want to include into your theme at
specific placed in your theme.
They could also be something like code which you will want to display inside
posts...

Message-ID: <8f93a7390805080429r30cbe2c5s25c401e2d1163ec9@mail.gmail.com>

Philosophy question time.

I'm currently re-coding a plugin of mine and the new version will require
jQuery which was added in WP 2.2.0. Bundling jQuery for people using 2.0.x
isn't worth my trouble (plus no script loader) and they can just use the
older versions of my plugin. Less features, but hey, it's their own fault
for running an old version.

So to the question: what should be the minimum WP version for the new
version of my plugin? Should I allow the plugin to run on the real min specs
(2.2) or put in an arbitrary minimum version of 2.3.3 or even better, 2.5?
Obviously I can choose to support whatever versions I wish -- it is my
plugin after all that people can chose to use or not to use. However, do you
think it's my place to be providing incentives for people to upgrade (it's
in their best interest anyway)? Or is that their business and not mine and I
should do my best to support old versions?

If I were making use of 2.5-only functions, this wouldn't be an issue -- I'd
drop support for old versions in a heartbeat, but since my plugin could
technically work with 2.2+, I'm having a tough time deciding whether to go
with the carrot and stick approach or not.

Thanks in advance for any opinions. :)

Hi Alexander,

Thank you for your reply. The text files contain transcriptions of
guitar tabs so basically, they are text snippets that I'd like to
insert in the content section of my theme.
I was thinking of creating a file (browser.php) that would fetch the
file via a GET request but I'm pretty certain this would lead to
remote file inclusion risks... Plus it wouldn't look very good
compared to the rest of the site in terms of page structure.

I'm open to any suggestions

Jim

My suggestion would be to write a short plugin (or you could put this 
in the functions.php file of your theme, but a plugin is more portable 
if you want to change themes), which would insert the guitar tab into 
the post content. Something like this:

*****
add_filter( 'the_content', 'guitartabs_insert_tab' );

function guitartabs_insert_tab( $pcontent ) {
    global $id;

    $dir = ABSPATH . 'wp-content/yourtranscriptdir/';

    // figure out which text file you need by post ID
    // or post content, and add it to $pcontent,
    // perhaps inside a set of <pre> </pre> tag?s


    return $pcontent;
}
*****

My opinion: 2.2.0. Let them keep using as old of a version of WP as 
possible, because they may have reasons for not upgrading (such as 
that authors of other plugins they are using have not gotten around to 
making them compatible with newer versions). I'm not saying it's good 
for them not to upgrade, but it is a reality for some WP users who are 
not capable of upgrading their own plugins as WP changes.

Which also means it would be helpful if WP would consider maintaining 
security fixes on a few more of the old branches. (Do we still have 
*any* branches maintained except 2.5 with security fixes, actually?) 
Many other open-source projects do this. I realize that it's a pain to 
do, but it's also difficult for plugin authors (volunteers, after all) 
to keep up with the whims of the WP core code.

I have already the same "inner"-discussion.

Based on the Admin UI redesign I planned for myself to drop all pre
2.5 versions
for NextGEN Gallery. It's a horrible work to fit the Admin pages for
two UI and
also the tagging feature (from 2.3) is a very important extension,
which I don't want
to miss anymore.

If people don't upgrade WordPress core, why should they then upgrade
your plugins ?
(Unless somebody has the motto "never touch a running system")

Some very valid points there. I think I'll go with 2.5. Saves me the trouble
of having to code conditionals to output different options page HTML for
different versions of WordPress.

Those that won't or can't upgrade can use the older versions of my plugin.

Thanks all.

If you are using WP2.5+ you could use something like what I attatched
to this mail.
Just save it as a file and put it inside wp-content/plugins and activate.

Then use it as following:
Upload whatever textfile you want to include, then write to your post:
[tfi]file[/tfi]
where file will contatin year/month if WordPress organizes your files
based an year and month.
For the file myfile.txt which was uploaded today I would write
[tfi]2008/05/myfile.txt[/tfi]
into the post.

I don't think you will have any security risks with this, since I do
not allow any "../" es to be placed inside this tag (it will simply
return nothing if you try it).

It uses the option used by wordpress to determine where the file
should be located which would leed into trouble if a file was uploaded
and then the upload directory changed - but there is a simple
workaround: don't change this option after having uploaded the files
you want to include ;-) (before having added your uploads how ever,
you can happily change it - the script doesn't depend on your uploads
being saved inside wp-content/uploads)

If you do not want your files inside the upload directory and will
upload them via ftp or whatever you can simply change the line:
 --- return file_get_contents(ABSPATH.get_option('upload_path').'/'.$content);
to fit your needs.

And users of 2.2.x could easily downgrade - right?

Yay...

Back to topic:
I'd say let them use the old versions and make new versions use whatever you
need - there is no reason for doing more work for old versions *as long as
there are no security risks* - if there are you can try fixing them and
provide a fixed version with no additional features. There is no need to go
and add new power to outdated stuff but to keep it secure would really be
sympatic.


And yes there are reasons for *not* upgrading - at least if youre running a
multi lingual blog... where the plugin is complicated and will take some
time to be updated to fit the new version...
Multi lingual blogging is great but it is really really bitchy on WordPress
- especially WP2.5.
Belive me - I tried it out and got something running but am not anywhere
near being satisfied.

I created a way to run an unlimited amount blogs with one installation and
one (or more) database (but different db prefix) now by only changing
wp-config.php and adding a folder plus .htaccess per language... but this
isn't really nice since it requires me to do each post 1 time per
language... which is obviously better then maintaining two installation and
the URLs are really pretty, but it isn't nice anyway.

Quick question.

Is there a way to override the default author URL: http://somehost.com/author/author_name

I'm working on an online music system. So the client wants the URLs to  
be http://somehost.com/dj/author_name

Looking for possible plugins or general hack recommendations.

You should be able to do it with a simple plugin that changes the value
of "WP_Rewrite->author_base".

Remember to ensure you regen the permalink to make the change take.

Apologies if this has been asked before, but is there a reason why the
author base isn't changeable through the permalinks options like the
categories? It seems to me that they are equivalently in need of
changing in some cases (i.e. when the categories are 'types' or when
the authors are 'users', 'djs', 'translators' or 'contributors'). It
would also make it a lot easier for people to translate it without
having the admin translated (along with all the headaches associated
with full translation).  Is it just that no one has coded it?

I'm helping out a guy who's having problems with his WordPress setup. He has
a blog with about 5,000 posts and 150,000 comments. Performance is
reasonable except when anyone posts a new comment -- then the page refresh
takes something like a minute. After that page load is down to a second or
three. 


Does anyone have any idea where I should look for a bottle neck? I've ruled
out plugins.

Thanks for anticipated inspiration,

Rob

Now that is a great idea. But it probably was not seen as something  
many people wanted to change. So in other words low volume of requests  
means generally is relegated to a plugin to handle.

You read my mind, this morning I was just thinking if anyone knew how  
to change

"author" to" member"

Also it would be great if there was a way to unify this with bbPress

Is it hanging on wp-comments-post.php or actually hanging on the reload

Perhaps it's slowed in the wp_allow_comment function as it looks

Ok - here is an idea how to find it:
First check the wp-comments-post.php.
Do the following:
before wp_redirect_location($location); (at the very end of the file)
add
if(get_option('mytimer')) update_option('mytimer',timer_stop(););
else add_option('mytimer', timer_stop(), '', 'no');

then go to you phpMyAdmin (or whatever you use)
and inside the options table look for the option mytimer.
this will be the time it took for going through the wp-comments-post.php.
Then you will know if the bottleneck is inside this file.

If so move the lines up and up and up until the time is reasonable again.
Then you will know where that bottleneck is.

At least this is what I would do.

Hi,

Is there any way to make wp_list_pages exclude password protected  
pages? If not, how would I do that most efficiently?

Cheers,

Timing reveals that the bottle neck is not in wp-comments-post.php -- 0.2s
out of about 40s. So the holdup must be in the redirection/reload.

Any clues, guys?

<?php wp_list_pages('exclude=1,2'); ?>

where 1 & 2 are page_ids of password protected pages.

That's not what I'm looking for, I need a more generic solution :)

Old idea. See: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1762

Although that patch seems like a heck of a lot, IMO. It should just be
a few lines, no more. Making all those extra functions seems like
overkill.

I'm not sure _why_ you'd want to do that, but there are a couple of
ways.

If they are PHP files that you want to include, you should use the
require() function, like so:

	require('the_php_file.php');

You can also do this for normal text files:

	require('the_text_file.txt');

The above command will echo the text file out to the browser straight
away. If this is not what you want, you can dump the contents into a
variable instead:

	$lolcats = file_get_contents('the_text_file.txt');
	echo "OH HAI. $lolcats KTHXBAI.";

Does this help?

If your theme doesn't allready have that in its footer.php file you could
add
<?php echo get_num_queries(); ?> queries. <?php timer_stop(1); ?> seconds.
(maybe as a html comment, if you're able to view them without reloading that
page (which some browser do when you hit view source)

If this time is huge you'll the problem comes from the generation of the
page itselfe and not from posting the comments.

Does the WP installation use something like WP Super Cache?
This would definitly mean the page is generated when you post a comment
while it isn't when you don't.

That's the strange thing: (with caching disabled) the page takes ages to
load after a comment (the footer comment shows about 50 queries and 50
seconds!) has been made but NOT at other times.

Hmm thats really strange...
maybe you could tell me how many querys are performed when you do not post a
comment...
Just for getting some ideas - you know it is really hard to go through this
if you have no access to any system with that problem ;-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] undead entries in the RSS cache
Message-ID: <4824208C.7050807@m0n5t3r.info>

Hello list

has anyone changed the secondary dashboard rss stream? I pointed it to 
the django community RSS feed, and it won't refresh. ever (well, not 
until I manually do delete from wp_options where option_name like 'rss%' 
and length(option_name) >= 36).

I initially thought the object cache was to blame (using the 
eaccelerator backend), but I've had it happen on my laptop/development 
machine as well, so I'm a bit puzzled here.

Any ideas?

Not really. The database schema is different.

To do it properly, you would need to go to Manage > Export on the 2.2.x
blog, and download the XML file.

Then, to import it into a 2.0.x blog, you need the
WordPress-to-WordPress Import plugin, which is capable of reading the
same XML files. You import the XML into the 2.0.x blog after clearing
the database.

Pain in the butt, I know.

Yep thats exactly what I wanted to point out - 2.0 until 2k10 is nice but
everyone who was such "stupid" as to upgrade until 2.2.x but than lost
compatability to 2.3 (remember: Tagging - just as an example) is left
without any support... if the one was such "intelligent" as not to upgrade
(which was recommended as far as I know) he'll be luckily supported...
strange way to do things, while I do know it is hard work to keep all
branches security fixed...

Anyway of course best is to upgrade constantly and fix every
incompatabilities... but who has the time to fix others plugins ;-)

Anyway I will get my 2.2.3 Blog updated soon - I just need some days to
rework everything running on it to not loose anything which matters... and
to overwork the template which isn't only uncompatible but also unpretty -
but holds bit too much code which I had better put into plugins -- a week
ago I allready dropped the biggest Issue which made an upgrade not only time
consuming (for template rework and plugin compatability) but totally
impossible...

I have 3 other Blogs which are running at current version - and will stay
updated forever as far as I am concerned... so I really didn't want *not* to
upgrade but when I tried (and did backup of course) everything was broken
(and of course, how else could it be) the special chars (umlauts) were
broken in that damn backup too - took me two days to get everything back
online so I really know why someone might be "update resistant" by purpose.

Yes, I have had one of the RSS feeds on the dashboard not refresh. I'm 
unsure what the problem is or if it is already fixed. I'm on trunk you 
see and I have mine set to the RSS of the WordPress Trac commit 
Timeline. It only happened once, every other time, it has worked perfectly.

It might be that the cache is set for a long time and just not updating 
fast enough.

WordPress 2.3 came out over 7 months ago. The majority of plugins have
updated since then and most of those that haven't have been replaced by
similar plugins or branched.

You're really just asking to be hacked. ;)

That's an awful lot of queries. I would try to find out which query is 
causing the hangup. Put this in wp-config.php:

define('SAVEQUERIES', true);

And then in the footer put this:

<?
if (current_user_can('switch_themes')){
    global $wpdb;
    echo "<pre>";
    print_r($wpdb->queries);
    echo "</pre>";
}

That will show you each query, what function called it and how long that 
query took to execute. I just added the switch_themes permission so all 
the regular visitors don't get a large dump at the bottom of the page, 
so you need to be logged in as an admin, or change the permission to 
something lower.

Call it however you want ;-)
Had my reasons and vanished one of them about a week ago ... ~100$/Month

Thanks to all who helped. I tracked down the code causing the delay and
found a way to optimise it.

Care to share? :) I'm interested in knowing what the problem was and
how you solved it.

Hi Stephen,

Do you have any suggestions on which Wordpress functions I should hook  
into, in order to convert this into a plugin?

Thanks,

Chanpory

It was code building an archive listing way down at the bottom of his
sidebar. I don't know why it was only slow after a new comment but I
whittled the lag down from 50 seconds to 3-5.

Elliotte,

I faced a similar problem sometime ago. But for me the wp-comments table was
corrupted. I repaired it using the REPAIR Table (
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/repair-table.html) MySQL command and
it solved my issue.

I am not sure whether you are facing the same problem like me, but just my
two cents.

Well, the back log idea wouldn't be possible I'm sure... but.. at least 
to subscribe them to ALL post comments, or posts they had commented on 
before.. so any NEW ones.. they'd get notified for.. FYI: I'd love to 
see this in 2.6... rather than plugin. It would be awesome.. to have 
this feature in the WordPress code from the get... but, if not 
possible.. it's ok. .

Thanks to Jeremy Visser... !!!
UPDATE wp_comments SET comment_subscribe = 'Y' WHERE 1 = 1;

This sets all comments to "Y" in the wp_comments table..  change the 
table name accordingly to yours.. This sets all comments to Subscribed..

Probably because the listing is cached and a new comment was forcing a
regeneration. But that's only a guess.

My thoughts exactly too.

Would have been interesting to see if Robert's friend would get 50
second loading times on every load of the page if the object cache were
disabled.

I can agree with that. I guess this is where it'd be wonderful if no one 
could join nor comment on blogs, because spam ruins it for everyone. 
People can only read them, then that's its. That will solve all the 
problems of spam, because after all.. ya can't get spam, if ya can't 
comment nor join... right? Sarcasm isn't directed towards you Mahmoud. 
It's just BS that ya can't even have a blog or anything... without

Yep and you can not write any comments on a blog where the blog owner will
at some day get to the idea that everyone should be informed if anybody does
write any comment in a post where the commenter has commented allready and
had not choosen to get Mailnotifications. Every time someone thinks he would
write a comment or spam that blog you will get mails you never asked for...

I can see what you're saying here. But, how ELSE is the plugin supposed 
to function in order to do it's purpose? Unless it goes through IP 
checks... or what not? You're basically saying, the plugin should be 
void / deleted to prevent spam right? But at same time... the whole 
plugins wonderful function is to notify legit members / subscribers of 
NEW comments to what they commented on... So! We're back at base camp 
again, where I said earlier.. it's just best to get rid of comment 
functions, user registrations, and emails... because spam ruins it 
all...? Right?

Hey all :)

I just wanted to ask a question, so I can be absolutely clear on  
this.  I submitted a request yesterday on the wp-pro list about hiring  
someone to help with installing WordPress on a IIS system that's  
running PHP and MySQL.  I am utterly *amazed* at the response - an  
overwhelming majority who did respond said the same thing: install  
WordPress on a separate Unix/Linux system and have the links redirect  
to the IIS for anything non-WP related.

Am I wrong in believing it's possible to install WordPress on a IIS  
server?

I'd never tried it before, but I had always believed that - although  
IIS will give some difficulties - you *could* install it on IIS.  (For  
the record, I'm no newbie at WP installs - I've just never done it on  
IIS before.)

If this is true, and it *can't* be done, can I have a bit of  
verification?  I told the client I'm working for (I'm actually  
subcontracting for another designer) that you *could* do it, but that  
the IIS server would make it really hard to do - which it has been.   
I've utterly failed at the task (which is why I submitted to wp-pro),  
and the client believes it can be done.  They're now hounding me  
because I've been trying to a week and a half to get it installed, and  
it's failing utterly- in the most bizarre ways.

So do I need to tell the person I'm working for that if they want  
WordPress, they have to switch from IIS?  I always thought it could be  
done - but apparently, form what I'm hearing, it cannot.  I'd really  
like some verification so I can get moving on this - maybe give them  
some other options rather than ramming my head against this wall  
trying to get it to work.

Thanks!

~Shelly

I have installed several times wordpress in IIS server, you can install, but
only think is that, you may not enjoy all the benefit and feature of the
wordpress, if you do not have root access to IIS, if you are on shared
hosting, then, it would be hell, even then it is possibile and to run wp.


all the best, i would be very happy to help you solve the problem, even then
there are lot of turorials and other helps available online.

regards

daya

It can be done, I dont know how to do it.

Get it installed with no permalinks at all first of all, And then try and  
work out what permalink options there are for IIS and WordPress, etc.

In what bizare ways has it been failing? (Someone might point out what is  
causing it)

Theres a few people on this list i know that run it on IIS (Granted,  
they've had to make slight modifications in the past i believe)

Oh come on - you know better than that.
If I hit a checkbox "Notify me for comments" I ask you to do this and then
you should send mail to me.
If I do not hit such a checkbox (for what reason ever - could be that you
hadn't any checkbox there before, could be that I just didn't want mails)
and you do it anyway this could be considered spam.

Well - one can unsubscribe of course... but if I did fall over your blog
lets say 1 and a half year ago and read one post and wrote a comment then
(where there was no checkbox) and then I'll get an email from you today
which has a signoff link in it - I wouldn't dare hitting it since this could
be spam and I would tell them my mailadress is vaild.

Just leave it open for your visitors to be notified or not - add a "Notify
me" button which can be used even if you do not comment (I use this on one
of my blogs) and don't send mail which wasn't requested to them by adding
everyone to the subscribe list...

Shelly,

I feel your pain. It's all about keeping the client happy. But part
of that is educating the client (after all, if they knew better,
they wouldn't need us). I have long since stopped supporting
Microsoft server technology. My personal opinion of the company
aside, I just don't believe it's the best choice for any kind of server.
If the client insists on a Windows server solution, I'm happy to
direct them to another consultant. The inevitable headache is
not worth any amount of money to me.

My 2 coins of the realm.

Tim

Alexander, my whole remark wasn't just about the comment notification 
plugin, it was in general. I have this contact form 
http://green-beast.com/blog/?page_id=136 currently.. and I got a spam 
email through it.. I was basically saying.. IN GENERAL... no matter 
what.. you get CRAP. A barbed wire fence around my stuff, with razor 
wires on top like around prisons.. guard dogs and all at the bottom.. 40 
anti spam plugins and stuff.. and the STUFF IS STILL getting through... 
some how.. my as well take ALL possible avenues for spam to attack out 
of the picture...

Remove the comment functions, remove registrations, remove email, remove 
ANYTHING that allows spam to get through or leech onto.. OUT OF blogs .. 
period.  Lets do it! Look at all the plugins you'd remove.. look at all 
the lesser emails of spam crap you'd get.. well.. if email was gone..ya 
wouldn't get any!! think of it!! No more nothing to worry about!!

Forget having users and enjoying a community software, forget having 
comments, forget having contact forms, just type all your contact 
informations into a page... without ANY fields for spam to get into and 
spam the hell out of! It's dreamland!! Go back to ancient days.. where 
ya have to inscribe it all onto stone.. and let others read it .. OR..   
just type out "ways to contact you".. Awww, the wonderfulness of spammer 
a-holes.. that totally ruin a persons desire to have anything online 
anymore..

It's a SAD SAD VERY SAD SHAME... but, my as well do it.. it saves so 
many  tables of the WP database... it saves so much grief.. it saves so 
much time for the anti-spam plugin authors updating code .. that gets 
by-passed anyway... aww the wonderful joy of spam... NOT! .... I'm 
sorry, but I wish I could go around capping off the spammers personally..

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible to remove elements of 2.5 admin?
Message-ID: <e1202cb10805100955x2326870ci8561cb98bca48807@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to fix a bug in this plugin http://beyn.org/sidecat/ (moves
category selector into sidebar, necessary for people like me with
hundreds of categories) that is caused by the fact that the original
category selector is still there in the html but just hidden with CSS
(you can't remove categories because the hidden original one keeps
them silently checked, also causes bigger page size and slower load
for unnecessarily because of duplicate lists).

At first I thought it would be easy, I could just remove the category
meta box with something like remove_meta_box(), as it is just another
meta box. Of course I realized there's no remove_meta_box() function,
so I loaded the $wp_meta_boxes array to try and remove it manually,
only to find it's not even in there, but instead hardcoded into the
editor template.

So, is there some other way to remove the categories box (and the
other default boxes)? It seems to me that they should all work with
the meta_box api so that people who add replacements can quickly
remove the originals (just like the wonderful widgets api which works
that way).

I realize that I could do it in a hundred other ways (filter the
category list on only that situation etc), but really what I need is
to just properly turn off the box itself. It would also be useful in a
hundred other plugin situations related to moving/altering/replacing
metabox functionality.

Is this something that would get into core if there was a patch (or
many patches to get everything into the game)?

Chanpory --

I think you would want to filter $wp_posts->get_posts  (in wp-includes/ 
query.php)

The filter at the end of that function is the_posts

This sounds like a good plugin idea.  Good luck with it.

Thats just the reason why I'd say: Don't start sending unasked mails to
anyone - not even with the best intention.

Any again: There is only one way to get rid of spam is: Find your own
solution and DO NOT SHARE IT. I love sharing, but when everyone uses the
same anti-spam algos they will stop working. Even if everyone invents his
own plugin and then shares it and then everyone uses every plugin this will
only result in the spammers finding their way though every plugin. Keep
yours private - share it with you best friends only. Let not more then 10
not-so-spam-worthy blog use it. If you need more create a new for every 10
blogs. Spammers will have a hard time: They don't know the code (which they
would do with shared plugins) they don't know where it is installed and 10
blogs aren't worth too much work for them.

I have been running WordPress under IIS for several sites since the 1.5
release so whoever is telling you it doesn't work is incorrect.  I have yet
to run into anything which doesn't work in core WordPress or any of the
plugins I am using.  I didn't have to do anything special.  Simply uploaded
WordPress to my hosting server via FTP, uploaded wp-config.php, and ran the
standard install process.  The whole process from downloading WordPress,
unzipping it, uploading it to the server, and running the install script
took me about 10 minutes, 15 at the most.

I run WordPress in a development area on my laptop too under Windows.  No
problems there either.  As long as PHP and MySQL are configured correctly, I
can't imagine why WordPress wouldn't work.

What kind of problems are you running into?

Mike

Thanks Alexander for your words of wisdom. ;) My buddies ban script is 
even secured.. PHP code wise.. so I can't even have the SAME version on 
spencerp.net... running on VB.com. They're both secured / enabled for 
each domain separately... with database access / site url access only. 
When viewing the files, ya can't even read it.

This script is not on the market... this script wasn't shared.. period. 
This script is basically a pre-ban of ips, uas, ua keywords etc.. to 
three IP levels of bannage...  is what I was using.. FRESH. It hasn't 
been used in lengthy time frame either.. and yet spam was coming 
through... But I caught and banned NEWER IPS that were spamming my blogs 
only.

Well, I did find another list of spammer ips online some where... and 
added them as well as the ones that were coming in later. I wish there 
was a way... to drop off spam / proxy IPS to a site.. everyone's site 
checks through em all, before allowing comment to appear. Only thing is, 
the load times would be heavy. I just wish there was a way...

I'm not sure what the other wordpress plugins actually do.. like, take 
each IP address match it to spam / ban list.. once checked it either 
gets banned / blocked / skipped or not. But, even with 21,000 IPS banned 
at one time.. my site was loading OK.. but not great..

a) IP comes to site...
b) it's check against known list of spammer ips
c) if load is heavy.. relieve it else where some how..

I'd love to be able to ADD spam / proxy ips to a main frame site / 
database.. and help others as well as me too.  I'm sure load times will 
be killer.. but it'd still be awesome to add them some where .

Yep sure - everything allright - I don't say every secret script is a hit
and will kill spam... and I don't belive in IP-Block being a protection
agains spammers. It is a protection against known spammers slowing down your
site but thats that... in my eyes.

What I ment is spam protection onsite.

Spam Karma 2 works pretty good for me - no spam did manage it onto my site
since I installed it. But they keep getting closer and closer to the border
were they would be published... I see them coming and all I can do it
setting the rules a bit tighter everytime they come too close. There is not
much room left and some of my visitors need to do an extra captcha for
varifiying they are human...

I can see the end of SK2 protecting my blog is near - it comes nearer and
nearer every single day and it trashes about 80 to 120 spam comments every
day - while about 6 per day are near being published.

I will have to write something to prevent them to do that.
There are easy ways to manage this - while I am not too sure how long it
will take them to get around that easy ways... but everything one could
imagine they will burn out if too many people are using them... we had this
discussion on this list not long ago so I think there is nothing more to add
then what Matt allready said (Attatched)

And inside the post Matt linked:

I wrote a [code] and [pre] shortcode plugin[1] which also allows optional

Already open source. Google for the "fauxML" plugin, produced by
Automattic.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Discussion About BackPress
Message-ID: <48265F75.2020700@santosj.name>

It appears this discussion is hot on the bbPress forums, and mailing 
lists. I do not subscribe to the bbPress forums/mailing list and would 
rather not be part of that community at this time. I was wondering if 
anyone has heard anything about it, the history behind it, and where the 
future is going.

The repository. Well, it is difficult to talk about a product that is in 
the early works. I know from my past projects that most of the work 
didn't come together until towards the end, so I can understand that 
saying, "It sucks!" does nothing to further the thought process going on 
with BackPress, (it does remind me of a project I've seen on the IRC 
chat and that project was equally terrible).

Food for Thought:

Objects Design is not so simple as throwing a bunch of functions 
together into an object and calling them methods.

Class Patterns are there for a reason, to get past the limitations of 
language design to improve the work flow of the component's design.

The desire to keep an object small is logical from the fact that once 
the object is initiated, the methods, and data must be stored in memory 
during the duration that the object is in use. (This might not be true 
of PHP, but it is of at least other languages, so one could assume.)

One problem I've seen with other applications in their usage of objects 
is that they either separate everything and build off dependency off 
dependency, creating something that goes so deep it is almost impossible 
to comprehend the work flow and impossible to easily change anything 
without complete redesign/restructure.

The second problem is that once a bad design is locked in, it is then 
impossible to change because of backwards compatibility issues happen.

I'm no expert with object software design, but over the years of making 
more than my fair share of mistakes, I've learned a thing or two.

The code behind the [sourcecode] feature can be found in this plugin (Matt
shared the code with me and then mdawaffe and I improved it a little):
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/

I'm going to be eventually deprecating that plugin for a jQuery powered one
though. Unlike SyntaxHighlighter, it'll produce valid XHTML and will be
faster (I think).

fauxML only does YouTube and Google Video AFAIK and it's API has been
superseded by the shortcodes API in the WordPress core.

As an installer for Install4Free, I've installed WordPress on a _lot_ of
different hosts, and let me tell you, the IIS-based ones always have
problems in one way or another.

It's just generally glitchy. Pages don't redirect properly, pages only
half-load, permalinks don't work, emails don't get sent, etc.
Apache-based plans even on the same hosts work heaps better.

GoDaddy + IIS is a recipe for disaster.

Occasionally, I have had problem-free IIS installs, and when it does
work, it's damn faster than an Apache+PHP+Linux solution, but they're
rare.

I guess if it works for you, that's great news, but I think you must be
lucky to have a good host. Most IIS-based hosts suck.

Would you be comfortable doing it in JavaScript?

        function removeContent(id) {
        
          var node =
            document.getElementById(id);
        
          if (node) {
            node.parentNode.removeChild(node);
            node = null;
          }
        
        }

Credit goes to Paul Fenwick, who showed this JS example in a lightning
talk ("Fixing the web") at linux.conf.au this year.

jQuery('#yourelement').remove();

In my experience, that only happens on unmanaged dedicated hosts :)

Thank you all for that.  I *thought* you could - but when the only  
responses I got from the "pro" list was "move to linux" I was really  
surprised.

 >>Get it installed ... In what bizare ways has it been failing?  
(Someone might point out what is causing it)<<

That's the thing :)

The first time I tried, it couldn't find the wp-config.php file - even  
though it was there.  Then I remembered that Windows likes full paths,  
not relative ones, so I changed ti to a full server path - and it  
worked.  but then I kept getting wp-settings.php errors.  The first  
few times I thad to do with another relative path - tried changing  
that, and then I realized that if I did, I'd have to comb through ALL  
of the files to change everything to full paths.  After a few days of  
trying to do something (I tried all kinds of things) I finally deleted  
everything off the server and reuploaded to start over.  Same issues.

Then something bizarre happened - I deleted everything, and moved over  
to my PC (normally I work from my Mac) and re-uploaded everything from  
my PC.  Things actually started working when I did that.  I got a  
little bit further, and then I started getting errors again, but these  
errors were all new.  SO I deleted, re-uploaded, and more all-new  
errors showed up (the last ones were gone - these were new ones) so  
then I started finding the files that were coming up in the errors and  
uploading them one at a time.  It seemed to fix it - until I came back  
to the wp-settings.php file.

Well, i tried twice to delete and reupload, and then suddenly it  
took.  I started going through the installation process, and when it  
started building the database tables, instead o giving me a screen  
that gave me my password, it went directly to the blog home page.  I  
decided then to go into phpMyAdmin to change my password - and now I'm  
locked out of phpMyAdmin.  I change my phpMyAdmin password 4 times,  
and it refuses to let me in.

Someone else provided me with a little script to retrieve your  
password, and when I used it, I discovered that the wp-users table  
wasn't installed - so the reason it shot past the password part was  
because it didn't give me one.

So now I have to call the host and see why I can't get into  
phpMyAdmin, and when that gets sorted, I gotta take it all down and  
try again.

And that's what I mean by "failing bizarrely".  To *me*, it sounds  
like something on the server is corrupting the files as I upload (I  
remember seeing a lot of errors in my FTP screen while uploading - but  
then it would try again and it would be fine).  The fact the uploading  
via my Mac working differently than from my PC is *way* weird (using  
the same FTP program - FileZilla).  But the BIG weirdness is that  
somehow I got locked out of phpMyAdmin altogether - which makes  
*absolutely* no sense to me.  I don't know if the server just didn't  
like my activity and decided to lock me out, or they actually have  
some freakishly stupid server setting that allowed WordPress to try  
and change the password (and it changed the wrong one and effectively  
wiped out access).

Man, I hate IIS.

Well, anyway, I have to call the host in the morning and see what's up  
with the phpMyAdmin - but since I had no luck on the forums or the wp- 
pro list, if anyone *here* knows how to do this, I'd happily hire  
you!  I don't have the luxury of telling them to switch hosts, because  
I'm subbing for someone who actually has the client under their belt -  
and the client is happy where they are.

Thanks :)

I've found that nine times out of ten when things change behavior when I
move from/to a Mac/PC it has to do with the end of the line character(s).
Specifically, Apple's TextEdit tool has some funky mojo there, and I find I
need to be very careful.

HTH,
Chris

Windows and *nix have different EOL styles, so that's perhaps not too
surprising.

I just had a quick loot at it and look working fine, easy, simple,
effective... great.

Is there any way to submit wp Pages as drafts, for admin approval, the way
you can with posts? So far, I have not been able to find a plugin to
accomplish this, and there doesn't seem to be any way inherent in WP itself.

Thanks for any advice.

Bonus idea: use role slug.

Looks great!

On the page where you have selected a time zone (it says when the  
timezone switches, etc, which is really helpful because I never  
remember) you should add what the current server time is and what you  
converted it to just so the admin can verify that the clock is right  
all around.

I had the same thought when I read the problem description.  I always use
the ".zip" download as opposed the to the ".tar.gz" download.  I also use
Vim for all of my editing on the PC.  Vim is very smart about EOL issues
between Unix and Windows.

Awesome plugin!

However the configuration page should be located under "Settings". Besides
being the "proper" place for settings pages, it'd allow me to use it on my
client's WPMU installs. ;)

It should be in core, not a plugin, IMNSHO.  The time zone metaphor is
one that people inherently "get", versus having to twiddle with UTC
offset every 6 months or so, inevitably leaving a certain number posts
mis-timestamped.

Something to consider, what happens when a user without publish level
permision wants to modify a previously approved page? Is there some kind
of version handling functionality in WordPress, if not should there be or
is this plugin teritory?

Matt disagrees with you, last I checked. Plugin settings should be
under plugins, as I understand it.

Note that both WordPress.com stats and Akismet keep their
configuration screens under "Plugins" as well.

Is that true? If so, I strongly disagree. The end user should not have 
to think "Oh, is this setting from a plugin or from the core of 
WordPress?" in order to figure out where to look for a given setting. 
Semantically, they are all settings, and they should be located in the 
Settings section. Especially since something like this might get put 
in the core soon (we can hope so, anyway), and then it would be 
located under Settings for sure.

That's my 2 cents anyway...

That's right: this makes sense from a usability perspective. One of
WordPress's chief virtues is its extensibility, and the way that it's
extended should be transparent to the end user; in other words, they
shouldn't have to figure out which feature is from a plugin and which
is core.

Something else to consider is the weight of precedent: almost all of
the popular plugins I can think of off-hand use the Settings and
Manage sub-menus.  Akismet may be an exception, but since its
configuration page has to do with the plugin per se and not the site
at large--it's just an activation key---it makes sense for it to be
where it is.

Thats not true for many plugins take nextgen gallery under Settings
there is the configuration for the large and various settings, why?
Cause the setting are yes for plugin but they interact with the
rapresentation of the plugin to the users and influece the admins side
as well (i.e. adding function to write admin screen.

This plugin interac chamgins settings available in setting menu so it
should stay under that menu as well or better , if possible, adding
thaeyr settings in the apge where time is setted.

I rellay like to see it into the core soon, maybe with a fancy
interface with some ajax like i posted this morning.

+1. I've always felt that Akismet & Co. were very odd to place their
settings on the Plugins page. I expect that page to deal with the
administration of plugins on the system as a whole (adding, removing,
updating, etc.) not for individual plugins' configurations.

Looking into it I see that there are four relevant capabilities: 'Edit
Pages', 'Edit Published Pages', 'Edit Other's Pages' and 'Publish
Pages'.

I'm not sure what the default values are, but if you use the Role
Manager plugin you can assign only Edit Pages to a given role and they
will be able to create (but not publish) new pages (I tested this and
in the write screen you only see 'save' and 'submit for review' when
writing a page without the 'publish pages' capability).

I HIGHLY recommend the Role Manager plugin to anyone dealing with more
than one or two authors ever, if only so you can see exactly what
privileges the different roles (author, editor etc) have from within
the admin screens.

I'm not sure exactly how the 'Edit Other's Pages' capability works in
practice (I've found the equivalent posts capability behavior strange
but logical in the past), but if you spend some time testing it in two
browsers with two user accounts (one low privs and one admin,
otherwise you'll go insane) I'm sure you can figure out the details.

[crossposted to ticket, which i'll close for now]

So if Matt really has a different opinon on that it is his very personal
opinon and can be totally ignored.

Besides I have to say it would be simply silly to offer hooks which
shouldn't be used... like "add_options_page".
And this plugin doesn't change it's own settings but the blogs settings as
far as I understood it.

Yeah, I couldn't agree with the codex more. The majority of plugins who
place sub-pages in the Plugins menu are wrong IMO.

@ Jeremy Visser: That video is hilarious and informative, thank you.

@ Ozh: Thanks a lot, that is a very useful one-liner that will fix the
plugin for now.

However, I have to run the js AFTER the #categorydiv has already
loaded (i put it in admin_footer). Is there some way I can have it be
removed before/as it is loaded, so that the browser never even gets
it?

As it is our long category list (all countries, tons of topics and
tons of languages) actually causes a long wait as it is loaded, which
is felt as seeing the top of the page (including the sidebar which
actually comes first in the HTML) but waiting for the #categorydiv to
load before you can see the bottom (and before the
editor/media-buttons resolve fully with their js). With the CSS and
Jquery to turn off the div once it's loaded this means a long wait
with nothing to show in the end. In our specific case we also have the
tags div turned off through CSS because we just don't use tags, which
I think adds to the time spent floundering just below the post box but
before the 'advanced options'.

I tried actually removing the tags and categories blocks from
wp-admin/edit-form-advanced.php and the whole write page sped up like
crazy and behaved how I would expect despite the fact that the one
sidebar instance of the categories still existed.

Thoughts? It still makes sense to me to use the metaboxes api for the
default metaboxes. Having a way to fully remove unwanted elements
makes more sense than faking it with js and css (not to mention the
maintenance nightmare of using content scraping as was done in the
past). It would also make it easier to do little things like move the
tags into 'advanced' without actually changing anything about the
metabox itself. We love it with the widgets, and so far I'm loving it
with the Dashboard Widgets, why not the write panel too?

Thanks Viper, though that does the same thing as having it in the
footer, but lets me put it in the header (which is good :). I still
have to wait for the list to load before the boxes dissappear (happens
at the same time as the media icons/visual editor pop in).

If you want to remove something before it appears, the only client
side way I know is CSS, ie adding in your <head>:
#stuff {display:none}

Then, actually using javascript to remove it from the DOM can still be useful

As far as I know there are 3 types of EOL:
CR (Mac)
LF (*nix)
CRLF (Win)

The Problem with something working after transfer is that you need to
transfer it in text mode - which will convert the EOL to whatever the
targetsystem uses. Most FTP Clients offer (good) automatic selections, but
even the best of them fail sometimes and transfer a (normally well known)
text-format file as binary without converting the EOLs which can in fact
stop PHP working correctly.

In fact I often get errors when uploading files (while coding on client
systems, which needs many uploads, it will sometimes break things.
I don't know why it has this problems, but it definitly has. I am working
with FileZilla and with WinSCP and this errors occured with both.

(Working on Win with *nix Servers)

Hopefully there will be something invented to stop this problems someday but
today one may have to live with this problems. Best way is: Select textmode
to transfer textfiles (manually) and select binary mode to transfer binary
files (like images, pdf, etc.pp.).

If we really wanna go crazy, you could remove it via the output buffer.

If you really mean it - just create your own write page.
You can reuse most of edit-for-advanced - you can see which stuff should be
enqueued via admin_print_scripts (not admin_head - this is just too late...)
in post-new.php.

Since writepanel doesn't have its own hook (like add_options_page or
add_manage_page) you will need to use add_submenu_page('post-new.php',....).

Most of what you have to do is copy and paste from edit-form-advanced and
then delete what you do not want.

This is the same as costomizing edit-form-advanced, while it is outsourced
into a plugin which will make it a bit more updateproof as the plugin will
not be overridden.

But I have to admit I do not know of any way to remove the "old" write
post/page Menuentries...

Hi I'm trying to add a rewrite rule for a plugin but get this error:

'Call to a member function add_rule() on a non-object'

Is there a best way to implement this function?

Any help much appreciated.

If you're even _thinking_ about using TextEdit to edit script files,  
go download TextWrangler (free) and use that instead.  Outstanding  
text editor, and very compatible (not to mention grepalicious!)

Thanks guys, I have this working but inconsistently.  It seems that
canonical url's can sometime times interfere with the rewrite.

If I add .html to the regex a trailing backslash is appended to the
rewrite and it results in a 404.  If I instead use .foo at the end of
the regex instead of html the rewrite works fine.

This caused some confusion for me.  Is anyone aware of how to prevent
the addition of the trailing backslash?

Also nothing works if I add anything to the end of /user/authorname/

For example - /user/authorname/foo/ doesn't work, again the canonical
url's function is doing something funny.

Go to Settings > Permalinks, and change your permalink settings to not
include a trailing slash on the end of the %postname%.

Believe it or not, that's where you set it.

Well, we have yellowish alert boxes, for when Aksimet needs configuring etc,
so why don't we have messages appear after a plugin is activated saying:

Thanks for installing the Foo Plugin; you can find this at 'Manage' ->
'Foo'.
<link to page>Go there now?</link>

That way, people know where to find the options page, and the plugins can be
more integrated with the menus as they currently are.

Any thoughts?

When the canonical urls were first implemented they broke a ton of
stuff on our site so we just turned them off. Makes your custom URLs
act a lot more like you expect them to (you can add ?x=y to the end of
things again!):

 ///////////////////////////////////////////////
 // TURNS OFF WP'S BUILT IN CANONICAL URLS FUNCTION
 remove_filter('template_redirect', 'redirect_canonical');


Obviously not the ideal solution, but if your special urls are more
important than the canonical effect it can be a decent tradeoff. (i'm
not sure exactly what the situation was, but i remember thinking that
it would be very impractical to keep them on).

My God.

I wanted to thank you all for your little tidbits of information.  Put  
together as a whole, I actually got it to work.

The BIG thing was the EOL at the end on a Mac.  When I deleted the  
whitespace at the bottom of wp-settings.php, all the errors went  
away.  I was still having an issue with the install.php redirecting to  
a 404 error when I tried to install it, but I solved that by going  
*directly* to the installation file, rather than redirecting to it.

I had a thread on the forum about the issue, too - but I just posted  
my full "how I got it to work" response, in case anyone else came  
along and needed to know.

But I *sincerely* appreciate you all on this - wow.  I never would  
have figured it out if it weren't for you smarties ;)

Almost every post I've written or edited since upgrading to 2.5.1 (from

also have a draft of the same post, sometimes with non content. It feels 
like this is a side effect fo the fix to prevent simultaneous edits from

Is there any way to prevent this? Once I publish a post can't all the

It seems like this is something that some helper functions should be  
created so that plugin developers can "do the right thing".

Examples for two plugins:
"Frobtnitz" -- This is a plugin that has a one-time configuration.   
You won't ever change this.
"Zorkmid" -- This plugin has settings that you might change anytime  
you change the look and feel of the blog.

register_plugin("Frobnitz", false, frobnitz_setup);
register_plugin("Zorkmid", zorkmid_settings, false);

Which would create yellow boxes like this:
"Successfully installed the "Frobnitz" plugin.  You should now  _set  
it up_."
"Successfully installed the "Zorkmid" plugin.  You can now change it's  
_settings_."

On the plugins page, there would be a link for "Frobnitz" at the top,  
like Akismet.
Next to the entry for Zorkmid on the plugin page there would be a link  
added for "Settings" so that an admin could go directly from the  
plugin description to the settings page.

This could be extended to include a way to register a "manage" page as  
well.

This way all this magic would just work for plugin developers and if  
Wordpress wanted to change this in the future they could without  
having to worry about breaking tons of plugins.

Ciao!

 Matt doesn't say it should be put into plugins menu. He says one needs to
clearly comunicate whats going on and what has to happen and where what
can be found.
> why don't we have messages appear after a plugin is activated saying:
Which would be perfectly what Matt asks for.

I don't think there is much to argue.
Everyone has the choise out of a set of hooks. Every hook available is
usable and every plugin author should choose the best fitting way to
integrate his plugin (and this will in most cases not be *plugins menu*
because there are not too many plugins dealing with plugins.

If WordPress would want to change the (well thought of) way my
plugins behave and change their menu locations whenever it feels like doing
so, I would really ask myselfe why I ever started working with and coding
for it.
Just imageine: You write documentations, manuals, make screencasts and then
some crazy person comes along and changes his mind and says - no move
everything there now and all your documentations is invalid, you will have
to deal user questions and users who know where to find what they are
looking for will get mad searching for the pages which were once there and
are now gone to be somewhere else while they didn't do anything to the
plugin.

There was an extended discussion about this about a year ago.  I  
submitted a patch that allowed a new "management link" header in  
plugins so it would show up on the plugins page forf activated  
plugins.  I never heard a thing back on it, so I never took it any  
further.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4498

I hate the idea of dialogs upon activation.  Get out of my face.  I'll  
go to management when I want to.

Ultimately, there are two types of settings pages:

1) Pages that you might want to come back to
2) "Set and Forget" pages, e.g. Akismet

I think the idea would be to have an "Options" (or now, "Settings")  
link for the first type, and for the second type, maybe a "set up" link.

Settings pages would still be in whatever other menu "Settings" or  
"Manage", etc., but there would also be a column in the plugins page  
that would have links to those same pages, as appropriate.

For the "set and forget" types, there really only need be a link from  
the plugins page itself.  This solves the clutter issue with Settings  
pages that really aren't needed after first use.

I spoke a little harshly there.  I _did_ hear back, and the thought  
was to wait for the 2.5 refresh.  So, I guess it's good that the  
discussion is back.  :)

Looks nice, and they even included WordPress in the URL to show the
appreciation

Wondering whether or not I should join their annual membership again... :p

Uhm....  Huh?

I'm talking about an API to make life easier for plugin developers to  
create plugins and for core developers to be able to innovate without  
getting in each other's way.

If the wordpress devs want to change how hooks work or something like  
that, then it won't matter as long as the register_plugin() API remains.

I wasn't talking about moving the hooks to different pages, though it  
does offer an entry point for someone to make that change if he/she  
wants.  I doubt the WordPress devs will do that though, don't you?

Ciao!

They don't have powered by in the footer, so I wouldn't be so sure
that they did it intentionally to give credit.


And Ouch, they are using 2.0.2.

Sorry, then it seems I misunderstood what you ment, for me it sounded just
like giving them the possibility to put the plugin pages wherever they like
them whenever they like to...

> I doubt the WordPress devs will do that though, don't you?

I don't think they would but you can not be too sure about that one (they
have done some  - in my uneducated opinion - totally misleading UI decisions
before, while WP has still one of the best open source UIs available) -
while I have to say - they could do it today too...

Just interpreted your message as something about the "Matt disagrees with
this" stuff... and I just think it doesn't really matter what Matt thinks,
when it comes to plugins which are their authors territory...

I just closed that ticket as a duplicate of  
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5660

While it doesnt allow the exact same functionality as originally  
requested, It can be of use, I just wrote up a plugin to showcase the use  
of hte filter:

http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/test-configure-link.php

As you can see.. i added the usual activation/deactivation stuff as  
expected.

It would've been nice to have the action links run through another filter  
like "plugin_action_links-$plugin" though.. It'd save having to have the  
function work out what links it needs to filter or not. I originally just  
ran it through the single filter to allow easy addition of a Uninstall  
link globally or whatever.

A user knows what plugins they have and have not activated, and they
should not have to hunt around to find where the settings for a plugin
they just activated are.

So I disagree with you and I agree with Matt in this case, and my
plugin configuration pages are going into the plugins menu.

It makes sense to me as well that the plugin options are better placed
into the plugins menu. However, there are plugins that fits better
under other sections, such as a plugin that manages category orders
should better be placed under the "Manage" tab.

For our WPMU site, we have used another approach. To improve user
experiences, we have added a specific meta link in the plugin file
descriptions. The link will only show up when the plugin is activated.
If the plugin is just a widget, the link points to the widgets.php
page, and if the plugin adds a page on the management section, the
link goes to that section accordingly.

There's a difference between a "user" and an "admin."  The admin knows
what plugins are installed,  and the admin may be in the dashboard
only long enough to activate and configure the plugin.  The user just
knows, for example, that she wants to manage X, so she's going to look
under "Manage."

I'm not sure how far to go with the "what Matt thinks" line, but I
don't believe that's his view, based on what he said at the recent
Milan WordCamp.  See about 40 seconds into this video:
http://www.vimeo.com/1007293?pg=embed&sec=1007293
Someone asks why the new dashboard looks like it does, and he replies,
"what we decided to do was to allow more room for plugins to expand
all the different sides, to break it into menus organized by different
action types. . . . and now there's room for . . . plugins to expand
the menu."

Besides, to a certain extent it doesn't matter what Matt thinks, for
the reason you mention: *you* control where you put your plugins' menu
options.

>> Something else to consider is the weight of precedent: almost all of

>

That analogy assumes that putting settings under "Settings" and
manageable items under "Manage" is like jumping off a bridge, and I'm
not convinced it is.  The main reason I disagree is that the other
position looks at menu organization from the structure of the *code*
rather than the structure of *usage.*  In other words, it says that we
should put X plugin options under "Plugins" because X's code happens
to be in a plugin.  I'm convinced that it's more user-friendly to look
at things from the perspective of use: if something manages something,
it belongs under "Manage."  My experience working with clients further
convinces me, because usually they don't care whether it's a plugin or
core functionality that lets them accomplish X; they just want me to
set it up so they can do X.

I think people might be confusing the issue here. We're arguing at the
semantic level, but the real problem is that there are TWO places to
stick plugin settings menu, when there should only be ONE. I honestly
don't think any user would care whether plugin settings are under
"Settings"  (or whatever) or under "Plugins" - it's the ambiguity that
makes this annoying.

Stick all my plugin settings in one place so I don't ever have to
wonder about where those new settings might be.

If you delegate setting management (but not plugin on/off) to
non-admins it makes more sense to have settings related to plugins
(like say the content of a contact form, or the text about your
podcast) in settings rather than the plugin menu, as those users
shouldn't even see the plugins menu item at all. Pretty good argument
in favor of putting them under settings IMHO.

I think we could argue this to death, and although my opinion is that any
kind of setting should go under settings, regardless as to whether it is a
setting defined by a plugin, I think that some kind of standard should be
established so that when an admin or a user wants to change a setting,
they know where to go to do that, and they shouldn't have to click through
several menus to find what they want.

Now I believe its just a matter of choosing one, and that seems to be a
difficult choice! This should then be recommended, but if someone choses
differently, then they will have chosen for a reason...

Message-ID: <1fa535a70805141346s48d51c8am6543202f34c79624@mail.gmail.com>

I use Subversion to update my WordPress installs. As it stands, with
the 2.5.x development occuring under /branches/2.5 and not /trunk, it
means if I have an install which uses
svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.5 and do an svn up, I'll get
the latest alpha instead of the latest stable release in that branch.

In order to get round this I've tried using tags/2.5.x but this means
I have to do an svn switch each time a new release is announced.
Anyone updating a 2.3.x blog with Subversion can just use
/branches/2.3 as only the latest stable release goes in there.

Anyone else using Subversion to update their 2.5.x blogs this way?
Which method are you using?

I use the switch-to-a-tag method with success so far.  Why don't you
like that approach?

Use the tags and "svn switch" when you want to upgrade to another release...

Sorry, didn't read the rest of your message.

What's wrong with "svn switch"? Do you just not want to put in a new URL?

Why would you do an "svn up" very often anyway, if you don't want new changes?

I understand the problem.  He DOES want updates, but he only wants 
stable updates.  The problem with SVN Switch is that it's not easy to 
automate. I have a lot of WordPress installs that I manage, and it would 
be nice to just set a cron job to "svn up" every day (or once a week, 
etc). There is a trac ticket asking for a stable tag like phpMyAdmin 
does: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3593

I understood that. Seriously, that's where you set it. That's why I said
"believe it or not".

If you have a look at the WP_Rewrite code, it bases whether it puts a
trailing slash on _all_ permalinks on whether your post permalinks end
in a trailing slash or not.

Funky, I know.

I do that on a project of mine, and it's a pain in the butt to work.

Already talked about it with Lloyd in private about 6 months ago, and we
were pretty conclusive that there's no way to make it easier on the
developers.

Not gonna happen.

That kind makes sense, although when it comes to upgrading anything I
generally don't want it to happen automatically. It should be easy to
do only when I want it to happen. "svn switch" does that. And if the
only argument is "typing a URL is too long", bear in mind that
someone, somewhere, is going to have to update this stable tag and if
there is a mistake then _everyone_ will be screwed.

If someone wants to avoid the hassle of typing in a url after "svn
switch" I'd recommend a shell script that takes the version number as
an argument... i.e. "upgrade_wp 2.x", which would then run "svn
switch" with the appropriate URL.

Short of having a stable tag I think there are other things that  
could be done to help automate things.

http://api.wordpress.org/ provides a few services, like:

	http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.0/
	http://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.0/

I'd suggest having:

	http://api.wordpress.org/current-version/1.0/

That would return one line that contained just the version string, if  
it were in place today it would return: 2.5.1
The version number would be a tag that could be used to checkout the  
source code from subversion.

Along with that would be something like:

	http://api.wordpress.org/current-branch/1.0/

Which would also only return one line, that contained the current  
branch, if it were in place today it would return: 2.5
Instead of a tag, it's a branch that could be checked out from  
subversion.

Please don't get hung up on the names in the URLs, they were just  
examples.  Any name/URL combination will do as long as it works as  
expected and was reasonably descriptive.

If you only wanted to update when a new version came out, you would  
query for the current version, svn switch to that tag, svn up and do  
any WP specific (like the database) updates that needed to happen.

Users don't know anything they only use stuff. They do not care how the
admin made things working they just use them. If you can not understand this
you never set up a blog for a client - but maybe you would be able to
imagine a client is happy enogh if he just finds what he'd search under

Ok - Matt has made WordPress the #1 Blogging Platform in the world all by
himselfe. It wasn't the comunity nor the plugin builders. /irony-off
You say all those plugin builders are wrong? Where would WP be without them?
Not nearly where it is now - so they can not be such wrong at all nor did
they jump off a bridge.

>my plugin configuration pages are going into the plugins menu.
Please do me a favor and overthink this issue when you create a plugin where
a 'user' (not admin!) needs to be able to manage or write anything. I do not
give admin-login to my clients and I don't allow the plugin menu for them.
It is fine to add pages like the one of akismet there, since they are
PluginSetup and will never be needed again. Sometimes I allow settings -
sometimes I don't. If I do not I wouldn't want one to mess around with the
settings and therefor wouldn't want any settings somewhere else. If I do
allow them, but do not allow plugins I want exactly this: Don't change
plugins, do not install/deinstall them and do not start managing them. But
if you want - change the options.

You know: The menu also deals with the permissions and therefor one really
needs to think it over what a pages really does and one should add it to the
right menu...

>I think that some kind of standard should be
>established so that when an admin or a user wants to change a setting,
>they know where to go to do that

Standards are nice as long as there is something which can fit into
standards rules. Since WP Plugins do totally different stuff and hook into
everything WP offers they need to spread the menues around just like they
spread features.

The recommendation is: Think about what you do before you do it and ask
yourselfe where someone would actually search for something. If you only
have settings it should be obvious. If you have an installation routine you
wouldn't even need a menu entry - if there would be any possibilities to ask
the admin for some installation data which wouldn't need to change at any
time. This would be a nice feature!

Another one is: Put your stuff where the users which should be able to use
it will be able to do and there where users which shouldn't aren't able to.
The last one can easily be dropped, since it is easy to check permissions
and die if they aren't met. The first one can not since when there is no
"plugin" menu you can not access any "plugin menu pages". No matter how hard
you try. Therefor you shoulnd't place anything which an editor, author or
contributor would need access to inside plugins menu obviously - no matter
if it is part of a plugin or not.

Here's one that does exactly that:

On this, something I think should be considered is a catch all plugin 
page for settings. I have seen some clients have so many smaller plugins 
loaded, which all have their own settings page and only one or two 
settings in there. After awhile, the submenus start getting very 
unmanageable.

Perhaps something along the lines of a settings sub page under plugins 
with an API to easily add a setting to that page, which appears under 
the plugin name. No plugins use that page? Don't show that settings sub 
menu under plugins. Akismet would be a good candidate for such a page, 
and probably a good way to get it kicked off, so it would go something 
like this:

AKISMET
.
.....Key
......Autodiscard
.
.
.
Next plugin
.
....setting

etc
etc



I know personally there have been times I have written stuff and decided 
to say "change this on line X in plugin.php to what you want", instead 
of hooking in a special page for just a single option.

Well one could take it to the extend to give the blog admin the coice where
the menu entries should show up if you do not use "add_options_page" (or
alike) hook but use add_submenu_page($this->settings_page_hook,...)
and give sttings_page_hook a default value (maybe Plugins) which can be
changed if is_admin() == true.

Then they would be able to change where that menu appears. Maybe this could
be made more easy by core and the pluginname_pagehook[number] option would
be used and could be set within the plugins main page so nobody would need
to search again since they see what is the default and could adjust it to
fit their needs. One should make it possible to use more then only one
pluginname_pagehook since there are plugins which need more then only one
page. (For example a write and a manage and a settings page)

I track the current branch. Theoretically, the branch is receiving 
mostly bugfixes. And any new features that do go in will not be major 
changes likely to break anything. I just keep an eye on the svn mailing 
list to see what changes are going in. If something particularly 
important to me is fixed or added, I update.

Its called an 'anti-pattern' and it happens all the time - even to the  
best developers. New plugin developer wonders where to put it, and  
puts it where others are putting, figuring they may know something  
about the 'right' way to do it. There are plenty of plugins that I  
wish weren't where they were, but there they are, and I get used to  
it. My clients use limited accounts, and I just handle the sticky  
details of plugin configuration, so it works for me. YMMV.

Personally, I think that they should placed in a "logical" location,  
based on use. However, I don't think the whole of the community would  
ever agree on what logical means for any given plugin. Though the  
freedom for the plugin developer to choose is exactly why the hooks  
are there.

Perhaps we can actually discuss what the best practices could be and  
commit them to the codex? That way new developers are given guidance  
when they need it, and over time the best practices will become the  
norm.

Please go on. I'd like to see the reasoning behind not having a stable  
tag that represents the same revision as /tags/2.5.1, etc?

Its trivial create two tags, one for the named version, and one for  
the standing 'production/stable' tag. And given that WP doesn't  
release a build lightly, it seems like it would add very little  
overhead to whatever the existing process is. And if the process is  
automated, then the overhead would be barely non-existent.

There's Google Gears offline storage support in trunk (rev. 7938). It 
only works with Firefox 2 and IE6 & 7 for now, soon with Safari 3.

At the moment it shows the status on the dashboard, but will move it to 
an "on demand" popup, as it's not essential once Gears is enabled.

Has anybody played with Gears before? Any thoughts/suggestions/remarks?

Does SVN have any inbuilt aliasing functionality?

A different branch could be created, and every time a release is made, its  
commited into that branch as well, but that seems a bit much of an extra  
step to me.
So is it possible to setup a alias so that /branch/stable/  =>  
/tags/2.5.1, and that a quick update could set it to 2.5.2?

If SVN doesnt(I couldnt see much on a quick google), Could the  
svn:external property be used instead? ie. /branches/stable/ has the  
property of svn:external tags/2.5.1, Any checkoutof /branches/stable would  
pull in /tags/2.5.1, and then any updates would be able to pull in the  
other branch.. Or is that not possible with the way svn:external works?

I'm just rambling out loud, I think a "Latest stable release" tag/branch  
could be of great use to many people, but i dont know enough about svn's  
internals to know exactly how it'd work.

You could try adding this to the print_scripts

if ( user_can_richedit() )
                wp_enqueue_script('editor');

and then try something like

<?php the_editor($myContent); ?>

while i haven't tried it for widget it works for custom admin pages.

Friends of WP

I'm working on "bulk" loading Content as posts into WP. 
On this way, before loading a couple of hundreds posts by using
"wp_insert_post" I'm calling "wp_delete_post" to delete all 
post_typ='post'.

this all works fine - but I'm not getting the "term" relationships updated 
or deletet. In fact, 
after calling wp_delete_post the term_relationship and term counts are 
"not" updated.

example: before deleting i.e. 33 posts within catgeory_id = 5  the 
term_taxonomy-count tells me: I have 33 posts in this cat.
now I call wp_delete_post and I still have 33 posts in 
term_taxonomy-count. mmmh -> why?

How do I get this updated? Thx for any idea.

I don't know if that one is new but take a look at:

http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.1/

which will return the current version in the 3rd line.
Just if this is any help  for anyone...

I would like to see a "stable"-Tag or "stable"-Branch too.
Even if this is a second line one would need to write....
Wouldn't be comlex to setup some shellscript to do it with only one call

Pfft, I thought, "Hey!, Why not just setup a external page which redirects  
SVN to the correct tag/branch"

<?php
$info =  
file_get_contents('http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.1/');

$info = explode("\n", $info);
$version = $info[2];

header("Location: http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/$version");
?>

..You'd think that'd work, but as it turns out, SVN cant actually handle  
301/302 redirections..

yep it can not handle them...
I tried to map everything inside there (even the headers) but that doesn't
help by any means because apache will not respond to PROPFIND and stuff...
Here is how I extended to script:
<?php
$info = file_get_contents('http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.1/'
);

$info = explode("\n", $info);
$version = $info[2];

$file = str_replace('wp-stable','',$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
foreach(get_headers("http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/$version/$file")
as $header)
    header($header);
echo file_get_contents("
http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/$version/$file");
?>

Anybody any ideas how to make apache just let me map everything?
I wouldn't matter to map all this cause what needs to be accessed would need
to be transfered anyway... so it wouldn't create much overhead if you run it
on localhost...

Another solution could just be a SVN branch/repo that has a "svn switch"
cron run on it daily (or whatever) of the latest tag.

I hate to say it, but this entire thread is really much ado about nothing.
It's not that much work to use svn switch and it's not that bad to run off
of the branch - heck, I've been running off of trunk for the past two years
and only encountered issues twice.

Just my two cents,

Yes, it's easy if you're running a single blog.

However, if you're running dozens, it becomes harder. Plus, being able to
have them updated via a weekly cron for example makes life easy.

FWIW here's the bash script I was using on my last host:
http://pastebin.com/f5038a59c

Just name the file something then append the version number as an argument,
just like Daniel's example above.  You can add as many blog paths as you
like.  I'm not using that on my new host, but it's essentially the same
method, I'm just using a CLI PHP script that crabs a list of blogs to
upgrade from a database table.

Ok let's take this from a different angle.

The problem here is that 2.5.x development is taking place inside
/branches/2.5 while 2.6 is in /trunk.

Really, 2.5.x development should be moved from /branches/2.5 to
another location so /branches/2.5 acts just as /branches/2.3 and /2.2
and /2.1 does.

How were updates to 2.3 being handled while 2.5 development was in
trunk? That's the model that needs to be mirrored here AFAICS.

You're thinking branches are tags. They aren't. Branches are just that --
branches. /branches/2.5 contains the latest alpha code in the 2.5 branch
(2.5.2 alpha currently which is just bugfixes and other things backported
from 2.6) and /trunk/ contains new features and such (2.6 alpha).

When 2.3 was still around, new bugfixes and such were committed to
/branches/2.3 and eventually became 2.3.3 while patches for 2.4 which became
2.5 were committed to /trunk/.

It's correct how it is.

By being commited to /branches/2.3 just as is happening at current with 2.5

If you look through the commit log, You'll see that /branches/2.3/ allways  
contained the latest dev code for that branch, /brances/2.3 was never  
"latest stable" mearly the code which would be used for the next 2.3.x  
release.
http://trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/2.3

Changes have been made against /trunk/ and if tested OK, then backported  
into the /branches/2.5/ branch, just as has been done in the past.

The only code on svn that is *Allways* the same, is what resides inside  
the /tags/ folder, nothing once tagged should change, /branches/*/  
contains the latest code for that branch, And /trunk/ contains the latest  
code which will have bugs (/branches/*/ will also have bugs most likely as  
well)


Looking back over the commit logs, /branches/ has allways been latest code  
for a set branch, its never been static between builds, So i'm not sure  
where the original suggestion that /branches/2.3/ or /branches/2.2/ were  
constantly stable.

I work with several other projects that use Subversion and I think my
mind is confusing them. I honestly thought /branches/xx always
contained the latest stable release. I stand corrected!

What I would ideally like is a place the latest stable release in a
particular branch can be chcked out from, up to and including the
current branch. This allows a blog to run on the latest stable
release, but also allows you control in that a blog will stay on a
particular branch until such time you want to switch it to a brand new
branch release (in the case of 2.3 -> 2.5, it means you can
update/test plugins and themes before doing so).

It may go against the prinicple of tags but could 2.5.x trunk
development be put into something like /tags/2.5-trunk and leave
stable releases in /branches/2.5 ?

Huuuge -1 to that.

+1 to a /branches/stable/ though or equiv.

I think that the branch is already doing what you want. I think the 
confusion here is that in a release branch, 'alpha' doesn't necessarily 
refer to the stability of the code, as it does in trunk. In trunk, the 
'alpha', 'beta', and 'RC' designations have their traditional meanings 
that we normally think of in development. But in a branch the WP 
tradition has mainly been to stick to 'safe' changes. So you can think 
of the 'alpha', 'beta', and 'RC' designations more of a "how soon will 
it become a bugfix release" sort of thing.

Here's how I would describe things, as I see it, based on what we've 
seen since the original switch from cvs to svn, and the later commitment 
to a release schedule:

trunk: Active experimental development for a future 'major' release. 
Expect breakage. alpha -> beta -> RC -> Release (copied to tags/X.Y and 
branches/X.Y) -> alpha++

tags/X.Y[.Z]: The official release snapshots. Fixed in time, never updated.

branches/X.Y: Active bugfix work, and possibly minor new features occurs 
in the newest branch. No API breakage should occur here, unless 
absolutely necessary to fix a major bug. At various points, there may be 
new point releases created from here, by copying to tags/X.Y.Z

That's my opinion/observation, anyhow. I consider the current branch to 
be 'stable', regardless of any alpha/beta designation. One of the 
official commit people can feel free to correct me if I'm speaking out 
of turn about the safety factor in the latest branch.

Now, as to whether there should be some sort of universal svn 'stable' 
pointer that always points to the latest-and-greatest bugfix branch...? 
I don't know. I can see how it could be useful for some people, but I 
think that upgrading between major releases should be a conscious step. 
Automating bugfix updates within a branch is fine. But doing an svn 
switch to a new release every few months isn't that big of a version. 
And it *can* be scripted, with just a little bit of work.

I think version 1.1 of the version-check URL is new.  Either way,  
happy to see it, getting the third line is easy enough.

The branch data would be handy as well, even if it was just part of a  
1.2 version for version-check that included the branch data on the  
4th line.

Except that you will always get the latest Akismet, or any other
external reference.

In other words, you cannot recreate a release by checking out
its /tags/ folder.  You need the zip or tar.gz file for that.

True.  We could pin our externals - the only one we have is akismet.

And we probably should.  But then akismit doesn't have any tags to pin
it too so we would have to pin it to a revision instead which is
possible but harder to maintain.

Not to mention that AFAIK, anything committed to the Akismet SVN folder is
stable code (i.e. bugfixes), so it's best to keep up to date with that.

I thought /tags/2.5 is the 2.5 release - outdated since 2.5.1 was released.
The branches/2.1 to 2.3 hold the latest release because developement on them
was finished with the next 2.x version.

Wasn't the question about a latest-stable-release tag/branch?
Me == confused ;-)

Since I have my personal (v)server since yesterday I'll use the branches/2.5
for my blog - it will be fairly stable at any time I think... since up to my
knowledge there are only backports from 2.6-bleeding and security stuff
which will be added...

When the major update to 2.6 is on I will have to switch branches but since
there will be major changes then I wouldn't want it to switch automatic
anyway. If I would have to maintain more than 3 or 4 blogs and would be
annoyed by having to switch manually I'd write myselfe a script to do so and
use tags instead of branches... think it would be the work of ~15 minutes at
max...

No, there really is not in this case. The user should never be
configuring plugin settings in the first place. The blog's owner is
the one doing that sort of thing.

We're talking about initial or one-time configuration, not something
that you "Manage" every day.

Yes, yes, fine, and that makes perfect sense for plugins that do more
than something behind the scenes or which have more than one page of
configuration. 90% of the plugins out there that have a config page
only have one. They don't have a lot of interface, generally speaking.

The reason for plugins having the ability to add pages essentially
anywhere is that you can always come up with some particular plugin
that will need that ability.

But consider the majority of cases. Plugin with one configuration
page. Setting it up is probably something done one-time. Putting it
into the settings menu is confusing to that initial setup phase,
because you have to activate it and then go elsewhere to configure it.
Activating it and then instantly seeing the resulting page in the menu
is way easier, and it's the right thing to do.

No, that's not at all what I'm saying. I'm saying that usage is
all-important. That's exactly why putting your plugin's settings under
the plugins menu is the right way to do it. Because you're usually
never going to change those settings ever again. There's rarely any
need to do so.

Obviously specific cases vary, but having every plugin stick something
into "Settings" simply makes the menu confusing. Most plugins need
some sort of configuration, but damn few need to be reconfigured every
so often.

You are only speaking about "use once and forget" pages - and what you
describe is the perfectly wrong thing to do even if it sounds right. Why?
Imagine I write a plugin which really is for handling plugins. The admin
has... lets say 10 Plugins installed and every single one puts in its own
settings page at plugins menu. The admin would need to seek trough 10
different one-time-settings-pages to find the page which would really do
something with their plugins.

They should be accessable right out of the plugins description text (or at
least somewhere near that) and shouldn't take any menu item at all... but
AFAIK there is no way to do that today. Perfect way would be:
a) Press install
b) come to config page - configure and save
c) come back to plugin page - maybe start at a) again...
d) if you ever want to change something again go to the plugins page and
scroll down to the plugin click on a link and be back at that config page.

One should ONLY out one time config stuff there - of course.

I have a user who would like to have 2 e-mail addresses associated with

address it?  A quixk Google search didn't yield anything meaningful.

 

Thanks,

Use an email forwarder, set the user to that, and have it forward to  
two email addresses. Though this may complicate 'forgot password'  
action if they don't set this up themselves.

And the *name* of the pages gives them no clues? I mean, I would not
expect "Akismet Configuration" or "Timezone Configuration" to be about
anything other than those plugins...

That is reasonable, and it's possible for a plugin to do that, I
think. Change the redirect after the plugin activation to point to
your own configuration page. However, I think such a method is
confusing, because it breaks from all other plugins. When you activate
a plugin, the sequence should not vary from the expected "plugin
activated" screen. Having simply a new menu item appear draws the eye
to that area visually and implies a next logical step. No need to be
explicit about it.

> Besides: Blogsettings wont change very often too.

Not at all. Stuff in the settings menu generally changes way more
often than plugin settings will. Which is my main concern, of course.
I think that the "Plugins" menu should be reserved for "rarely
visited" pages, although I cannot draw a specific line in the sand as
to what qualifies where. It may be appropriate for a plugin to create
a "Settings" subpage, but more often than not, I do not think that it
is, even though most plugins put their pages there.

I can't help thinking that your use of 'configuration' in your example
proves a point against you. A page like "Plugins > Akismet
Configuration" really could live at "Settings > Akismet" more
logically, and it would take a lot less 'akismet's than 'akismet
configuration's to fill up the horizontal space.

FWIW, in my experience the settings page isn't overloaded by plugin
configuration pages, it's overloaded by stupid plugins that put their
'manage' and/or 'write' pages into the settings (DDFM is one that is
particularly nightmarish for example).

FWIW, my opinion on this matter, is that there needs to be a "style"
guideline written up for plugins. But here is my opinion.

Settings Menu Pages: Plugins with setting pages, that may need to be changed.

Plug-in Menu Pages: Pages that are a one-time configuration.

Main Menu Pages: Pages that are features used often. e.g. File Manager, Podpress

Write Menu Mages: Pages that add content to wordpress.

Manage Menu Pages: Pages the manage content that was addend by the last.

This seems like a very logical method, that I think kind of sums up what
*most* people have been saying on this topic. I suggest adding this to the

This pretty much sums it up for me. As Jennifer pointed out, the codex  
does have some guidance like this:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus but is not as  
clear as this. If or when the codex is updated, I think that the names  
of actual plugins should be avoided, so as not to create a dependancy  
on a particular plugin always being around and/or known by the  
developer community.

- e

P.S. - Does the codex require a different login than say the forums on  
wordpress.org?

You can output the JS inside your widget or just always output it in the
header regardless.

But to actually see if your widget is in use, call wp_get_sidebars_widgets()
and then loop through each array looking for your widget.

Hi,
I was wondering what the purpose of line 285 in wp-settings is The comments
above it say "Should be exactly the same as the default value of SECRET_KEY
in wp-config-sample.php @since 2.5"
Is this deprecated? The comment makes it sound like I'm supposed to be
changing that as well as the constant in wp-config.php

Thanks.

By having the default secret key value stored in the
$wp_default_secret_key variable, WordPress can check whether someone
is using the default key by seeing if $wp_default_secret_key and
SECRET_KEY are identical.   So you don't need to do anything with
$wp_default_secret_key.

Gotcha... I guess the keyword I wasn't paying attention to was DEFAULT in
"Should be exactly the same as the default value of SECRET_KEY"

Thanks.

Well codex maybe is not as clear as this - but it is very clear about one
point:

Plugins<http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Plugins_-_Add_Functionality_to_your_Blog>
> Displays controls dealing with *plugin management, not configuration*options for a plugin itself.


I think we should stick to this - one shouldn't start changing the way
something should be done - this would just end up in a bigger chaos.

Yes the name may identify what it does. But you will have to read it first
to know what its about, which takes time and there is a very clear
difference between reading 10 headings and reading 3.

That is reasonable, and it's possible for a plugin to do that, I

No it isn't possible AFAIK since the main part of what I thoguht about is :
*Do not generate any menu-items at all for one-time-config and do only put a
link inside the plugin-table.
*If your really think it is possible please be so pleasant to give me some
information about how to add a page to the backend without making it appear
inside the navigational structure... There may be workarounds with only
adding it at special times while I am not convinced this would really work.*
*
This would kill most of what was discussed since nobody wants one-time-stuff
to make any menu unusable -  not the settings one and not the plugins one
(well - there seem to be people who disagree with what I think: There may be
plugins which add something which is usable for managing plugins and those
should have a clean menu as well as the settings, management,... plugins)

Hello all --

Per user DD32 on Trac, you can add things to the "Action" column of a  
plugin on the Plugins page.

This would be an excellent way to add links to one-time setup config  
pages for plugins.  Adds _nothing_ to the menus, and thus we can avoid  
clutter.

<http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/5660>
Screenshot:
<http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/5660/example.png>

What we really *should* do before this becomes any kind of common  
practice is to __standardize__ it, so that it is done the same on  
different plugins.  Let's try to avoid having various plugins using  
"Setup", "Settings", "Config", "Configuration", "Configure" etc. ad  
nauseum

My suggestion for standard "Action" links for plugins:

Configure -- for one-time setup -- linked page DOES NOT appear  
elsewhere in Admin

Settings -- links to Settings pages that DO appear elsewhere in  
Admin.  Use this to avoid people not being able to find where you  
tucked it....

Uninstall -- Removes preferences, extra tables, etc from database.   
Completely remove plugin.

And of course, not going anywhere, is the standard:
Activate/Deactivate

Cool ;-)
Thats just perfectly what I was thinking about and exactly what

while I would be perfectly fine with both - why don't call it what it is -
Setup.

I disagree there, The page should be accessable via menu's as is currently  
possible, which in my mind, is the only time a page should ever appear on  
the plugins page.
"Configuring" is the process of modfying settings, Whether they be initial  
once-set, or changed weekly. Maybe a better word would be "Setup"

Settings fits in good with the rest of the admin, I would expect it to  
have added a page in the settings menu.

Note: All plugins should remove any non-user-settings such as caches/etc  
on plugin deactivation, Or at least set autoload = 'no' on any of their  
bulky options.

Sounds great to me overall.

I'd also like to suggest:
Manage -- links to a subpage of the Manage tab

I definitely think there are cases where there is no need for an item  
in the menus.  So many plugins do one small thing, and are set-and- 
forget, that people can end up with a huge number of things on the  
menus -- half of which they don't need.  I have about 20 plugins on my  
blog.  I've heard people on this list say they have 50 or more!

I think the best approach for that type of thing (Akismet being a bee- 
yoo-tiful example) is to have a Setup link on the plugins page.  We  
might even alter the "Plugin Activated" blurb that appears to add  
"Click on the 'Setup' link below to configure it", or add the link  
directly to the "activated blurb.  Another option to consider is to go  
straight to the setup upon activation (???)

Oh, and... semantically I agree completely with "Setup" for the one- 
time stuff.  I was trying to distinguish clearly from "Settings", but  
y'all are correct.

Another thought -- not sure how to do this -- we might automate this  
so that any time a plugin adds a page in the Admin menu, this link is  
automatically added to the Plugins Page.  Advantages:

1) The links will be added to already existing plugins with no changes  
needed
2) This will help enforce the link name consistency
3) The easier for Plugin authors the better

Separately, we might add a dedicated function such as  
add_uninstall_link() to which authors can attach an uninstall function.

So... We're looking at:

New function:  add_setup_link()
* Attach a setup page that is linked with a "Setup" link on the  
Plugins page.
* Link does NOT appear under any Admin menu.

New function: add_uninstall_link()
* Attach an uninstall function that is linked with an "Uninstall" link  
on the Plugins page.
* Confirmation should be built-in to avoid problems with accidental  
clicks.
* Include parameter to manually repress the confirmation so an author  
can remove OR customize it (default is to show confirmation).

Modified function: add_submenu_page() (and related functions)
* When Pages are added to Admin menu, direct link is added to Action  
column of plugin creating that link.
* Add parameter to specify the link title.  Default is "Settings".   
Should be localised.
	- Exception: Pages under "Manage" menu default to "Manage".  Should  
be localised.
* Add parameter to manually repress link in case an author does NOT  
want it to appear (default is to make the link).

Modified function: (don't know the function)
* On plugin activation, if add_setup_link() is called, add "Setup"  
link to the "Plugin Activated" blurb at top of plugins page.
* On plugin activation, if add_submenu_page() is called, add "Go to  
<Settings> page" link to the "Plugin Activated" blurb at top of  
plugins page.

What think ye?

Stephen

why would someone want any menu items which will never be used a second
time? Just think about akismet - why give it any room in you menu? You go
there once to add your API Key - there is no reason why you would want to go
there again... if you really want to go there some years later you could
easily click on the link in the plugins table...

Very slick. Didn't know about that. I'll change my Timezone plugin to
use that approach, as a full blown menu for one setting is somewhat
unnecessary.

I'm writing plugin (wp-deleteplugin) that uses jQuery to add the Delete
action link to the Plugins page:

function ps_deleteplugin_jquery() {
  $link =
"plugins.php?action=delete&amp;page=wp-deleteplugin/wp-deleteplugin.php&amp;
plugin=";
  ?>
  <script type='text/javascript'>
  /**
  * @desc Add Delete Plugin link
  * @author Per Soderlind - www.soderlind.no";
  */
  jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('#plugins
td.togl').filter(':contains(Activate)').each(function(i,el) {
      var strHref = jQuery( this ).find('a')[0].toString();
      var returnVal = new Array();
      var qString = null;
      var strQueryString = strHref.split("?");
      qString = strQueryString[1].split("&");
      for (var i=0;i<qString.length; i++){
        if (escape(unescape(qString[i].split("=")[0])) == "plugin") {
          returnVal.push(qString[i].split("=")[1]);
        }
      }

      if (returnVal.length==0) plugin = null;
      else if (returnVal.length==1) plugin = returnVal[0];
      else plugin = returnVal;

      jQuery( this ).append(" | <a href=\"<?php echo $link;?>" + plugin +"\"
title=\"Delete this plugin\" class=\"edit\">Delete</a>");
    });
  });
  </script>
  <?php
}

if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'plugins.php') !== false) {
  add_action('admin_head', array(&$this, 'ps_deleteplugin_jquery'));
}

That depends on JavaScript, does it not?

Fine for a plugin, but a core function should probably be PHP.

I agree 100%, but as long as it's not in the core (and patching core isn't
an option), I'm using jQuery (which is included with WP :)

I will break this into a couple pieces and put them on Trac (as  
separate tickets).  Some I think I can handle, some may be beyond me.

I think the setup and uninstall links are one ticket, add_submenu_page  
mod is another.

But for alphabetical ways, not just numbered format? Sometimes I create

1.

2.

3.

Thanks! Wow, that was simple... LOL! Just wondering though, wouldn't 
that be like such in the css file then right:

.entry-content ol li {list-style-type:none;}
.entry-content ol ol li { list-style-type: lower-alpha; }

If you want the main numbered ordered list to be normal number output as 
such:

<ol>
<li> stuff here </li>
<li> stuff here </li>
<li> stuff here </li>
<ol>
<li> stuff here under last li above </li>
<li> stuff here under last li above </li>
<li> stuff here under last li above </li>
</ol>
</ol>

Output:
 1. stuff here
 2. stuff here
 3. stuff here
   a. stuff here under last li above
   b. stuff here under last li above
   c. stuff here under last li above

Sorry, I'm not a total CSS professional yet... so.. bare with me here LOL!

Well, actually mine is this:

.entry-content ol li {
        margin:0 1.5em 0 1.5em;
        padding:5px;
        }

.entry-content ol ol li {
        list-style-type: lower-alpha;
        margin:0 1.5em 0 1.5em;
        padding:5px;
        }

The last example I sent, the "none" shouldn't be in there at all for 
first one.

<ol>
<li> stuff here </li>
<li> stuff here </li>
<li> stuff here </li>
<ol>
<li> stuff here under last li above </li>
<li> stuff here under last li above </li>
<li> stuff here under last li above </li>
</ol>
</ol>

Output:
1. stuff here
2. stuff here
3. stuff here
  a. stuff here under last li above
  b. stuff here under last li above
  c. stuff here under last li above

Everything is working good! =D Thanks again Alan. I just wasn't sure 
about the css "code" for doing it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Inline Documentation Effort was a Failure
Message-ID: <4834EB6A.8020402@santosj.name>

Hmm, it seemed four months away from the effort has given me insight 
into my inquiry on whether the effort would actually be an success. A 
successful condition would be active inline documentation maintenance, 
which means active support of updating current inline documentation and 
when adding new functions, making sure that they also have inline 
documentation (phpdoc).

I do think it is frustrating, I was going to go ahead and restart the 
effort, but updating my repository depressed me. The assumption was that 
one person wouldn't have to continuous keep on top of the documentation 
to make sure it was accurate and add documentation for new functions. 
The attempt was to get others to accept ownership and slowly work 
together to improve the inline documentation.

Reasons The Effort Failed (in my humble opinion):

1. Writing Documentation sucks

Writing user and developer documentation sucks. Writing Inline 
Documentation sucks. As professionals, you have to do what needs to be 
done to provide quality support to the users and developers that come 
after you. Writing documentation might be akin to the 9th circle of 
hell, but knowing that the person that comes after can make it into 
heaven should be all the more worthwhile. Writing documentation isn't 
about you, it is about the next guy who has to read your (ugly) code.

2. Doesn't help when the project leader doesn't see the importance.

I had a conversation with Matt Mullenweg,

"Why doesn't the Shortcodes have documentation?" I asked.

"What do you mean? It does have documentation. Check the codex." Matt 
replied.

Yeah the first place I'm going to look for function documentation is on 
the web. No. The first place I'm going to look is in the code! That 
aside the documentation for the shortcodes in the codex is very good, 
but it is the exception rather than the rule.

3. You can't have majority of the core developers not adding inline 
documentation.

Peter Westwood appears to be the lone core developer, which consistency 
adds inline documentation. I say this from my experience with his 
commits from October 2007 to January 2008. So I'm going to apply my 
assumption based on historical evidence rather than current evidence.

The inline documentation effort is headed for failure unless all of the 
core developers understand that inline documentation is not only 
important, but required. Without it, you have a situation, where some of 
the code has inline documentation and most doesn't. Eventually you'll 
get to a point where most of the inline documentation is either in need 
of updates or most of the functions are in need of phpdoc documentation.

That said, even if all of the functions were documented today, what 
would the situation be two months or two years from now? Pretty terrible.

4. Need better support from the community.

I restarted the effort to keep from having the conversation about adding 
inline documentation and nothing coming from it. I did not ever plan on 
having to maintain the inline documentation and I did not plan on having 
to constantly keep on top of new functions being added.

You can't force anyone to do anything in an open source community. 
Enough people do great things that I doubt inline documentation is a 
major boon or thorn to anyone. Depressing, but I'll rather be coding 
myself thank you.

5. Need rule making it a requirement for patches and for core developers.

I mean, this is implied with 2 and 3, but I came from a project where 
you had to write both inline documentation and DocBook documentation. It 
was a pain in the ass, but at the end of the day, it was worth it, 
because everyone knew what the code was supposed to do.

WordPress didn't become popular, because of inline documentation nor 
will it increase or decrease in popularity, because of it. I just doubt 
that my effort and mission.

If you disagree, then by all means, please take up the effort and prove 
me wrong. Hell, I'll even help prove myself wrong if you will start. If 
no one else does then I'll reconsider the effort for the Fall.

Message-ID: <8f93a7390805212056q2e2a5156m85bd7f9d2d3e8f5a@mail.gmail.com>

This is kinda RE: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6444   but I thought I'd
take the discussion up here rather than re-open the ticket or make a new
one.


I'm (attempting) to write a shortcode-powered code posting plugin. You type
like [code lang="php"]some code here[/code] and it htmlspecialchar()'s it
and other things.

The problem I'm running into though is both wpautop() and wptexturize() are
both ruining the internals of my shortcodes by either formatting them or
adding paragraph marks where I have mutli-line code posts.

So I can think of three solutions:


1. wpautop() and wptexturize() get modified to not touch the internals of
valid shortcodes. I have tickets open for this (
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6984 &
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6969 ) but I don't know how those will pan
out or if it's even the best solution.

2. Bring back the before/after-10 code. This is also probably not the best
solution as it's ugly and adds tons of excess code.

3. I hook in pre-10 with my own filter, hack the $shortcode_tags global so
it only contains my shortcodes, apply do_shortcodes() to the $content, and
then put $shortcode_tags back to what it was. My shortcode processing
functions will need to replace the code blocks with placeholders that'll
survive wpautop() and wptexturize() and then at level 11, I replace my
placeholders with the real HTML I want. Ugh.


Any thoughts / suggestions on this whole ordeal?

I agree with everything you said. Just curious, doesn't all this 
documentation to each PHP file, only had more bulk/ size per file too? 
So, instead of having a normal 2kb sized file, after documentation was 
added, it might be 3 or 4kb?

IMHO, from what you were just saying... either everyone needs to get 
together to make this stuff happen ... or, just forget about it all 
together (and or remove what's there). No sense keeping documentation 
that's already in there, if no one would be willing to update that 
current stuff...?

Or, you could always just leave in what's currently there and update 
that when needed, and then just forget about doing (anymore) "newer" 
documentation(s)... It sounds like currently the Cons are in the lead, 
even though the Pros should already be at the finish line... and this 
frustrates you... I feel ya man... I know how it is, it SUCKS. =(

Developers are lazy people in general, If something does not give them a  
benefit in the imminent future, chances are, its not likely to be taken.

Developers like Clean code, Clean code is usually relitivly easy for a  
developer to read, I personally have not been involved in WordPress for a  
long time, But i can look at a function name, and its arguements, and have  
a pretty good idea of what it takes in, and what its likely to return.
Those new to WordPress, or who do not understand the inner workings,  
Cannot make assumptions like that.

Inline Documentation is a great thing, It documents functionality, It  
paves the way for future developers to understand what they're looking at,  
It adds extra time to the coding process.
I cant count the number of times i've come accrossa bug in some software,  
And then spent hours attempting to figure out what the heck is going on,  
After working for a few hours, I'm likely to throw a comment here, maybe  
one there, But i'm unlikely to want to write up a paragraph of notes on  
the exact function or nature of a function.

Developers do not generally have a English Degree, I personally only speak  
English, I barely understand any other language, But give me a programming  
language and it'll be easy. I find documentation hard to write, Its not  
only the phrasing, But keeping it concise and to the point, while being  
readable to other people.
Swing back to the first point, Developers are lazy, I could spend some  
time in learninghow to write good documentation, Infact, I *should* do so,  
However, I have not yet been forced to, Or had a huge need to.

I personally know how hard it is to go through an make lots of changes to  
code, knowing that had people been a bi more careful while making changes,  
they could've ended up with cleaner code.
I mean, Just look at all the extra variable references i striped out:  
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5418 Most were left over from when API  
was added, or another function deprecated. Quite a lot of the code was  
still there, simply as it didnt affect the running of WordPress (Other  
than taking up a few ms).


Not all Developers are Lazy, Some have English Degrees, Some do not speak  
English Fluently, Some enjoy making large sweeping changes, And even those  
in worse positions than me, Can Write good inline documentation(Or not so  
good even, But they still try, and get the point accross).

Inline documentation is great, It helps everyone, But keeping it updated  
is another matter, Most coders enjoy the coding, Not the writing. Most of  
the patches submitted to trac do not include Documentation either, Quite  
often, A diff is commmited directly without too much editing by the look,  
Nothing against the commiter, But fact is, Those who do the commits do not  
allways have the time to add extra documentation, The patch submitter is  
most likely just wanting to fix the bug rather than explain what the code  
does.


I'm aiming to add documentation to any new functions, or any code which is  
not self explanitory which I myself write, Simply because, My logic can be  
weird at the best of times, I dont trust others to know what *my* mind is  
thinking.

And while i'm on it, Great thanks to mdawaffe for the documentation on the  
Revisions, Was much easier to understand how the Revisions were being  
handled with the commenting in the code:  
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7747

I know some people are not going to agree 100% with this post, But i also  
know some people will not agree with the parent post either,  
"Documentation is bloat, it jsut increases the code size!", etc.

(For reference: Yes, Documentation probably adds a fair few KB to each  
file, most of hte diffs i saw were in the area of 20+KB, But PHP is  
efficient at ignoring comments, The only real extra delay is loading from  
the filesystem, And if and extra bit of code loading time really makes too  
much of a difference to performance, Your server needs to look into an  
opcache solution)

Jacob, The documentation wasnt a waste of your time at all, Thank you for  
all the docs, Really, Thank you, It'll be a shame if its the only real  
documentation in the code, But i'm sure many people have allready been  
helped by it.
As to writing more, If you do, Great for you :), If you dont, Then i dont  
blame you. In order to continue you need support, And if theres no support  
there from major devs, then you dont get very far.

My opinion:
wpautop/wptexturize should ignore the content of shortcodes, and allow the  
shortcode handler to take care of all outputted formatting.

Else how is the shortcode handler supposed to get the data that the user  
has supplied it?
If i supply a shortcode:
[shortcode]
Some text

Some Text
[/shortcode]
I want that exact code to be passed along
The same goes for if it contains special characters, HTML, or anything  
else i can think of.

I think some trust needs to be given to a plugin if its chose to output  
some HTML, its not allways WordPress's place to stand in and dictate how  
it should speak(the html it outputs).

Yes, another shortcode thread.

I'm throwing together a shortcode-powered BBCode plugin ([b], [i], etc.).
BBCode can be both inline and block level and I need it to be properly
wrapped in <p>'s and such. Is there any way to know when I need to call
wpautop() on my content string within the shortcode?


Code examples:


This is some [b]bolded text[/b].

[b]This whole paragraph is bold.[/b]

I can get frustrated checking out bug reports that relate to an
undocumented or uncommented function. From a quick look at the function
you can usually get an idea of the concept of the function but the bug
almost always lies in the subtleties of the function. Is it a bug? Did
the author intend it to work that way, if so, what depends on that behavior.

I'm just as guilty of it myself
(http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6842#comment:12) where I should have
at least left a comment as to why I'd not replaced the key generation
code with wp_generate_password() despite the key generation and password
generation being identical at that stage. I'll learn next time :-)

I believe this might be because many of the core developers do not use
a full fledged IDE for developing PHP code. This is just a guess on my
part, but a lot of the people I know who edit PHP use editors that are
essentially little more than text editors with syntax coloring.

I've recently starting using the Eclipse PDT for editing and creating
PHP projects, and find that use of full out IDEs like this makes it
not only much easier to add inline documentation, but it gives you a
valid reason to do so as well. When looking at code, having the
ability to simply put the cursor over a function call and see that
documentation pop up in a biggish tooltip is extremely handy and kind
of makes you want to document your own functions correctly.

Perhaps if the devs try using some of these sort of IDEs, some
progress can be made on this front? Having Eclipse PDT with the
Subclipse plugin to pull directly from the SVN is extremely handy and
neat to play with.

I support inline docs by committing others patches and trying to
document new public API as it goes in.  Those who want inline docs
need to step up; I have enough tedious chores on my plate. :-)

I use PDT. It has a very handy feature where it collapses all inline
docs so I don't have to see them. :-)

The doc tooltips are very handy for those who need them, however.  I'm
all for inline docs, I'm just not the audience for them.

The documentation was worth writing.  It makes things like this [1] much
more useful.

We do need to promote and request the submission of inline docs with new
code though.  The best time to write the documentation is when you are
writing the code :-)

Writing documentation along with Code Review are good ways to validate
the code.

+1, Thanks so much Jacob! Documentation is great whenever/wherever we
can get it, you did a great job on the docs for the revised taxonomy
system and it helped immensely. Hopefully we can all take a few
minutes now and then to fill out our favorite functions.

For those of you who use Westi's Xref (to those of you who don't,
start!), I just realized there is a MUCH better link to use than the
default Xref root (which doesn't have links to the functions and has
that silly frame).

http://sandbox.ftwr.co.uk/wp/_functions/index.html

Plain page with a list of all functions and links at the top for
classes, variables etc. The 'show explorer' link at the top displays
the frame with the file browser sidebar if you need it.

Happy hacking,

Yeah, the functions list is the only reason I use xref. Insanely handy.

I've recently starting using the Eclipse PDT for editing and creating
PHP projects, and find that use of full out IDEs like this makes it
not only much easier to add inline documentation, but it gives you a
valid reason to do so as well. When looking at code, having the
ability to simply put the cursor over a function call and see that
documentation pop up in a biggish tooltip is extremely handy and kind
of makes you want to document your own functions correctly.

is this feature available in Zend Studio? I would imagine so, but I'm not
positive.

Perhaps I sounded the failure too soon. To be fair, let me state the
conditions of failure and success to be determined at a later date. I
thought about it at the beginning and these are basically what I had in
mind.

I'm not trying to undermine the current accomplishments. The community and
core team has really turned WordPress into a highly respectable
application. However, there is competition out there and WordPress will be
evaluated months and years from now. If the competition has documentation,
has the same features as WordPress, then I'm going to go with the
competition.

I /do/ actually like WordPress, it does many things right and continues to
do so with 2.6. Regardless, the differences between the different blog
platforms are growing smaller.

Conditions of Success:

* Active maintenance of inline documentation from core and/or community
members. (As shown perviously with pluggable.php, this has already failed)

* Function additions either has inline documentation included or patch
afterwards which adds it (I suppose if I change my mind, this would still
continue to be successful. I meaning without my involvement and right now
it is most not doing it).

* Continued improvement of the inline documentation. (Like DD32 said, I'm
also not an expert at grammar and writing composition. Actually, my
documentation sometimes does quite suck.)

* All core developers writing inline documentation.

* Requirement for patches and the core team that any commit/patch requires
inline documentation updates or additions.


With the last two, I mean before Ohloh removed (or changed the location
of) the statistics for the comment to code ratio, Matt had one of the
lowest for the team. I'm not flaming Matt, but it is just how it is from
the previous statistics and it is a fact (well one that can no longer be
reference, but I did do research back in October, so you can take my word
for it or not. I don't care what you think). Not all of it is his fault,
as I found out, Matt commit the shortcodes, but he wasn't the one who
wrote it. So he does shoulder the blame, for some of which is not actually
his.

When the project leader says, "This is how it is going to be." By his word
that is how it is and either you accept it or you join another project
which does it the way you want. To be honest, I accepted the requirement
to write documentation kicking and screaming on the other project.

I'm pretty sure I thought at the time, that there was no way in hell that
the requirement would ever be added that all patches have inline
documentation, which either adds or updates inline documentation that is
needed. My hope was that it wouldn't matter and if enough of WordPress was
documented that the community would jump in and do the right thing for
WordPress.

I knew that it almost needed a culture shift and saying, "Hey, you get the
ball rolling and we'll join you!" I'm not sure I have the Karma to
influence that in the community.

It seems that I should shoot for more completion before I retreat again in
dispair. It would be nice to finally complete a project I started, unlike
the 10 or so personal coding projects I have sitting and waiting for me
once I finish.

I appreciate the support, but you know the prediction that the inline
documentation will go into disrepair in two years time might never happen.
I'll probably fork WordPress long before that happens.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6444 should have taken care of that,

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7816 should keep autop from

If that's the way it's supposed to happen (and it sounds good if it is),
then it's currently broken in trunk and I believe 2.5.1.

Although it looks to me like those patches more deal with not wrapping the
whole shortcode in a <p> if it stands by itself rather than not messing with
the contents of valid shortcodes, but my regex is rusty.

Urbangiraffe's Redirection plugin kicks butt in these sorts of use cases:

Why would you want to do that? The default behavior of stripping the period
and redirecting to the correct URL is much, much better for SEO and your
readers.

Hey all,

Localization, internationalization and translations have never been
the favourite topic for plugin developers. I know preparing your code
for translation isn't an exciting routine. That's why we offer you
some help to make both your life easier and your international users
happy:

* Generate your POT file from the admin section of your plugin in the
plugin repository at wordpress.org.

* Easily add gettext domain to your __ and _e calls from the same place.

* Read the short arcticle about how to deal with internationalization
and localization as a WordPress developer:

Happy internationalizing,
Nikolay.

Great job, Nikolay!

A central place to translate the plugin would also be nice. Have you
guys considered a Web interface to translate the PO files for the
plugins?

 A couple months ago, I created a pretty simple online PO translation
program:
http://andrewferguson.net/2008/03/21/phpo-translator-online-po-translator/

It's _very_ simple and straight forward and pretty much does just what I
need it to do. But if someone wants to take it and run with it, they should.
I've posted the code at Google Code as GPL'd code:

Interesting, your PHPO tool is enough for most plugins I guess.

But for more complex needs (user access control, multiple po), there are

Pootle (from Sourceforge), http://translate.sourceforge.net/
and entrans (a PHP solution). http://sourceforge.net/projects/entrans

I don't like Pootle too much as I am not familiar with Python and
found it hard to customize.

Can someone name any great (PHP-)IDE's which aren't running on java (but
work on windows)? Open Source would of course be prefered but I don't care
paying for good tools.

Eclipse is a nice IDE but in fact I never got it running very performant and
thats why I don't even considere using an IDE for coding php.
Maybe an IDE which runns fast and without using many resources would make me
change my mind...

I don't have experience with any so I wouldn't be able to help. But there's
Zend Studio, though it *seems* like it's built off of Eclipse. There's also
the option of using Visual Studio 2005/2008 and using the Jcx Vs.PHP plugin.
I'm about to try that myself. Also there is Komodo Edit (Free) and if you
need more features there's a commercial version. Komodo is pretty cool
(intellisense-like features, etc.) and supports PHP, Python, and other
languages I think Ruby and Perl.

Check out the new NetBeans 6.1 - it's the 2nd best IDE ever created, and will most likely blow whatever your currently using away :)

History:

WordPress and bbPress share a good deal of code and it's a huge pain  
keeping everything in sync.  The original idea was to have code that  
both apps drew from (ideally as an svn external to eliminate sync  
issues).

That lead to the idea that perhaps BackPress could be a sort of  
backbone on top of which people could write real applications.  You'd  
get a DB class, user/authentication system, convenience functions,  
sanitation functions, or any subset thereof.  All would be compatible  
with how WordPress works making for better integration/portability  
with other apps in the "family".

Most of the code was lifted straight from WordPress or bbPress.  That  
is to say, most of the code was put into BackPress in such a way as  
to make it easy for bbPress/WordPress to use BackPress.  To date,  
there has not been as much focus on how to make BackPress itself a  
solid piece of code or on how to make BackPress useable by other  
(future or current) real world apps.


Future:

bbPress trunk is running off of BackPress right now, though I don't  
know when the first based-on-BackPress bbPress release will be.   
WordPress just got it's first taste of BackPress in the tweaked  
WP_Scripts and new WP_Styles code.

As one of the main contributors to bbPress, I'd like to see WordPress  
use more of BackPress, not because I think it's good/bad/better/worse  
code, but because it will make my life easier.  That's not the best  
reason to switch WordPress to BackPress, especially if people think  
the code is terrible.  If we did make the switch, though, there'd be  
a lot more attention and eyes or BackPress to make it better.

It will take a significant but not unrealistic amount of work to get  
WordPress using BackPress.  Having two apps using BackPress would  
also show us better where integration issues arise.

To have any substantial future, BackPress needs a thorough beating by  
people like yourself. Additionally, it's never been used to build a  
new app, only to consolidate code between two existing apps, so it's  
hard to say if it worth its salt in its current state or what, if  
anything (and I'm sure there are many anythings), needs to change in  
order to get it to a useful state.

Right now, it's "these are some sacks full of functions".  The only  
advantage BackPress' current classes give over WordPress' current  
code is better portability between apps (and the ability to do some  
small extensions on top of them).  Most of the classes are meant to  
be instantiated once ever; really they're there for "namespacing"  
purposes.

In the end, I don't much care if the code is pretty or ugly or  
whatever, as long as it's useful.  I'm not by any means making the  
claim that it's currently useful :).  I can say that it functions  
(though again note the limited scope in which it's been used so far).

As does BackPress, your critiques suffer from over abstraction.  Can  
you point to specific examples that give you the "It sucks!" reaction?

BackPress no doubt suffers from over abstraction, under abstraction,  
just plain bad abstraction, and any other name for "bad code" you can  
come up with.  It also suffers from a major lack of documentation  
(though, as you note, it's early).

I'd really value your input and, in particular, any contributions you  
want to make.  We can start a new mailing list for discussion, if  
that'd make things easier.  I also just realized that the trac  
instance for BackPress requires authentication for anyone to even  
view it.  Lame.  I'll open that up so things are more transparent.

Cool, but he said he didn't want one that runs on Java, my guess is that one
does.

Just curious - would love to beat on backpress. Is there even a development
branch of backpress that can be downloaded? SVN?

Hmm well yes I said it - but I think I will give it a try - if it runs
performantly it may be ok for me... I'm not against java itselfe but eclipse
and some online banking software and some other stuff build in java where /
are damn slow... I can live with that on online banking as long as it works
but I can not live with it when coding - and eclipse is the best example of
software which takes more time than it gives you in return...

I will forst of all try komodo [open source first - if it really satisfies
me with what it offers (starting at performance) I may go commercial ;-) ] -
then netbeans...

While I don't think any of them will "blow whatever [I am] currently using
away" because e is perfectly performant and usable for nearly everything -
so I might switch for some tasks but definitly not for all ;-)

Thanks
Alex

Oops - forgot :)

Both are publicly readable.  You'll need to log into trac with your

Well, it is clear that would be the case. That it is to share code between
bbPress and WordPress and that classes were used as namespaces.

I think that is one of the problems is that you are asking the question
what can we share between the two and add to enhance the foundation. The
questions you should be asking are as follows:

What problems are within WordPress which warrant redesign?
(Controller-Model-View refactor, WPDB, Plugins, Pluggables)

What design elements is right within WordPress? (Plugins, Themes, simple
to use functions and most classes don't have many external dependencies)

Which parts of WordPress and bbPress can be part of every application?
(User, author template, Authentication, Authorization or capabilities)

Which parts not inside of WordPress and bbPress need to be added, because
they are needed in other applications.

If I wanted to use BackPress to create an application, it would require
major work. If I wanted to use WordPress to create an standalone gallery
what would I need to do? If I wanted to use bbPress to create a standalone
gallery what would I need?

That might be interesting, but if that would happen you would have to
create a new major version to do so.

I can tell you what is crap, but I'm unaware at this stage of my learning
development at what improvements (which wouldn't also be crap) that can be
made. If I were to garner a guess, I would put together a Test Driven
Development unit tests, which go through the objects design to get a
"feel" for what design works and what doesn't.

I like doing that, because eventually, I'm going to learn the better way
with flow charts and class design. As an egg, that is how I would go about
my suggestions.


Well, I lost the rest of my email, but basically, I do have ideas on what
can be improved and would like to work on improving BackPress and
WordPress, because ultimately I do see myself using one or the other for a
few of my upcoming projects.

I'll put something together and keep feedback in mind when I get into the
MVC TDD mode for WordPress and any suggestions.

My personal roadmap for doing this is in the Fall. I'll keep updated on
the progress.

What do you want out of an IDE?

Because if you don't need debugging (i.e. with XDebug) then  
Dreamweaver isn't a bad code editor. The FTP and site management tools  
are actually pretty good. The code coloring and syntax highlighting  
are very useable, and its code completion (of inbuilt functions - not  
custom code), is not full featured, but is helpful. Download a trial  
you may like it.

If you tastes in IDE is more sophisticated, then you need to get more  
ram or a better JVM. Eclipse + PDT (and Zend Studio for Eclipse) are  
your only other hopes. Or get a mac and use textmate, the best little  
cod editor I've ever used, (though I still use eclipse to debug).

I like the idea, but until wordpress has actually been refactored as a  
"built-off-BackPress" app, then it won't really be that useful to the  
general audience. In fact what you've just described is the invention  
of a framework of sorts that builds off the best of the 'common'  
elements of WP and bbP, but I don't know if PHP needs another framework.

In fact, wouldn't it make more sense just to integrate bbPress as a  
wordpress plugin? Seems like it could inherit everything it needed  
that way pretty easily. I mean, Wordpress already is a pretty strong  
backbone.

There's an application called inType (http://intype.info/home/index.php)

Jacob,

I applaud your efforts to promote writing phpdoc blocks as a matter of  
programming best practice, but there is a good reason why its not  
being done consistently: the developers (most of whom are volunteers)  
have better things to do. Plain and simple.

I am a developer with 12 years of professional programming experience.  
My last two positions have been as tech leads, and I have been  
responsible for crafting the standards for my team. And if there is  
something I have learned from that role: you can't force policies on  
developers if they don't see the value in them. There has to be  
universal buy in from all the developers. The other thing I've learned  
is that you don't have to implement all best practices in order to  
have a successful team/project/code base.

The other thing to keep in mind is that best practices don't look the  
same on every project. In fact, they need to be customized to fit the  
work at hand. Wordpress, both its developers and its fearless leader,  
just happens to prefer documentation living in the Codex instead of  
phpdoc blocks. It gets them more bang for their buck, as more people  
will be using it in their day to day usage than looking at the code.  
I've been building sites and blogs with wordpress since the 1.5 days,  
and have always found the Codex to be more than adequate for my needs.  
In fact I trumpet the wordpress API - as represented by the Codex - as  
the mark of a brilliantly executed open source web app. Sure,  
generated documentation would be helpful to new people looking to  
start committing to the wordpress project, but that's a much smaller  
audience that the people looking to just extend and customize WP for  
their needs. For that group, the codex is just fine, and the WP team  
recognizes that fact. Indeed, this is a primary example of an agile  
development philosophy - and one that resonates with my own  
development methodology. This is obviously a deliberate decision made  
by those stewarding the WP project into the future, and one that works  
fine for 99% of the users.

> I'll probably fork WordPress long before that happens.

Just because the developers aren't writing phpdocs? That seems rather  
stubborn and dogmatic. There are more interesting things to do on the  
project, and any of them will provide more long term value than  
generated documentation. But if you feel that strongly that they  
should be written, then provide a good example, document others code  
when you can, and evangelize the benefits of the practice. But don't  
expect developers to react favorably to coercion and bullying.

I'm not. I do all my coding in what is basically Notepad (EditPlus as it
does pretty colors).

Not bad. 'e' was supposed to be the TextMate on windows, but required  
CYGWIN just to mimic it on some levels, and I found it lacking and  
clunky.

I'll keep my eye on this one for sure. Thanks.

Bingo. It only provides a benefit if you can get one while coding. And  
it can be awesome, but you have to treat it like Writing Unit Tests -  
write the phpdoc blocks first, then code. It helps make you think your  
code though thoroughly.

While I am working with e for some time now and haven't had any problems
with it nor found it to be "lacking and clunky"

What do you want out of an IDE?

Well - to be precise I do not need one. But as Otto mentioned some features
of his IDE which would be nice to have in my coding environment, I thought -
well maybe there is some better coding tool somewhere out there, maybe I
should just ask around.

then you need to get more ram

one should think eclipse should be able to run performant with 2 GB ram...
even with Win XP loaded...

> Or get a mac and use textmate

Some day I will for sure grab a mac - but not today.

What is 'e', do you mean eclipse?

I tend to 'edit' all my cod with a large filleting knife, a cutting

But that's just me.

Subject: [wp-hackers] load-(page) action hook
Message-ID: <5158C57B-0FC9-470A-ACE9-1192F064CF42@xentek.net>

I ran across this in the codex (http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference 
), and would like to use it for a plugin I am developing. If I  
understand it correctly, I can specify the name of the page on which  
to fire my plugin functions, but can't seem to figured out the syntax.

The page I want it to fire on is the users page in the admin screen. I  
tried load-(users) and load-users and neither one fired my plugin. I'm  
using admin_head now for the hook, but this makes it fire on every  
admin page, and is inefficient for my needs.

Any one know how to use the load-(page) action hook?

When in doubt, check the source. :)

The hook is called in /wp-admin/admin.php and for non-plugin pages, the hook
name is "load-filename.php". So for you, it'd be "load-users.php".

The syntax is the same as in admin_print_scripts-(page_hook) or 
admin_print_scripts-(plugin_page). The (page_hook) is returned when you 
call add_management_page(), or you can hard-code it.

The action hook for the users.php page is "load-users.php".

> Any one know how to use the load-(page) action hook?

In general, if you're adding your own admin page, you can figure out
the load action hook from the return value of the function adding the
menu.

For example, the following would call my_load_function() on the
loading of the manage admin page I created:

$my_page = add_management_page(...);
add_action("load-$my_page", 'my_load_function');

I use Zend Studio - it integrates with svn for project/version 
management, has syntax highlighting, catches lots of errors when typing 
(shows missing { }, or un-matched () in if statements etc.
on-line help for any php term, debugging etc. it's good but costs. I 
believe Zend + Eclipse is excellent, but have not tried it yet.
I won't go on, check out the Zend website, it's all there. (Zend are the 
makers of php I believe).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Inline Documentation Effort was a Failure
In-Reply-To: <DAE2D99E-3DF1-4A89-A357-5A7455373ACC@xentek.net>
References: <4834EB6A.8020402@santosj.name>	<2960.12.218.100.83.1211511702.squirrel@webmail.santosj.name>

Message-ID: <48388CC9.2030702@santosj.name>

Forking WordPress is a joke, which I have difficultly explaining well. 
If I forked WordPress, it would quickly fall behind the official 
WordPress feature set, bug fix, and support.

The goal was never to force the issue, because I understood that was 
unachievable. The goal was to put forth a new "toy" and see if the 
criteria listed before would be implemented. What you stated is 
absolutely correct and I already knew that. I'm stating that my personal 
expectations and experiment was a failure and listed the reasons why. 
For future reference for anyone who wishes to take up the effort in the 
future and what the expectations were at this point of time.

The entire Inline Documentation Effort was based on the premise that the 
codex does not have every function and WordPress API documented. I've 
looked at the WordPress Codex and I couldn't find everything I was 
looking for and some of the stuff I did find was out of date.

The Inline Documentation Effort was to document something that is small, 
relatively quickly documented when compared to documenting the same code 
on the Codex, which requires more descriptions (preferably with proper 
grammar and simple English) use cases, and examples. The Shortcodes 
Codex Page is a good example of proper API documentation. I'm unsure how 
long it took, but it wouldn't have take as long to write inline 
documentation for the Shortcodes functions (a lot of the functions would 
only had required short descriptions).

The Inline Documentation Effort was also based on the theory that since 
the inline documentation is located right where the code is, it would be 
easier to maintain the documentation and keep it up to date unlike on 
some of the Codex pages.

As others have stated, I think I will try again and then see where it 
goes. If it again fails, well at least I'll be able to put on my resume 
that I know all of WordPress and not many can say that.

I have to agree with DD32, the main reason for the failure is that it is 
easier to complain about the lack of documentation and do nothing about 
it. It is easy to find the solution for ourselves and not tell anyone 
else about it (or just blog about it).

The problem is that if the inline documentation remains in the WordPress 
source, the conversations will instead turn from complaining about the 
lack of documentation to complaining about how the inline documentation 
is inaccurate. If that is the case, I would rather people complain about 
the lack of the documentation than that the current documentation is 
inaccurate.

You can make the argument that the Codex is not authoritative, but if 
the documentation is the source that it is. If you then make the 
statement that the inline documentation in the source is not 
authoritative also, then you have trust issues or I would assume.

I'm not sure anymore. I don't have 12 years of professional development 
experience. I only have a year, but I've been coding for a long time and 
I know that for the longest time, inline documentation is what has been 
missing. It is generally a good thing.

You are right, no one can force the issue, because this is an open 
source community driven project. Or that would be accurate if Automattic 
wasn't a for-profit company. I suppose the accurate statement was that I 
can't force the issue on the community, which does not work for money. 
I'm not part of Automattic which is a private company, so I can't change 
them either.

That isn't to make light of the awesome members of the community with 
the codex and with WordPress that aren't doing a kick ass job. One side 
of me acknowledges that there have already been many before me that 
tried to put forth the effort to add inline documentation. From that, I 
thought it would be easier for others like them to join in and correct 
mistakes and add in additional documentation that is needed.

Perhaps I could be like Lorelle is with the Codex and push for more 
effort in the inline documentation effort. I just need to find out how 
Lorelle does it and mimic it for the effort I'm pushing.

It is hard to criticize the project too much, because I know a lot of 
professionalism is being added to WordPress every day. However, I think 
in this area there needs to be additional work.

As an aside, I did try to be a good example, but I already stated how 
that turned out. Also, as project leader, if your developers don't 
listen to you about documentation, then you should slap them, because 
they should listen to you no matter their personal preference. Your 
title says "project leader," not "maybe they should listen to you, but 
eh, it is up to them." Of course, the work environment is different from 
the open source one, the project leader doesn't fully have that power.

Plenty of open source companies are for profit. Red Hat, MySQL,  
Mozilla - the list goes on. The software is free, but running a  
company is not. The corporations actually protect the project, keep it  
free and true to the GPL and ensure its long term survival. In fact,  
the whole point of the GPL is to give you freedom to do whatever you  
want with the source code, including making money from it. This  
includes you and me, as much as it does Automattic.

That is an accurate representation. PHP is mainly developed by the 
community, as is WordPress. Zend is a commercial entity supporting PHP, 
as Automattic is a commercial entity supporting WordPress.

Been getting a lot of spam in Akismet lately that contain URLs like the

It seems spammers are storing link farm files in these wpau-backup

A Google for wpau-backup reveals that a lot of these directories have
been indexed:

http://www.google.com/search?q=wpau-backup

Some of the results returned in that search query were actually linked
to in some of the spam I got.

What is wpau-backup used for? Does it have any known exploits?

Sorry, I'm bad about that. I can only offer up the poor excuse that at

Worst case scenario:
the plugin has a vulnerability that makes spammers able to inject content 
in the backup directory, ie uploading the file like:
> http://conexions.org/wordpress/wpau-backup/wordpress/wp-content/themes/classic/css/fence/fencing-tools.html

Best case scenario:
Malicious files were present before backup (ie there's another vuln 
somewhere) but anyway the plugin allows for directory indexing of 
potentially compromising stuff (don't know the plugin itself but I 
wouldn't like anyone to be able to see the whole list of files under my 
wordpress root)

So the answer is: yes, this is exploiting.

I don't use it so it doesn't affect me, best to somehow tell its users
though.

The server or something on it (possibly the plugin, but just because it's
using that directory doesn't mean it is) was exploited and since that
directory is writable, it was used.

This is yet another reason I don't suggest people leave their theme files
(or any other directory but an upload one) writable.

I think we have a couple of things going on here, that is giving the  
appearance of wp-au being exploited, but might not be. This is all  
speculation, but seems to make sense to me.

Some plug-in, theme, or older version of wordpress was exploited by  
spammers.
WP-AU faithfully backed the exploited directories up.
Poorly configured apache (directory browsing is turned on) makes it  
easy to search for them.

Now the plugin that is being exploited may be wp-au, I don't know as I  
don't use it. But it seems more likely that their live site had been  
stuffed with spam and the back up directory reflects that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Modern Hello Dolly for your review
Message-ID: <51E149B3-877B-49E5-A585-109D412F599D@tomransom.com>

Risking considerable flames, I am positing a "modern" Hello Dolly plug- 
in.

I have been working on developing WP plugins for clients and like  
most, learned by opening and reviewing other's plugins. The first plug- 
in we all look at is Hello Dolly. But Hello Dolly hasn't changed much  
since Matt first released it. (and why should it?)

I took a few moments this week to put together a "modern" Hello Dolly  
plug-in that others could use a template.  Some of the features include:
- Object-oriented class architecture (with PHP4/PHP5 construct/destruct)
- Tests that functions have been defined for executing them
- Tests that the class was successful constructed
    i.e. shouldn't break WordPress if the API were to change in the  
future (a best practice?)

I am posting this for your comments. I recently finished another  
plugin using these coding practices and was looking for a peer code  
review. I thought that Hello Dolly would be a perfect place to get  
feedback from long-time WordPress hackers on use of classes and coding  
(and documentation?) best practices.

I am attaching Hello Dolly, but on the chance that the mailing list  
engine strips attachments - I am also posting it at http://1bigidea.com/blog/wordpress

Thanks, and I am really looking forward to your feedback after this  
(U.S.) holiday weekend.

Hi Tom,
seems ok but I only looked some seconds...

What I would recommend is put the following stuff inside the constructor
since this would make it possible to create new instances which would add
themselfe automatically to the right places. Alternativly create a method
which calls the hooks. This way you can use $this which is perfect since it
can be used universally when inside the plugin classes methods.

        if ( function_exists('add_action') ) {
            // Now we set that function up to execute when the admin_footer
action is called
            add_action('admin_footer',
array(&$matt_hellodolly,'hello_dolly') );
            add_action('admin_head', array(&$matt_hellodolly,'dolly_css') );
        }

What I would really recommend would be to create a parent class "plugin"
which can be extended. This would drop any needs to check for functions
since they could be mapped inside this plugin class (which should then be
part of core and therefor up to date at any time).
This would make it possible to use something like
$this->add_action('foo','bar'); instead of the
add_action('foo',array(&$this,'bar')); which would be really handy.

Just my thoughts
Alex

I doubt that it's a RAM issue, probably some kind of issue with your
java setup in general.

I've used Eclipse for a few years for coding Java and just recently
started using it for PHP and have never noticed any performance
issues. The configuration of the thing is screwy sometimes, but it
runs great for the most part, on several different systems.

If you are looking for suggestions and tips on Object Oriented 
Programming, then I suggest you pick up some books on the subject. I do 
have suggestions, but they might be as good as Alex's and if that is the 
case, I better not write anything. There are probably only a few people 
here who have the knowledge and experience to answer your question and 
I'm not one of them.

This is the reason why I didn't reply in the first place. I didn't want 
to teach something that I don't know about myself. The blind leading the 
blind? I'll rather not.

You're right of course... sometimes I should just shut up...

The only thing I ment is: If you want to go the OO way one should start
writing a basic class which each plugin extends... that class can hold all
the helpers which would be needed anyway.

I know there are plugin authors which do it this way and I found the code
very well structured, readable and fast to extend... I'm just searching for
the plugin where I saw that first...I'll come back with it when I found
it...

In addition to Alexander's suggestions, the class should also not be started
until plugins_loaded technically to ensure all functions and such are fully
loaded. When plugin files are loaded, there are still missing functions such
as current_user_can().

Here's my shortest and simplest plugin. It contains from what my
understanding is the "recommended" method of writing a plugin:

Er, minus phpdoc that is. I don't usually document my plugins to that
extent, just a small comment on what a function does most of the time. I'm
lazy.

Its almost always the java virtual machine. Sometimes installing the  
JDK version helps (this is anecdotal not authoritative). Check it out

Yes.. i am using a 500 Hz pentium machine, and eclipse works fine.  It takes
time for loading, but after it got loaded, i dont see any performance
issues.

If we code from scratch, we may not need an IDE. but when we are exploring
another PHP application, an IDE like eclipse will certainly be useful..

I am using eclipse + PHP plugin for the past two years, and could not find
any other open source IDE as useful as this..  Even PDT lacks an important
feature, like "Ctrl+click" on a function will take us to the relevant file..

There are many, lighter 3rd party ECMA implementations of the Java
runtime environment (and the development kit) that may provide better
performance, the one I seem to hear the most about from a
performance-perspective is JRockit, but there aren't (m)any benchmarks
that show an actual benefit to using one JVM over the other.

* http://www.usenix.org/event/jvm02/full_papers/jacob/jacob_html/node12.html
* http://mashuntilnogood.blogspot.com/2005/12/jvm-performance-comparison.html
* http://www.shudo.net/jit/perf/

Bottom line is sheer performance is the same across most JVMs; however
if you want to conserve memory or run Java apps on an older,
lesser-spec'd machine then give JRockit a shot.

I'm currently using OpenJDK on Linux and the performance is OK
(ironically, I get more responsive GUI Java apps on Windows). OpenJDK
w/ IcedTea patches seems (anecdotally) faster than the proprietary JVM
packages.

Not to nitpick, but the Nano uses dual 80MHz processors. I was referring to
my Touch which has ~420MHz processor (depending on under/overclocking). :P

But we're going off-topic. My apologies.

I also use Zend Studio. It's not free or open source, which I dislike, 
but it's the only editor I've found which does the basic things I need.

* Code completion, automatically, without pressing any keys, of both PHP 
and custom functions. It works well for WP functions.
* Code navigation. CTRL-click a function / class / etc and it will take 
you to the relevant file / line.
* Highlighting, including basic parse errors

As an aside, guys, this is a very busy list, please, keep the "I meant 
MHz", ipod and other inane chatter to yourselves, please. We don't need 
to generate a new mail for each of those comments. On IRC or a quiet 
list it might not matter, but this list is huge and busy.

Cheers - Callum.

I think this is a valid point. I'm *all* in favour of documentation, 
particularly in-line. I think it's an excellent thing.

Presumably it wouldn't be that hard to strip it out for the "released" 
version of WordPress? So if you want the documentation, grab the code 
from svn. If not, grab the ZIP and get a nice light download.

This would require support from the core devs, packagers, etc.

Cheers - Callum.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin Version Numbering?
Message-ID: <008a01c8c01a$3c73bdc0$b55b3940$@com>

I am curious how people assign their plugin version number?  There was a
recent discussion which sort of touched on this but I'd like to touch on it
again.  Ideally I'd like to automatically use the Subversion revision number
as part of my documented version number - something like this:

 

Major Version:  2

Minor Version: 1

Build:  $LastChangedRevision$

 

If the SVN LastChangedRevision is 237 my version would be 2.1.237 and I'd
like  to then be able to have this number be automatically be populated in
the plugin header which appears as the version number of the Dashboard
Plugins page.  This is pretty easy to do with CVS but I can't figure out how
to suppress the SVN keyword stuff which wraps the keyword value.


Anyone doing anything like this?  If so, how are you doing it?

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

On general principle, it is a good idea when putting URLs into an  
email to wrap them in brackets, like so: <http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference 
 >.

If you do this, you will prevent dead links resulting from email  
programs getting confused as to what is part of the URL and what is  
not.  (In this instance, the close parentheses was being read as part  
of the link in OS X "Mail".)  I have yet to come across an email  
program that does _not_ properly read angle brackets as delimiters on  
URLs.

A small change to make everyone's life easier.  Sorry for the off- 
topic -- just addressing a common irritation.

PHP's ability to ignore comments is *extremely* fast, and it's highly
unlikely that you'd notice any performance difference whatsoever.

You'd get a *lot* more speed benefits out of a PHP opcode cache on the
server than you ever would with comment removal.

Sounds like a great idea. I'm down for using the AJAX API to serve
WordPress' Javascript.

It does sound like a great idea.

But how would this affect loading time? The browser has to go to  
another domain to grab the Ajax API  JS file, and then has to make  
another round-trip to load the JS library?

A simplified API is great, but does it have to be remotely hosted?  
What if, for instance, WordPress had its own JavaScript API-- you  
could put the code for each JS library in the database, and then the  
first time the file was requested, it could create a text-based cache  
of the file with the appropriate settings. Then, if the version of the  
code in the DB was updated, it could automatically replace the cached  
file.

Not trying to go off-topic here, but just saying. I like the premise,  
but the fact that it's remotely hosted worries me (even if it is  
Google).

My 2 euros:
I had the same thoughts a few hours ago, and my conclusions were: this
should be plugin territory to load JS files from your own install or
from Google.
- Lots of noisy people will scream if we rely on Google for JS serving
(while, admittedly, even more of silent people won't care) with more
or less clear claims about privacy and everything
- For the admin side of stuff, this isn't big deal (mostly one user so
there's no real benefit)
- For the public side of the blog, this is up to the theme author to
use Google's, his own, or WP's bundled scripts (most theme don't even
use wp-includes/js/ files, they add their own javascript directory)

What would be cool though would be that the whole javascript API set
of function could be hacked with a simple hook. Something like a new
action within wp_enqueue_script() that would either load from
wp-includes/js/ or from Google.

This would make things (slightly) faster. It's faster to load static
objects such as JS files from a static file server hosted on another
domain.

Not sure if I understood things correctly, but I think that we already
have this. wp_enqueue_script('jquery') looks like a simplified
Javascript API to me ...

We've seen Google kill API's before... (remember their SOAP search API  
anyone?) So I would not start relying on it, but for themes it could  
rock.

I agree, relying on them is probably not a great idea for core, but 
plugins or themes could make some great use of it.

As a side note, I'm still a little bitter about their SOAP search API.

I don't have much experience with this, personally.  Looks quite 
different from GWT, which we've had some negative experiences with here 
internally.

That said, it'd be very problematic to create a dependency for an active 
connection to google.com; my organization, like probably many others, is 
looking to WordPress (in our case, WPMU) for internally-facing blogs. 
Such systems often have limited external connectivity.

What problem, exactly, would we be trying to solve?  Bloat of 
installation?  Bloat of packaging and deploymnet?  Some quick clicking 
via Firebug suggests if there's bloat, it's more on the CSS side of 
things...

I'm liking the "Hookable" solution more myself, come to think of it --
allow for plugins to choose for Bret's internal use case.

Bret:
It's a maintenance thing.  Instead of the WP project worrying about
including the latest jQuery, etc., we can just have the JS "pointers"
begin pointing to the latest hosted out at Google.  Slims down the WP
core distro in the process, as well.

Probably less significant with the Gears stuff already in core - would 
be interesting as a plugin. (In theory WP.com could provide the same 
thing through our CDN.)

Your CDN is based off of S3? If so that wouldn't work too well outside  
of Europe and the US...

What happens if upstream changes something in an incompatible way? 
Deployed blogs could break when they changed nothing themselves.

I'm pretty ignorant on this topic, are there maintenance issues with the 
current javascript libraries?  Just trying to see the crux of the 
issue... code minimization is oftentimes a good goal, but we're really 
trading code for a dep.  And that brings its own host of issues into play.

> Slims down the WP
> core distro in the process, as well.

By "slim down", are you worried about:

1)  maintaining excessive amounts of WP-specific javascript?
2)  plugins using differing js libs, potentially incompatible ones?
3)  file size =)

The MU rpm I'm putting together for Fedora isn't very large :)

That seems like a good idea for a single site, where the admin can 
customize, update, maintain it as needed. Not sure about all the 
WordPress installations.

Also there's the Google Gears support in core now, eliminating even the 
head requests when loading cacheable files and letting them being 
refreshed easily. This improves page loading speed a lot, especially 
when Internet is slow.

Having it populate automatically based on the Subversion information would
be awesome, I'd like to know if this is possible too.

Callum, how do you have it set up with WP functions. Do you mean that the WP
functions work when creating a plugin? If so then what do you do, import the
entire WordPress installation so that it can process the function
information? Or do you mean it works with WP functions when you're working
on WordPress itself?

Alright, I've always delimited my URLs, just didn't know what to use. I
always have used []'s [ http://www.google.com ], but the angle brackets
don't look bad.

Presumably it wouldn't be that hard to strip it out for the "released"
version of WordPress? So if you want the documentation, grab the code from
svn. If not, grab the ZIP and get a nice light download.

Couldn't a script be written that does that? Just wondering. And if we only
want to get rid of the inline documentation we could prefix or somehow match
for inline documentation so that we don't get rid of other comments which we
might want to keep.

Of course, this is even if you guys think this is a good idea. I myself
don't know, though I am all for documentation.

I have a test install of WordPress where I develop my plugins. So I'm 
editing code directly on my dev server. I have a "project" defined in 
Zend which includes the whole WP install. So it can auto-complete 
function names, etc, etc.

It's not fool proof. It doesn't auto-complete action names, filter 
names, and so on. Sometimes it gets confused and thinks files are 
missing, or doesn't understand variables in include paths. But 
generally, it works pretty well. I find it invaluable when code 
browsing, tracking down exactly where something happens, etc.

Just to clarify, it will only work if you have the complete WP codebase 
available so it can "learn" the functions.

Cheers - Callum.

Agreed. My thought was for download size. WP uses a lot of small 
functions. If we document each one, it could add 50% to the size of the 
codebase. No need for every user to download all that extra weight.

It would be a toss up between the hassle of maintaining the comment 
stripping code, which would undoubtedly introduce bugs at some point, 
and the bandwidth / server load / etc cost of everyone downloading the 
comments.

As an aside, if we introduced some sort of "build" process, we could 
potentially pack / compact / etc our javascript files. Might allow for a 
performance boost.

Cheers - Callum.

And I assume it wouldn't work if one connected through FTP or SSH to their
install on their server right? I guess I'll do what you did.

I completely concur with Otto.
Not to mention, an extra, maybe 300kb in the distributable for inline 
documentation? I can't possibly image anyone getting their panties in a 
knot because the package went from 1.2Mb to 1.5Mb.

It's not like Javascript where we're sending the actual source file to 
the end-user on page loads.
Simply put, it just doesn't affect performance at all, but dramatically 
increases code maintainability. Which is especially important in an open 
source project, where who knows is going to have to deal with your code 
at a later date.

The jQuery library that WP is shipped with is already packed, and none 
of the other javascript files are large enough to benefit from any soft 
of minification or packing.

No. This is a benefit of it reading the phpdoc blocks on the local  
code and using that info to do code completion. One of the benefits  
that was touted in the thread about inline comments.

But, it's not as fast as if the comments weren't there. ;)

I would really like to see some tangible proof of that, I don't have, or 
have ever seen benchmarking data on a PHP running with vs. without comments.

I think that removing the documentation from the regular download  
would discourage new people who are just learning to code.  How many  
people just starting out will open up a file, see a bunch of dense  
code with NO commenting, and say "forget it"?

Even if it adds half a meg to the download -- is this really a  
problem???

(Personally, I _still_ don't use SVN.  Too much hassle for too little  
gain, IMO.)

I wasn't really "voting" any which way, just stating that no matter
how efficiently PHP handles comments, it'll never be as efficient as
without comments.

If it really makes a big difference, perhaps there can be a 
"Developer's" version with all the comments, etc. and a "regular" one 
that's combed out.

You are both wrong and right at the same time Matt. The short and sweet 
of it is that you'll gain more optimizing or removing functions then you 
would ever see removing functions from code. Read below for why.

There is currently no way to benchmark code with or without comments, 
because comments are stripped out during the first stage of PHP, 
performance tests will only benchmark the second stage.

Interesting enough, one application (OpenX, was OpenAds, was PHPAdsNew), 
did notice a 20% performance increase. They went from 100 milliseconds 
to 80 milliseconds or something along that by stripping out all spaces, 
tabs, duplicate new lines and combining files by way of a build script.

You must pardon my lack of interest from gaining 20% when the actual 
numbers really don't matter. If you ask my opinion, it was merely 
coincidence and by from my benchmarks, include/require-ing a file takes 
up most of the time anyway. What they might had attributed to removing 
all comments and white space might had been just combining all of their 
files.

As I've said, comments are stripped out during the first stage of PHP, 
as well as newlines. Actually, everything is compiled into bytecodes 
(opcodes, whatever) and then run. As I've said before, you can't 
benchmark that within PHP (nothing I've seen says that even XDebug 
benchmarks it).

Therefore it is an impossibility to have accurate numbers. What you have 
is a theory and an accurate one. Parsing comments out does take time 
that wouldn't be needed, however if you were to ever notice a 
difference, it is either, because they copied the contents of two 
volumes of books into the source either kick ass documentation or just 
for the fun of it.

For all that PHP does: opening files, reading files, interpreting 
(parsing), compiling, and then executing, it does a really quick job.

Where was I wrong then? I never said there would be any significant
performance improvements, just that without comments, it's faster
(even if by nano-seconds) then with comments. Which is a *little* less
load on the server, which is always good.

That line should read, "...gain more optimizing or removing functions 
then you would ever see removing comments..." sorry for the ambiguous 
statement. A little less load would only be good if you had as much 
traffic as Yahoo, Facebook, or another very high traffic site where 
every ounce of performance gain would be worth it.

When doing optimizations you want to get the most "bang for your buck"? 
Gaining a possible millisecond or two or whatever which is unmeasurable 
compared to the time it would take to write the build script is not 
worth it. This is compared to the time you would gain from optimizing 
other parts of WordPress, which would gain more of an notable 
performance increase.

Furthermore, as it has been mentioned, if you use Opcode Caching, it 
mutes the point completely because once the comments are removed, the 
opcodes are passed to the opcode caching and stored. Comments are not 
part of any opcode cache, therefore, if you really wanted to remove 
comments and gain true performance from doing so, you would need to use 
the opcode cache.

There isn't any more load removing comments then there is removing 
whitespace, then there is parsing foreach, function names, variable 
names, etc. It is all part of the same parsing cycle and unless you want 
to get into the Zend Engine core in order to find out what it is. I 
would be very interested to know.

What it is, is a theory that because most characters have to be looked 
at that comments would slow down parsing. With as quickly as it can 
parse the entire WordPress code base I'll say a few comments here or 
there in every file won't cause a difference. That is my theory.

What I think you are wrong then, is that you aren't weighing the 
importance of documentation compared to the small gain of its removal?

You know, I'm going to do some more research on the matter. There might 
actually be a way to tell how long it took between the start of request 
(however, I'll have to ask the PHP Internals list what that means), the 
time XDebug says the script took, and the difference between the start 
of the request and the end of the request. If this experiment is 
correct, then it, in theory, might be able to tell us how long PHP took 
for the first stage as compared to the second stage.

Then basically, I'll need to write a script that (ironically) needs to 
remove all of the comments and run through the process again. It would 
be better if others who had XDebug could help, because I don't trust my 
personal machine which runs a lot of processes in the background to 
accurately tells. The start of the request, might also be the start of 
the second stage and not the first stage as I hope.

The problem is that in order to prove my point, I must speak in 
absolutes in order to counter your argument. There aren't any. I will 
say that must users of WordPress will not see a difference with or 
without comments, so what other advantage do comments have that would 
justify its existence in the WordPress core?

I would edit this long email down, but I have to go to work and I don't 
have time for editing out the parts I don't need.

I'd agree if the function was new, but it's much too late to add it.

I never said that. Documentation is helpful, but (probably going to
start up some sort of flame war here :P ) wouldn't it be better if it
was located in some sort of Developer-only docs (separate from the
Codex, which would be end-user-oriented), rather than in the code? The
just put a link to the docs in a comment above the function.

I'm with Matt here, but of course my say is nothing because I'm not as
experienced as you guys. It just seems more logical to have it some place
else. Or maybe the inline docs can be parsed and generated into an external
doc? As is the case with some documentation programs, maybe there's
something like this for PHP? I'm pretty sure there is, I'm just not as
experienced, like I said.

I meant not actually have the documentation in the code. Which also
makes it easier for people to contribute to the docs, since they won't
have to make a Trac ticket, a patch and then wait for it to be
committed. Which is also less work for the people with commit access.

I realize what you meant. This was in reply to Jorge's question:

"Or maybe the inline docs can be parsed and generated into an external
doc? As is the case with some documentation programs, maybe there's
something like this for PHP?"


I find, from experience, that maintaining inline code is *easier, *more reliable than external documentation. Use case: patch in one function, fixes an outstanding bug and maybe slightly changes the way something works. You can fix the docs right there, right then in the docblock above the function, and the patch itself can update the documentation, rather than the community relying on either you or someone else to update external docs, which (honestly) never really happens.

Just for giggles, everyone involved in this discussion should take a look at what is required of ZF contributors, w/r/t inline documentation:
<http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/ZF+Coding+Standards+%28RC%29#ZFCodingStandards%28RC%29-InlineDocumentation>

Hey all,

In the next few days, I plan to release a new plugin for Wordpress.  It 
provides a Wordpress interface to the Featurific website plugin, a 
plugin designed to provide main-page slideshows for featured posts - 
similar to the featured stories/products slideshows on time.com, 
walmart.com, etc.***  (See the end of this email for more info on 
Featurific).

Although I am an experienced programmer, this is my first Wordpress 
plugin.  I've tested it and found it to work on Wordpress 2.3+.  
However, I'm sure I've overlooked something.  Would you mind installing 
it on a test installation and providing any feedback you might have?

Archive location:
*http://featurific.com/files/FeaturificForWordpress.zip*

Once activated, the plugin can be configured on the Settings -> 
Featurific page.  (I was going to put this page within the "Plugins" 
menu, but I read on Codex that the recommended location for config pages 
like this is in "Settings".  However, given recent list discussion, I'm 
no longer sure where to put the config page! :) )


Anyway, thanks again for any feedback you might have,
-Rich



***Some background on Featurific: The plugin is a flash-based 
gallery/slideshow that displays rotating screens of the host site's 
featured stories. (Similar rotators can be seen on msn.com, 
nationalgeographic.com, walmart.com, etc). Featurific requires a fair 
amount of configuration to get it working which is the motivation for 
this plugin. Following the awesome precedent of Wordpress' 5 minute 
installation, Featurific for Wordpress handles all configuration and 
installation when the plugin is enabled. However, power users are still 
allowed to tweak configuration and override any parameters.

You must forgive me, it is never my intention to ever start a flame war. 
With that in mind, when I do start "attacking" someone I always prepend 
the sentence with "I think..." to avert probable false accusations 
(however, I'm quite honest about what I think and I don't really care 
how you take it).

There is such a thing, it is called DocBook and it is an XML format. 
Luckily, phpdoc can be formatted in such a way as to output it. There is 
currently a Google Summer of Code project working with PhD, which I 
believe is a DocBook render (I'm unsure if it is real time like XSL, but 
the speed is considerable).

It has my interest and I look forward to looking more into it. If it is 
possible to output phpdoc into DocBook Format and then extend that to 
create as good as developer documentation as what php.net has, then I 
think it would be solid.

If that is the case, then it would be favorable to implement your 
suggestion, as the DocBook would be better at giving developers what 
they need, whereas the default phpdocumentor HTML output isn't very 
helpful, unless you know where and what you are looking for.

As an aside, there is likely a build process already or at least I hope 
someone isn't going in and taking them out by hand. The {@internal 
Missing Short Description}} are all removed from the distribution builds 
of WordPress.

I didn't mean that you did. I guess I was wrong about me starting a
flame war then. :P

try using // instead of / - tell you what - it works the same.
There is no difference in going to
http://wordpress.org//download/
or
http://wordpress.org/download/

both work perfectly.

So I would say with that it is not to late to change it since this would
make both possible (hardcoding the / or not).

It is a hit on Apache though. Minor, but Apache needs the slash to determine
file or directory. It's an access time issue.
Say you type in http://wordpress.org/extend

Apache responds by looking for a file called extend. Access point A. It
doesn't find it, so it fails back on directory lookup. Access point B. The
slash just saves Apache some access time and a little work. Neglible on a
small level. Big on scale.

Personally, though, I think the slash at this point is moot for what it
gains us.

Yeah, it's very minor and users are expecting no trailing slash (which
applies to more things than just URLs -- regex, str_replace(), etc.). As the
saying goes, If it's not (truly) broken, don't fix it.

Dude, that doesn't apply to hackers and geeks.

Viper: Template Tags are used (most of the time) to give you somewhat like
the templates directory. You will then go and append the / and the file you
want to access.
So the old templates (with hardcoded /) would create:
http://sub.example.org/path/wp-content/templates/mine//custom_style.css
new ones (without hardcoded /) would create
http://sub.example.org/path/wp-content/templates/mine/custom_style.css
which both work the same.
Users will not expect anything - they will not have anything to do with that
and the template directory will not be a place you want anyone browsing to.

Template Creators would expect the / to be there cause it will be needed
allways. So I really don't understand your point. Additional /es do not harm
anyone - left out /es will make templates break...

I don't really care if there is a automatic / or not - but I don't see any
way where this would harm anything....

I'm sorry, what problem would be solved by adding the trailing slash?

Thanks Alex, but I'm quite aware of what they are for and how a double slash
works. ;)

My point is the function has been expected to output no trailing slash and
while adding a trailing slash wouldn't break any themes, it would cause
additional load on servers (albeit minor) as well has have the distinct
possibility of breaking some plugins that expect no trailing slash for
coding purposes. Not to mention the double slash looks ugly as heck and
would probably result in a billion support requests from users asking what's
causing it.

Look, I'd love it if the function had originally been coded to output a
trailing slash, but it wasn't and there's no valid reason I've heard so far
to change it. And no, having to type an extra character doesn't count as one
in my book. :)

My 2 cents.

None - would just stop you from having to add the slash every time you use
the tag...
And would be intelligent since all directories should have a trailing slash
since they are diretories and not files...

As I said before: I don't care if there is a automatic "/" or not... I just
wanted to point out there is no harm when it is added... so if one really
wants to do it it isn't too late since you wouldn't break anything...

>I'm sorry, what problem would be solved by adding the trailing slash?

This would help people running incorrectly configured apache with virtual 
hosts. There is a well known problem where misconfiguration makes apache 
fail to lookup directory (apache looks for *file* /something on virtual 
host and ends up trying *directory* /something/ on default site. Something 
like 
<http://planetozh.com/blog/2004/05/apache-and-the-trailing-slash-problem/>)

I'm not saying that it's actually worth it, just saying it could help a 
few people. Actually I don't think it would be a good idea, the double 
slashes generated here and there in URLs would probably confuse more 
people than it would help a few misconfigured Apache.

i think that writing "<?php path_to_styles(); ?>screen.css" or "<?php 
path_to_images(); ?>image1.jpg" is a bit silly and non-intuitive.
I preffer old, "<?php path_to_styles(); ?>/screen.css" and <?php 
path_to_images(); ?>/image1.jpg" way.

Sorry for double-posting. As i'm professional template-maker, i must add 
that trailing slash in paths generated by php is one of most annoying 
things in Drupal for me.

Then please tell me why it is unintuitive to write the file... it is
unintuitive to write a slash if you allready have a path (which could
contain the slash, since the path should only contain directories and
everyone online should find that directorys get trailing slashes
automatically in URLs.

Then tell me why it is silly  to write the filename and just the
filename....

I'd say this is somewhat everyone will have his own preferences but I can
not see why one or the other would be silly

while adding a trailing slash wouldn't break any themes, it would cause
> additional load on servers


I am not to sure about that one... I don't think it would create any
additional load.
Every single OS I've worked with was damn fast in recognizing that "here" is
./ and that a // is nothing else than a /. To be precise you will not be
301-Redirected with // while you will with no slash at all.

Anyway: Don't change it since there is no real need to and people are used
to it allready...

Because for me <path>/file.php is more intuiteve, and better 
readable/understandable (sory for my bad english) than only <path>file.php.
As far as i remember i used <path>\<file> even in "MS-DOS 5" times. 
Later was, MS.DOS 6.x series, MS Windows 3.x series, MS Windows 9x 
series, then i got internet connection and i was also using 
<path>/<file> in my work, then came Windows 2000 and Windows Server 
series - all time standard is <path>/file not <path>file, now i'm 
developing Wordpress themes and im also using <path>/<file>. Why change 
something, which is standard for over 20 years of computing?

This is the _only_ argument I've seen that IMO supports taking the  
documentation out of the source.

I'm not very SVN-savvy, but would it be possible to give more people  
something like "comments only" commit access?  Then we could spread  
the burden of committing patches that are nothing but documentation  
updates.

For what it's worth, I agree with this reasoning.  <path>/file.php is  
easier to understand, and if not  more _intuitive_, then more  
_ingrained_.

Putting it another way:  When reading code, function().'string' could  
be anything.  function().'/string' strongly suggests "this is a path"  
before I look any farther.

And anyway we've already discussed that function().'/file.php' could, on 
worst case scenario, result in "path//file.php".

OK. So... Time to close this discussion ? :)

I've knocked up a plugin which replaces references to JS libraries in
WordPress with the corresponding files on the Google AJAX Libraries
API, where supported.

Due to several libraries in WordPress being broken into disciplines,
only the core files get replaced in these circumstances, but it may
serve as a starting point for anyone who wants to put a little more
work into it.

Find the plugin here if you're interested:
<http://lud.icro.us/wordpress-plugin-google-ajax-libraries/> .

Does jQuery still run in compatibility mode if you use Google's libraries?

	please
Message-ID: <8f93a7390805300137r111b03a2y4d334e582a45d93@mail.gmail.com>

If anyone's looking for something to do, I'd appreciate this plugin being
tested, especially by those using TinyMCE:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/chili-code-highlighter/

It's similar to the SyntaxHighlighter plugin I helped write (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/ ) but it uses WP 2.5
shortcodes (with some hackery for pre-10 running) and a jQuery plugin called
"Chili" which is crazy fast. Chili also doesn't require invalid XHTML,
unlike SyntaxHighlighter which does sadly.

It does lack the cool line numbering, etc. of SyntaxHighlighter, but it
wouldn't be too hard I'd image to extend this plugin to add that if it
becomes a majorly wanted feature.

I have yet to port over the kses handling (so users without the
unfiltered_html cap can post code), but the rest should hopefully work fine.

I'm also all ears on any coding ideas anyone has to offer if someone can
think of a better way to do what I did -- having my shortcode run
pre-wpautop() and pre-wptexturize() to avoid either function mucking up my
code. There are tickets open on that BTW. I also had to use some wrapper
functions so I could figure out what tag I was on (there's a ticket for that
too).

Thanks! :)

I thought you initiated jquery's no conflict mode manually, after it
was loaded. Like this:

<script src="prototype.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script>
jQuery.noConflict();

Good day list.

Just a quick note to see if anyone here is interested in participating  
in a team project.
I know that many plugins are individual projects, but we'd like this  
to be full featured, but not full time.

heres our initial draft of functionality.

Automatic slideshow creator.
for - posts / pages / templates.

     * Insert [superslider] tag into post or page automatically  
creates slide show pulling x number of recent images into slideshow
     * Insert [superslider(category=mycat)] tag into post or page  
automatically creates slide show pulling x number of recent images  
from said category into slideshow
     * Insert [superslider(tag=mytag)] tag into post or page  
automatically creates slide show pulling x number of recent images  
from said tag into slideshow
     * Insert function call superslider(active) into template  
automatically creates slide show pulling x number of recent images  
from active category / tag / archives into slideshow. So if you insert  
this function into your category.php template file the slideshow will  
know which category is active and pull it's images from that category

     * built in lightbox
     * multiple widget versions
     * built on mootools 1.2 http://www.mootools.net/
     * built with Slideshow2 http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow/
     * full options
     * theme based visuals

Any functionality suggestions, or interest in participating contact  
directly.
Thanx for your time

Thanx Viper,
I was just reading that same page this afternoon.

If I understand correctly, in our case, shortcode would replace:
$content = preg_replace_callback( "/(<p>)?\[qt:([^]]+)](<\/p>)?/i",  
"my_embed", $content );

with the shortcode call:
add_shortcode('my-shortcode', 'my_shortcode_handler');

then called by the user with my quicktag button:
which could insert:
[my-shortcode foo="bar" baz="bing"]

which then will activate my_shortcode_handler.

Then the my_shortcode_handler will have an add_filter:
add_filter($tag,  $function_to_add,  $priority = 10,  $accepted_args =  
1);

Please correct me if I'm misunderstanding something here.

It was bound to happen. The only reason they were on MT was because the
Gawker network runs it. With them leaving Gawker, it makes sense.

Oh. Well, I just put it on my site and it appears to work okay. All
the javascript stuff seems to work fine on the dashboard side of
things. Seems quite a bit faster, actually. But then, of course,
Google has a much faster web server than my little site does. :)

So it works with TinyMCE without having to switch to source/code view?

I wonder why someone hasn't created a TinyMCE plugin for syntax
highlighting. Maybe one clicks a button which opens a pop up where the
code is pasted, and only something like [code-listing-#] where # is
the number of the code listing. Then when the post is, well, posted,
it interprets that as the code using some type of filter (Of course
that would mean that the code would have to be inserted into a
database on its own). Pretty complicated but it's the only way I can
imagine being able to use syntax highlighting plugins with TinyMCE, or
does anyone else know another way?

Yes, it'd replace your regex and parsing of the attributes. You could just
do  [superslider category="mycat"]  and your function would get passed an
array: $atts = array( 'category' => 'mycat' );

You don't need an add_filter() though. It's already added at priority 11 and
loops through all shortcodes.


Check out this very simple plugin of mine for BBCode:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bbcode/   Note that the content bit is
only for non-self-closing tags (like [mytag]content[/mytag]) and I call
do_shortcode() on my $content so you can have shortcodes within shortcodes.

Correct. You can paste your code directly into TinyMCE and it should display
normally.

Ouch, they based their theme on Kubrick rather than making one from scratch.
I'm also surprised their site isn't using WP-(Super-)Cache.

But still, great to see another switch. :)

Wow, then I'm definitely going to try this!

By the way, maybe it's a stub, but plugin link on wordpress.org
http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/chili-code-highlighter/ gives
404.

I have (don't have a link handy though), and it was a very miniscule  
difference. This is a moot point to make for or against inline docs.

Oh, I completely agree. I just wanted to prove to the people that 
suggested it that it was foolish at best.

Using this to load the default js libraries in WordPress would probably 
not increase the speed of the admin.

In theory, after the first access all static files, js, css and images, 
are stored in the browser's cache. Next time the page is accessed, these 
files are loaded from the cache. The browser makes requests to the 
server only to check for updated versions.

Since we have Gears now, all these requests are local too. When loading 
an admin page there are only 1-2 requests sent to the server. Using 
Google Ajax API to load js libraries would actually be slightly slower, 
as the library would not be cached in Gears.

On the other hand using the API for loading js on the front pages or in 
a plugin that doesn't use the WordPress defaults would increase the 
speed for the site's visitors and also reduce bandwidth usage.

To do that easily, perhaps we need a function that plugs into 
wp_print_scripts() or similar and would switch to using Google Ajax API 
only on the front end, and could be included/referenced in other plugins 
(needs a hook). Perhaps that could make it in core too.
