Perhaps testing has shown that most users don't get it, that's why there's
now this redundant toolbar.

I think it might be quite handy if you've disabled the auto-resize and
don't see the TinyMCE toolbar because you scrolled down the content.

Also, inline editing is far more intuitive IMHO. Look at Medium, for
example.

Cheers,
Pascal

Subject: [wp-hackers] Language packs for plugins
Message-ID: <548B6A46.80307@wordshell.net>


Hi,

I'm trying the current status of language packs for plugins - 
particularly, how WordPress and wordpress.org are handling the removal 
of translations from plugin downloads themselves, to shrink their size.

I noticed that WooCommerce had removed their language packs from their 
plugin. But, https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/5485 seems 
to indicate that they built a custom solution for this inside their plugin.

So, I think that currently WordPress doesn't yet support unbundling of 
language packs for plugins. From Google, there seems no new information 
on this idea in the last year, as far as plugins go (core now has a 
solution) - is this correct? Anyone know if/when this might change?

Best wishes,
David

Hey,

Any updates regarding GSOC 2015? Is WordPress participating this time? Has
any ideas page been created?

I would like to participate in the Google summer of Code 2015 and would
like to apply under WordPress (I also tried for GSOC 2014 but wasn't
selected). How should I proceed this time? Any ideas that have been
finalised and their mentors decided?

I haven't heard any discussions yet, and the organization applications 
don't even open for another 5 weeks, but we've participated for the past 
7 years, so there's a good chance that we will again this year.

You should watch https://make.wordpress.org/core for an announcement, 
but it probably won't be for another month or two.

Student applications don't open until March 16th, so you've got plenty 
of time to prepare. The next few months are a good time to get involved 
with the community and familiar with the codebases by making 
contributions. We usually receive a couple hundred applications, but 
only accept a handful. The vast majority of applications are from 
students with no history of contributing, so you'll have a better chance 
if you've proven yourself to be a solid contributor.

Check out the following sites for more information:

* http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014 - the 2015 guidelines, processes 
and projects will probably be similar 2014
* https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/ - basic information on 
contributing to Core (most of which also applies to the Meta team)
* https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/good-first-bugs - Core tickets 
for new contributors
* https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/report/10 - Meta tickets for new 
contributors
