You're right.  My mistake.

The problem lies in the $wp->parse_request() method, which sets
permalink query variables only if they're not empty, instead of
checking whether they're set.

Hello all:

I was wondering if the WordPress Plugins Directory's source code is
available as a "plugin" for WordPress.  I am interested in hosting my
own plugins repository with our WordPress installation and was
wondering if the code is readily available.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Cheers,

Bernard

I have no authority on this subject but I think the short answer is "No"

The code is available. The system is not very easy to set up, though:

No, the to_ping column only holds manual trackback values you inserted
on a post.

You should look for a meta_key on the post named "_pingme". That gets
set for new posts, and the do_all_pings function processes those posts
for links and then does the pingbacks for them.

pinged + to_ping = trackbacks.
_pingme = pingbacks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WXR format documentation
Message-ID: <4A9D3F9A.5080006@gmail.com>

I have an old photo blog running a really old version of WordPress (some
Frankensteinian hybrid of b2 and 1.0, I think). I would like to export
its content to my current journal performing some useful transformations
(like moving old categories to corresponding tags, working around some
hacks that I did to store just an image URL and its title as my post
content etc.).

I was wondering if someone could point me to the canonical documentation
on the WordPress WXR file format so I could construct it and suitably
import it into my journal.

(I thought about upgrading 1.0 -> 1.2 -> 1.5 ... until I reach a
WordPress version that can export itself as an XML file, but I must
transform the file heavily anyway afterwards. It seems easier to
construct an appropriate XML export directly from the database.)

Thanks,
Harish

Thanks for the link.

I noticed that the plugin is for bbPress -- are plugins from bbPress
interchangeable with WordPress?

Also, are there any plans to further extend this code to make it more
setup friendly?  Assuming we are going to go ahead and use this to
power our plugins repository, we may be able to contribute something
back.

Cheers,

Bernard

No, but wordpress.org has large sections of it run by bbPress. The
forums, for example.

I see -- so it sounds like in order for me to setup the Plugins
Directory for our WordPress installation, we'll need to setup bbPress
alongside WordPress, have it talk to WordPress and then install the
plugin -- is this correct?

Thanks,

I  don't think the repository plugin for bbPress needs to be connected to a
WordPress install.
But you'll probably want some integration, since I presume your site is
powered by WP.

Exactly. The plugin repository runs on bbPress.

Yeah I think we'll look into setting up the integration.

If we were to run into issues setting this up, is this a good place
for questions or should I ask them some place else?

For issues with bbPress, you'll want to go to the support forums there:

After pingbacks the meta key must get cleared then, huh?
SELECT * FROM `wp_postmeta` where meta_value like '%ping%' ORDER BY
`post_id` DESC

Results in 0 rows found

Curiouser and curiouser.

I'm not sure whether it contains upgrade code for 1.2 or 1.5, but
versions of WordPress today contain upgrade code for all previous
versions (at least back to 1.5, possibly further).

So you can jump from WordPress 1.5 to 2.8, for instance.

Might be worth making a copy of your DB into a new database and seeing
what happens if you throw it at WordPress 2.8.

Hmm. Perhaps I will try this. I have been googling for reference
documentation on WXR for a couple of days and I haven't stumbled upon
anything.

I guess the plan then reads:

Make a DB copy -> Try upgrading to 2.8 (either directly or via an
intermediate step) -> Extract WXR -> Transform WXR -> Import WXR into
another DB.

Thanks,
Harish

No, not meta_value.

meta_key = '_pingme'

I assume this list is truncated? (Otherwise, I don't see how the average
could be smaller than the smallest datapoint.)

Ooops, sorry.
Well, I have exactly two records with meta_key = '_pingme' in my postsmeta
table.
They appear to be referring to posts that don't exist from 3 years ago
(based on post_id).

Message-ID: <0b5f8e7c-5a2c-4e1d-84c9-e449292a879b@z16g2000yqe.googlegroups.com>

I tried digging around the source to see if I could find this on my
own, but couldn't sort it out.  I'd like to disable the fetching of
the three Wordpress-related feeds in the dashboard altogether.  I know
they can be hidden on a per-user basis from the screen settings, but
I'd like to just nix the functions - no fetching and no caching of the
feeds, for all users.

Is there an action I can remove to do this?  Can I use remove_action
on a function *within* the do_action function (as  believe this is how
these feeds are called)?

Any help would be great - thanks.
Derek

As far as I know, nobody has created any reference documentation for 
WXR. The best reference is really the PHP source for the importer and 
exporter in WordPress itself. As the name (WordPress eXtended RSS) 
implies, it's basically RSS with some extra WP-specific elements added in.

I worked on a project involving WXR a while back, but it hasn't been 
released to the public (yet), so I'm afraid I can't say much about that. 
But I can say that looking at the source for the importer will give you 
a pretty good idea of what it's expecting.

Okay, let's run down how pingbacks work, then you can figure out where
the breakage is.

1. When a post is published, if the default_pingback_flag option is
set, then _pingme gets added to the postmeta as a key. The
default_pingback_flag is the "Attempt to notify any blogs linked to
from the article" checkbox on the Settings->Discussions page.

2. Publishing also schedules the do_pings event for immediate
execution in the wp-cron system.

3. When wp-cron fires, it runs the do_pings hook, which is connected
to do_all_pings().

4. First thing do_all_pings() does is to look for posts that have
_pingme on them. For each one, it removes the _pingme and passes it to
the pingback() function.

5. pingback() sifts through the post_content, looking for any urls.
For each one, it loads the URL and looks for the pingback link in it.
If it finds one, it sends out an XML-RPC ping to it.

6. On a ping success, it pops the URL into the pinged column of the
post, to prevent later edits from pinging it again.

Any break in the steps along that path will break pings.

Message-ID: <4A9EB72C.7030003@delpeuch.eu>

Hi all,

I just discovered the WP API and it seems really powerful. The 
documentation is quite deep, and I didn't find answers to my questions yet.
First, I would like to create automaticly a public page (a static page, 
as the "About me" one). I didn't found functions for that.

Then, I have to handle data coming from a public formular (method POST). 
I saw how to save options from a formular, but what if I have to store 
the data in a database ?

Thanks !

Subject: [wp-hackers] 404 Pages displaying as blank
Message-ID: <3a53d87b$28bf2566$79372914$@com>

Hello,

I'm experiencing a strange problem I'm hoping someone here may have some 
suggestions on how to solve.

I started a thread here: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/305273 but 
haven't received any replies. To save me having to retype it all I'd 
appreciate it if you could look there for the details.

In summary I've got my first WordPress site up and running with rewrites 
working as expected for everything apart from one small, but annoying 
glitch.

My 404 pages are all shown as 'blank' pages. If you look at the details 
I've confirmed this behaviour on a fresh install with no plugins. Pemalinks 
is set to /%postname%/, the site is hosted on IIS 6 and has Helicon's 
ISAPI_Rewrite installed.

I've inserted error_log statments into parse_query in classes.php and can 
confirm that the 'query' for 404 pages is 'name=error=404&page='. The 
headers of returned pages indicate a 404 Not Found code, but the pages are 
blank. This implies the rewriting is fine.

The last interesting thing is that I also added error_log statements into 
many of the theme files and the 'log entries' per invalid url request 
terminate in different components of the 'theme'. Details in post.

Any suggestions and help appreciated.

Thank you
Leon

Can you disable the rewriting and see if that changes anything?

What about adding:
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
to your wp-config.php file, does that reveal anything?

Dion,

I have WP_Debug defined as true and there are no 'error' message that I can 
see. I know the log is working as I get the error_log output :-)

When you say disable rewriting, what do you mean. Remove the 'default' 
entries from .htaccess and switch of permalinks?

Apologies if this is either a new thread or multiple mails. I haven't used 
a mailing list for a couple of years.

I'm unable to access my hosted files from my current location so can't 
remove the redirection. Will be able to do so in about 5-6 hours and will 
report outcome here. If you wanted to 'see' what I have I have done a 
'vanilla' install at preview.tawnylion.com that is currently configured to 
/%postname% as permalinks and the 'default' redirection of 

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]

If my memory serves me right with a default install, using the default 
permalinks settings I kept getting the index page. This is with IIS6 
configured to a custom error page of /index.php?error=404.

With redirection as described it displays blank as it 'dies' somewhere 
whilst processing the 404.php file

Hi,

I'm playing with plugins_api() function to retrieve other plugins
which added the tag 'nextgen-gallery' as tag in the readme.txt file,
but the API convert the dash into a space : see here
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/nextgen-gallery

Has somebody a workaround or whom can I contact for a search fix ?

Thanks for any tip

Well, one easy workaround is to not use tags with dashes in them.
Seems the best way. Tags should be simple, since humans see and type
them. Expecting people to use odd punctuation is not a good way to go.

WordPress handles 404's internally. You don't need to define a custom
error page. Just let it redirect to the index.php like normal.

The 404 page served by WordPress is whatever is in 404.php in your
theme directory.

Dion and Otto,

I'm currently testing and playing on http://preview.tawnylion.com

I've followed Dion's suggestion of completely removing the htaccess/ 
redirection.

If I remove the IIS6 custom 404 handler pointing to /index.php? 
error=404 then the 'home' page works, but nothing else. Everything  
returns 404 pages?
With the /index.php?error=404 on the IIS6 custom handler all works  
whether I have .htaccess or not. All, except the 'real' 404 errors.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding a front end page without adding a "page"
Message-ID: <4AA08646.9040101@gmail.com>

Hi all,

In a plugin I am trying to add a front end page. This page should use 
the template as generated by the single.php template.

In Contact Form 7, the user creates a page using the Add page interface 
and places a shortcode to make the form appear in the
page. I would like to be able to do this automatically without the use 
having to do anything.

Any idea how I can achieve this?

your best bet is going to be to insert a page with a shortcode  
automatically in the page.

look into wp_insert_post() with post_type = 'page'

Don't forget to include a message informing the user that a new page
will automatically be created (or better still, give them an option).

I was able to go through the exporter code and modify it for my needs.

I don't suppose ditching IIS and using Apache is an option, huh? :)

Seriously, though, AFAIK you should be able to get WordPress working 
fine with IIS7 and the rewrite module you mentioned. But I haven't 
touched IIS in forever, so I don't have any practical advice to offer 
(other than switching to Apache).

Subject: [wp-hackers] shortcodes, BR tags and feed/XML-RPC interfaces
Message-ID: <FE041552-E714-4DCD-9190-2CDEC41C3C5A@g8o.net>


Hello all,

I wrote a quick and dirty shortcode as part of my WP theme that lets  
me use a multi-line shortcode:

[qfgallery]
URL-to-image-1
URL-to-image-2
[/qfgallery]

to generate a custom image gallery using FancyBox.

Despite what this thread (http://bit.ly/u2kvv) seems to suggests (or  
perhaps I am reading it wrong), it seems that in my shortcode handler,  
I get <br/> tags after each line in $content. I am parsing it out but  
I am curious if this is expected behaviour.

Also, one shortcoming of my quick and dirty trick seems to be that  
though my splendid FancyBox gallery is rendered correctly in the  
browser, when the content is pulled via the feed or XML-RPC the  
shortcode is left as-is -- which is understandable I guess since the  
theme only applies to browser rendering. Is this correct? i.e., there  
is no way for me, in my theme code, to enable shortcode expansion for  
post content for feeds and XML-RPC?

One way to overcome this may be to add an action or filter, which  
would entail (if I am getting it right) the creation of a plugin. I do  
not want the plugin to modify the content as it is saved i.e., I do  
not want it to hook into the post editing function. That would cause  
the shortcode to be expanded/replaced on saving, preventing future  
edits. I could instead, I hope, add a filter that would kick in when  
the content is accessed (irrespective of the reason/means of access,  
whether it be for rendering in browser, or for feed or XML-RPC).

Any suggestions, comments or advice would be great. Thank you,

	--ravi

Simon,

I did not find a solution that met all of my requirements, but it
works for me. I just put all of the scripts in a single file and load
it using one wp_enqueue_script call. The problem is that I lose all of
the extra features of wp_enqueue_script by doing it this way.

I might look into dequeueing the scripts, but I haven't looked to see
how that fits into the lifecycle yet. My ticket about it was closed,
but there is another similar one still open (from 3 years ago):

Bryan,

query_posts() effectively says to WordPress "I know you THOUGHT you
should load these XYZ posts (home page, category listing, single
article, whatever), but actually what this page *IS* is something
else, and i'll tell you what with query_posts()". When you use it you
completely reset the page.

So if you are on the homepage and you do a query_posts('cat=1'); then
right before that line is_home() will be true but right after it will
be false. After that is_cat() would return true instead.

If you need extra queries you should just use the object instead:

$myposts = new WP_Query('cat=1');

Then you just need a slightly modified loop:

if ($myposts->have_posts() ) : while ($myposts->have_posts()) :
$myposts->the_post() ;

Until I figured that one out I was constantly having problems with
conditional tags not doing what I expected. Clean up your extra
queries and your life will be a lot simpler.

Ahh. IIS. Ugh. IIS doesn't use .htaccess and doesn't know about URL
rewriting without custom addons.

So, I don't know much about IIS, but I do know that you're not
currently using any of the "rewrite" functionality for IIS, because
you're using the 404 trick.

Basically, by redirecting 404's to WordPress, you're accomplishing a
cheap form of rewriting. That's why you can't get 404's to work,
because you're using them to redirect to the main site instead.

Uh, yes. Switching to Apache isn't an option at this stage :-)

I guess I'll keep plodding aliong. Hosting provider reckons they'll be  
able to upgrade me to IIS7 soon.

What I find strange is that WordPress processes all the existing pages  
as it should. Even when it is a non-existing URL WordPress detects  
this and start going through the 404.php file in the template.

It just never gets to finish. But, it fails in what seems a random  
fashion, almost as if it is a timeout of some sort.

Thank you all for the help and I'll continue the quest once I've been  
upgraded to IIS 7.

There are several scripts that do this on front end:
WP Minify
W3 Total Cache
Script Compressor
PHP Speedy
Autoptimize

Note that all of them have different features and give different results so
test results with tools like Live HTTP Headers extension for Firefox or
online tools http://www.webpagetest.org/test and
http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/ (check cache/expiry
headers and gziping, see what scripts are concatenated (you don't want to
include popular external files like Google Analytics, AdSense, Google Ajax
Libraries or other statistics, ads and similar files which are common and
are probably already cached on user's browser) and so on).

And tell us what you did!

I would say that the feed should contain the expanded HTML of the
short code and not the raw short code itself.  For XML-RPC though the
raw short code should be returned, not the expanded HTML.

I've written a small library for easy multiple loops which avoids
exactly these kinds of problems. I'll clean it up and see if I can get
it released next week.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Strange errors with the link checker
Message-ID: <4AA28AC4.9010005@gmail.com>

By default, WordPress generates something like the following URI to
reply to specific comments:

http://foo.org/blog/post/?replytocom=123456#respond

When I pass a page with comments through the W3C link checker, I see
errors like the following for each comment:

Some of the links to this resource point to broken URI fragments (such
as index.html#fragment).


1. Does anyone see why this happens? There is a <div id="respond"> on
the default page.
2. Is the #respond part of the replytocom link necessary?

Thanks,
Harish

Browsers seem to honor a name= fragments and whatever id= the same  
way. I don't think the w3 checker likes the latter. The fragment is  
only to scroll down the page to the comment box, and that behavior is  
not strictly required.

I'd say that providing the user with the convenience of having the
page scroll down is better than your page being 100% W3C valid.

That's a valid use. See:

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.2.3
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/#C_8

It is supposed to be case-sensitive... maybe there's mismatch in case  
between fragment identifier and ID that the browser ignores, but the  
validator catches? Or maybe the validator itself has a bug. Either  
way, it's valid.

Message-ID: <a21f8bf00909051843m639fa347j952fc8350871593f@mail.gmail.com>

I experimented with wp_schedule_event() on a site a short while ago,
without luck. I found another solution, but recently I noticed that my
Media Temple GPU usage has flagged the wp-cron.php on that site as
taking up about 25% of the total processing time for all my sites.

I used http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cron-view/, and sure
enough, my experiment has inadvertantly left a HUGE number of
scheduled events for that hook.

When I try to run wp_clear_scheduled_hook( 'my_hook' ), the page
doesn't seem to load. The site's running OK, but I really need a way
of clearing all these events out. I'm not sure if
wp_unschedule_event() is viable - and I've heard that
wp_clear_scheduled_hook() is just a wrapper for this anyway.

Thanks for any tips...

Are you passing an $args parameter with wp_clear_scheduled_hook()?
There's an outstanding bug that means hooks with parameters aren't
cleared with wp_clear_scheduled_hook(). See

My hook never took a parameter. Do I need to pass an empty $args array

You shouldn't have to, no. It looks like you've got so many events
scheduled for that hook that wp_clear_scheduled_hook() can't handle it
and that's why your page isn't loading.

If you really have got a giant number of events scheduled then your
only option might be to clear the 'cron' row from the wp_options table
in the database.

Assuming you're not worried about other scheduled tasks[1], you can  
simply delete the row in your wp_options table with the meta_key = cron.

Hello,

This probably is not the right list for this question, but its the best place
I can find to ask it at the moment.

I see on slashdot today an announcement of a new worm effecting most previous
versions of Wordpress. I maintain many Wordpress sites, most of which will be
potentially impacted. Most of these will not be easy upgrade candidates for a
variety of reasons. I am left to attempt to secure them without an easy
upgrade path. 

Now I just spent maybe 45 minutes trying to find out the technical details of
how this worm worms its way into WP so I can find an alternative solution
(hopefully). Well, I still don't know how it does what it does. I haven't a
clue. The only thing I find on wordress.org describes the situation in a
general way, and the only provided solution is to upgrade. 

Most of the sites I manage have strict .htaccess rules protecting wp-login and
wp-admin. Am I safe in these situations, I wonder? Maybe. Maybe not.

So I look to the wp.org security blog in hopes of details. I find 9 total
posts over a 4 year period. Not particularly inspiring. Obviously, the level
of detail I am looking for does not exist on wordpress.org. Or does it? Is
there a better place, a mailing list somewhere? RSS feed? Another blog? 

I love a lot of things about Wordpress, but an easy/fast way to get detailed
security information, at least more than "upgrade now", seems overly
difficult. Thx.

It seems obvious why you wouldn't get critical details for an unfixed
vulnerabillity like this.

If there was a security patch available, you would get that, instead of
"Upgrade now".

I never asked for, or expected a patch. What I am looking for, is details. If
no one knows how this thing works, that level of detail will have to suffice.
If they do know, then that information would be really useful. "Upgrade now"
is not helpful (to me, at least in some situations). And I don't expect people
on this list to have the answers handy, but thought someone here  might be
able to point me in the right direction. 

Do you write the wp.org security blog by any chance?

This bug was fixed in v2.8.3, and the new code of this version gives all  
the details anyone wants to know. Nothing to hide anymore.

> If there was a security patch available, you would get that, instead of

The main problem was: Registered users without any privileges could just  
add double slashes (//) into an URL to get some admin privileges (install  
plugins, mess up the database etc.).


So you have to forbid double slashes in all URLs. The .htaccess way would  
be:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]+\ /(([^/\ ]+/)*)/+([^\ ]*)
RewriteRule ^ /%1%3 [L,R=301]

But if you have neither Apache nor mod_rewrite, you may use a little  
plugin I wrote:
http://f.toscho.de/SingleSlash.zip

I described the problem en detail (and in German) here:
http://toscho.de/2009/wordpress-2-8-3-das-doppelslash-problem/

Be aware! This fixes really just the double slashes. I can?t and won?t  
guarantee that you?re secure with it. Make the upgrades nevertheless.

John, thanks so much for pasting the link to this ticket!

I lost a good few hours the other night trying to figure out why when i used
an $args array with multiple values, only the first value was being passed
to functions hooked onto the wp-cron event.

I wanna force WP login fron another DB, i use the externa DB
authentication plugin and this works smootly, but i wanna d one more
step, the blog header is coming from another system and there i get
the info if the user is logged to the other system, if so i wanna foce
the login letting the extern DB auth plugin check if the the user
exist in WP DB or copyng it locally.

This works if users log using WP login screen, i tried to use
wp_authentication command with login e password for externa
authentication btut looks like it doens't works.

Any idea how to foce login to WP passing loginn and password (and
letting the plugin intercep wp_authentication function that it plug
with tit's function) in a simple way?

wp-includes/pluggable.php should answer to it all.
overwrite some of that function with yours, and deal with your master

Subject: [wp-hackers] Making Updates Friendlier?
Message-ID: <4AA6B898.6030309@gunters.org>

In the aftermath of the recent WP worm, there has been the usual raft of 
FUD flying about. I won't bother pointing out any particular sources -- 
suffice to say that some of the recent posts about "WordPress Security" 
were reasonable, and many were not. It seems like every time there is 
some sort of security issue related to WordPress, regardless of the 
scope, it becomes a PR nightmare of sorts. Primarily, I think that it 
goes hand-in-hand with the popularity of WordPress: we are popular, 
therefore we are a high-profile target, and therefore when something 
goes wrong, it affects a lot of users, and therefore it gets a lot of 
attention. It's the nature of celebrity.

As has been pointed out time and time again, WordPress is easier than 
ever to keep updated. When a new version is released, a nag appears in 
the Dashboard. From there, it's just a couple of clicks to upgrade. And 
yet, people *still* lag behind. The reasons are varied, and _mostly_ 
invalid (depending on your perspective). Some of it is simply "fear of 
breaking something". Some of it is just simple stubbornness ("I just 
upgraded, I don't want to do it again so soon!"). Some of it might be 
ignorance and laziness (they see the nag, but don't look at the 
WordPress News blocks in the Dashboard, or go to the main site to read 
about it).

So, what more can we do? Not a *whole* lot, but I do have a suggestion:

In order to express the relative urgency of upgrade notices, I propose 
that we categorize upgrades into four priority levels:

  1. Minor Bugfixes
  2. Major Bugfixes
  3. New Feature Release
  4. Security Update

Each version release could be tagged accordingly, along with a brief 
description of the changes and/or impact. These priority levels could be 
used to style the update nag messages, and provide a sense of their 
relative importance (e.g. 1 = yellow, 2 = orange, 3 = green, 4 = 
REDOMGWTFBBQ). For bugfix releases, a brief, friendly message can be 
presented along the lines of "To find out if these issues might affect 
your site, visit [URL] for more details."

This information could be stored on the wordpress.org side, with a 
simple API update in the current version check functions.

Other notes: for a long time, people have requested the presentation of 
"patch releases" which only contain files which changed, rather than a 
full reinstall package. Personally, I don't mind the extra safety given 
by a full update, because it ensures that if any of my local files were 
modified without my knowledge, those changes would get overwritten. But 
then again, I update my site from the current svn branch nightly anyways.

I did see one comment over on WP Tavern which mentioned a pretty valid 
problem with updates[1]: In some corporate environments, all changes 
have to go through a multi-stage vetting process before being pushed out 
to production. Changes are put through testing/QA, and often maintained 
in a local source control system. Large-scale changes are *much* harder 
to push through such a system than small ones. It would be easy to point 
fingers and just say "your process is broken", but that isn't helpful. 
Providing an official "changes only" patchset *would* be helpful to such 
users, because the code which needed review would be more isolated. 
(Yes, they could go to Trac to see changes. Yes they should be able to 
diff against their local source control system. Yes, yes, yes. But I'm 
simplifying, and remember (to paraphrase) - individuals are smart, 
groups are dumb).

On a tangential note, a lot of people complain that occassionally 
WordPress upgrades "break plugins". I've pointed out before that 
typically, this is because the plugin author has taken a shortcut 
somewhere, and is mucking around with WP internals, instead of using an 
established API function which insulates them from changes in the guts 
of WP. But it's hard to get end-users to see it that way. From their 
perspective, it's simple: the plugin worked before the upgrade, and it 
was broken after. Therefore, the WP upgrade "broke" the plugin. You'll 
probably never convince them to look at it any other way. But I have to 
wonder if we can't try...something. I'm not sure what. But since this 
seems to be a large source of the FUD concerning upgrades, it certainly 
seems worth discussing it and kicking around some ideas on how to 
address it.

I like the idea of color coding the upgrading nag & I would also have to
second Dougal's paragraph on cooperate environments, of which we're running
to a scenario that's pretty close to the one he listed - having something
that would smooth the process out a little more than looking at Trac or
looking at the diff between files/folders would be
nice (still thinking about what a good solution would be though).

All my Wordpress installs now use this directory structure:

/index.php
/cms/wordpress/
/cms/wp-config.php
/cms/wp-content/

This makes updates and backups on shared hosting a doddle, including  
systems with no SSH access, no CP, or reduced PHP privileges blocking  
auto-updates.

But I can guarantee that I'll have at least two plugins in each  
install which have had to be hacked to understand the 'unconventional'  
directory structure, although it is legitimate and supported by  
Wordpress.

So I update Wordpress core, but now I need to update the plugins. Do I  
need to hack the plugins all over again? Which ones did I hack? How  
many lines did I change?* What's different in the new plugin? And some  
plugins will have a style dir or other custom content inside the  
plugin dir, and suddenly my pain free upgrade for multiple sites isn't  
looking so straightforward.

So, for me, good documentation for plugin developers on how to address  
wp-content and wp-config.php - wherever they are - including sample  
code or drop-in function is essential. You wouldn't believe the  
variety of startling solutions folks are coming up with in its absence.

Oh, and some strongly worded advice about the benefits of storing  
custom plugin data outside the plugin dir too.

*Yes, I realise I ought to keep changelogs of my own for every site -  
I'm trying.

I had a thought. The only way to save the user from himself--short of
educating him--is to automate. Automating a safe upgrade begins with
knowing how to do it manually. Before upgrading a site you must see
that it works as-is. Then you must upgrade the site (preferably a
copy) and see whether it works. The baseline for what's working is
whatever passes your test. Or a test suite. Uh oh, unit tests.

So if you are to really fix the problem of broken-after-upgrade you
must have tests to run and compare before and after, a copy of the
site, and something smart to do when a test fails. Code not covered by
tests (plugins and themes) would be troublesome but not fatal; process
of elimination is valid intelligence gathering. Tests for plugins and
themes should be supplied by their authors, which is a cultural shift
that will meet resistance proportional to the size of the Extend
repositories.

The size of the WordPress repository is also daunting but it needn't
all have test cases from the start. It could be begun with just one
simple test case and grow from there: does index.php produce 200
OK...</head>?

The other way would be to toss the old plugin and theme systems and
write new ones that encapsulated non-core code and enforced nice play.
That would be great for the ivory tower set but not so much for folks
entrenched like most of us are.

My bad. The behaviour is indeed as above, on second look i.e., feed  
has shortcodes expanded and XML-RPC does not. Which I agree is the way  
it should be. Back to my other two issues:

a) Why a <br /> tag at the end of lines within the shortcode? Is this  
wpautop() doing this? Is that a bug?

b) Any suggestions on how I might be able to retain the shortcode in  
the text (in the DB, so that the shortcode content can be edited  
later) but have it expanded in the XML-RPC interface? I suppose I  
would need to use actions in a plug-in (not my theme) to accomplish  
this, if at all. Any pointers on the actions/filters I should be  
looking at?

Thank you,

Another thought that has been discussed is:

Make the update process safe and reversible.

Provide the user with the tools to upgrade and downgrade the site at  
will so they can go back if something is broken.

This includes db and plugin up/downgrading.

Also integrate information into the pre-upgrade step to check for  
plugin compatibility based on crowd-sourced data - i.e. not just rely  
on plugin authors marking a version as supported but let the community  
provide that information.

Sorry for the top post -- iPhone makes bottom-posting a real pain.

How about building an easy "back out" procedure into the core upgrade?
Back up the db, copy all core files to a safe tmp and then upgrade.
Things not working? Create a dialog like Apple's crash reporter and
have the users send feedback to WP along with a generated list of
plugins and their versions. Maybe even have the crash receiver be able
to respond with "version 3.14 of Plugin X us known not to work with
the newest WP. Please contact the author (insert author contact from
plugin description here)."

Remove as many speesbumps as possible. And yes, absolutely color code
the alerts. *grin*

A few ideas as well.

I think the current "there's a new WP version out" nag is not big enough. 
I've seen it real life: it doesn't pass the wife test, she simply does not 
pay attention to it, and when asked about it, she goes "oh yeah, didn't 
see it, thanks!"

Why not make it bigger? Something like a once per day lightbox popup, with 
"Close, thanks, I'll see later" and "Please upgrade now" buttons.

On the "WP upgrade broke my site", it's obviously 98% FUD and 0.5% of 
people who indeed experienced problems. Since there have been a few of 
them lately, why not make a poll about upgrading and let people express 
themselves? How many people upgrade with absolutely no fear? How many are 
a bit shaky but eventually it all goes fine? How many really had troubles 
with the recent releases?*

Cheers

Ozh

[*] such a poll should imo let 2.3 out of the scope because this release 
did break a number of themes because of the new DB schema & taxonomy 
functions.

Monday morning I blogged two suggestions:

1) Have WordPress send an email to the blog's admin users once a day 
when there is an update available.

2) Have WordPress slowly deactivate itself over time as the version 
gets older and older.

Hah. Good luck with suggestion #2.

However, Emailing when a Plugin/Core/Theme upgrade becomes available is  
something I do agree would be good. I think theres a plugin which does  
exactly this.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/zes-admin-update-notification/ is the  
first one i found, But i'm certain theres others (And someone else just  
mailed saying they made one a few days ago.. )

I also noticed on a download site for a application the other day "Enter  
your email here and click Download to register for security-update  
emails".. Seemed like a good way of telling users that updates were  
available to me. (However, Wouldnt really fit WordPress i dont think,  
Feels too spammy, Better the blog doing it)

If you go to http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ you'll see that the most
popular plugin is xpress <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xpress/>.

It seems like the sorting algorhythm doesn't take ratings into account.

I've seen that mentioned twice so far...
...Except that i cant see xpress mentioned on either the Extend homepage,  
or the first handful of Popular pages...

What am i missing?

My other email still stands.. I couldnt see it last time either..

Strange that its been removed though.. I've seen that plugin plenty of  
times, and was nothing dodgy :) (Other than supporting a lot of porn site

I've self-witnessed real problems that really occured after upgrading
from 2.7.1 to 2.8. It included broken interface features all over the
backend and multitude of malfunctioning plugins. Owner of the blog -
regular user, being very far from IT in general,  was feeling stressed
and depressed all day long while reasons of malfunctioning were
tracked and corrected. I should say that it never resolved properly,
so the only solution to that problem was degrading back to 2.7.1.
Which we did together. But now, after all security issues, that is not
an alternative anymore.

That arises another question by the way. Why there shouldn't be a way
to easily patch 2.7.1 (on ordinary users level), since most part of
bug fixes are pretty compatible with it?

So I vote for "upgrade" categorization and more flexible upgrade
process (abillity to roll back easily for example).

Something dodgy was happening. We noticed it at the top of the plugin
listings yesterday, with 175,000+ downloads in 1 day (from a previous

somebody was gaming the listings.

This is something the Drupal world gets right, IMO. Lots of security  
information consolidated here: http://drupal.org/security also  
available as RSS feeds and ALSO available as email. I subscribed to  
the emails for a while and was really impressed that they covered not  
just core but issues with 3rd party Drupal modules as well.  This kind  
of thing could have a huge security benefit for WP.

Not sure who's in charge of it but WP's updates email list is
completely desolate most of the time. It should have strongly worded
terrifying emails when there are security updates. As it is its pretty
neglected, and IMHO the dashboard feed just doesn't replace it. Lots
of people use WP casually, and the once or twice a month they log in
they don't have time to read everything on the dashboard.

IMHO telling people to sign up when downloading is not too spammy, its
realistic. The fact is that when you get entangled with WP you are
signing up for a security problem, and telling people to sign up to a
list about security updates is a good way to let them know that they
NEED security updates. Giving out wordpress without telling people
there's a security risk is like giving out Windows without any
anti-virus software: very misleading and dangerous.

This is a good point. When was the last time that the 'wp-announce' 
mailing list was actually used to notify people of a new WP version? I 
can't find the archives, and I sure can't remember it happening anytime 
recently. I vaguely recall Matt sending *something* to the announce list 
a few versions back, but I'd probably have to grep through a few 
gigabytes of old emails to find it.

I think it would be great if part of the installation procedure for a 
new WordPress site was to add a checkbox (checked by default) prompting 
the user to opt-in to the wp-announce mailing list. This would be on the 
same screen that asks for the initial administrator email address. It 
could give a short message explaining that the mailing list is very low 
volume (typically less than one message per month), it will only be used 
to send important update information, and that the email address will 
not be shared with third-parties (etc.).

Then (and this is the key), actually USE the wp-announce mailing list 
for what it's there for. Make it part of the standard procedure 
checklist for new releases. In fact, there should probably be an 
announcement at the first Beta and Release Candidate milestones, as well 
(not every interim beta and rc, just the initial "hey, we're beta 
testing, you might want to start your own tests to get ready for the new 
version", and "hey, we've reached release candidate stage, things should 
be pretty stable, and we're trying to knock out the last few bugs before 
official release").

AND, when a security issue becomes known, an announcement should be 
made, as well. I know that opinions vary on exactly *when* security 
issues should be announced: as soon as known -- even before a patch is 
available, or only after a patch is ready for the public? I don't think 
this is the time or place for that discussion, but I think making the 
announcements by email as well as via the dev blog (and thus the 
dashboard news) is important. I think there are more people than we 
might think who hardly glance at the dashboard. Maybe the news blocks in 
their dashboard are just "below the fold" and they don't see it. Maybe 
they actively ignore it (do a search for "dashboard" in the plugin 
repository and take note of how many mention turning off the news 
feeds). Maybe they're just old-school and prefer email, and miss the 
days of Usenet. Whatever the case, I think that adding email 
announcements has got to be a Good Thing. And it could pretty easily be 
automated. Just set up the Dev Blog to relay any posts made in the 
"Announcements" category, or something like that.

(And BTW, I think there are a lot of things that the WordPress and 
Drupal communities can learn from each other. Both have a lot of good 
points to them that the other could borrow. I might have a blog post 
about that later, if I can find the time.)

Note that if you want to stay compatible with exports from WordPress  
you can't use an XML (and hence RSS) parser, as some exports from WP  
are not well-formed XML.

I tried to read past discussions on this to make sure that I wasn't
repeating anything that has already been said. That said, I'm thinking that
the wp-announce mailing list might not be the best way to do this, at least
not in a format similar to the wp-hackers/wp-docs mailing lists. I'd like to
see something clean and presentable to the public, more "newsletter" than
"mailing list," if that distinction makes sense. I'm thinking of Apple's
product announcement emails and how they're short and to the point but also
informative. Something like that might benefit the average user of Wordpress
(I'm assuming here that the average user is the real target since the more
advanced user will likely have already heard about and applied the update).
I'm in favor, therefore, of the option during installation to sign up to
receive updates of new releases. I also agree with Dougal that it should be
opt-out rather than opt-in, increasing the likelihood that novice users will
check to receive updates.

Also (and now we're getting more complex), I'm wondering if there shouldn't
be some sort of check after an arbitrary number of days/weeks to make sure
that the Wordpress administrator has in fact installed the latest version.
I'm thinking that in addition to that (somewhat useless) bar on the top of
the admin screen, WP should check 2 weeks after any release to see if the
latest version is being used. If it's not, the administrator would receive
an email saying something to the effect of, "You still haven't updated!" You
get my drift.

Just some thoughts I'm throwing out there.

From wp-hackers at striderweb.com  Wed Sep  9 21:35:20 2009
From: wp-hackers at striderweb.com (Stephen Rider)
Date: Wed, 9 Sep 2009 16:35:20 -0500
Subject: [wp-hackers] wp-config.php, wp-load.php, and ABSPATH
Message-ID: <878933FE-8C92-4D22-82A2-7DECEFE0CFA7@striderweb.com>

Hackers --

As of WP 2.6, users have been able to move the wp-config.php file up  
on directory if they choose.  In my opinion this was an excellent  
change, because it is the final piece in allowing users to completely  
remove customizations from within the WordPress directory.  (Allowing  
moving wp-config being a significant piece of the same process).

There is a remnant of the old system still in wp-config.php, the  
directive to create ABSPATH if it does not exist.  I'm not sure why  
this is there -- perhaps it is a holdover of a much older version of  
WP.  But if wp-config.php is movable, then this code is no longer  
stable, and it's *existence* has encouraged a poor coding practice  
among plugin authors.

A problem that arises is plugins that do sort of "stand alone" things  
but want to access the database -- a common thing to do is to call wp- 
config.php directly to get the login info, rather than wp-load.php.   
Again, this is unstable because wp-config.php may have moved, and even  
if the plugin correctly knows to look up a directory, it will get  
tripped up if it then tries to call another file and bases the path  
off of ABSPATH.

While plugin authors *can* just call wp-load.php, which is safer and  
more stable, it appears to be quite common to do it the other way.

Here is my proposal: We should assert, in documentation and in code,  
that any time a plugin or process wants to access parts of WP  
(including the database), it should call wp-load.php.  We should do  
this via changes within the Codex, and inline documentation, and we  
should also do this by eliminating the ABSPATH define() in wp- 
config.php.

At the very least, we should put a "deprecated" call with the define()  
in wp-config, so that if it does happen, there is a notice to the log  
that "You should not call wp-config.php directly.  Call wp-load.php  
instead."  Then a version or two down the road we can get rid of the  
troublesome define.

What think ye?

Stephen

P.S. -- Why yes, I do get troubleshooting questions about this.  Why  
do you ask?

Message-ID: <349fe48b0909091631l7f31f22dr6cd95e489ddcc57e@mail.gmail.com>

A new ticket on trac contends that TinyMCE should use predefined classes
instead of inline styles: #10753<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10753>

The main drawback is that it would require themes to add these predefined
styles to their stylesheet, beside the classical .alignleft, .aligncenter
and .alignright

This is my proposed solution:

Instead of relying on each theme developer, make a default.css file and add
it through 'wp_head'.

- fixes the inline styles in TinyMCE
- potentially fixes inline styles generated by [gallery]
- themers can disable it if they wish

What do you think?

+1 for me, as a theme designer. This would definitely be more convenient
than the alternatives that are being used now.

Personally, I'd disable it, then call it using @import from the style.css
file, but just having it available would be killer, regardless of how I
chose to call it. And having it get called by default solves a lot of issues
like the one you mentioned.

This is not backwards compatible though.  Existing themes would  
suddenly not look right.

+1 for a default CSS hooked through wp-head

+1 for this - good idea!
In my theme development I'd disable it in wp_head and either import it in
styles.css or include the necessary styling directly with the rest of the
styling.

The ability to easily remove it from wp_head is important.

Does anyone have any ideas why when I output two page lists on the same page
(as in the attached text file) one list is hierarchical (the left one) and
the other is not (the right one)?

I can swap the meta_values over (i.e. left to right and vice versa) and it
still does the same thing - the left side is hierarchical and the right side
is not - it doesn't matter what the content is.

Its not a CSS issue either. It has me stumped.

Sure.

The hierarchy is supposed to be:

Childre / Parenting
-> Custody / Visitation
-> Paternity

When I set the above pages to be "left" they look fine (
http://findingsimple.com/dev/picture-3.png) but when I set them to the right
they lose the hierarchy :-S (http://findingsimple.com/dev/picture-5.png)

Message-ID: <67dfa4090909100617h5a573ba1y5f4eab395019aa9a@mail.gmail.com>

hi :)
Sometimes on my blog someone will publish post with Custom field name =
"video" and value = [url to video at YT]

I want that thos post will have added automatically blog tag 'video'

How to do this?

I just know that i need to add action hook for 'publish_post'. but what
should be in function? does wp has some function to add tag to post (i
belive yes, but i don't know which one)?

We'd had this basic discussion before.

Short answer is that plugins should not do that.

Long answer is that plugins that want to do "stand alone" sort of
things need to stop thinking they are stand alone and work within the
WordPress framework. We have hooks for most types of things (AJAX
calls and such) and we have methods to do other types of things
(template overload hooks), and those methods all work through the
framework. Thus, they have WordPress loaded, and you don't need to
include squat.

In conclusion, if you make your output directly call a separate file
in your plugin, and that file needs access to the database, then
*you're doing it wrong*. You can do it within the framework, and it's
generally much easier.

Give me a specific example, and I'll be glad to tell you the "right"
way that example should work. :)

Hi Otto --

You're missing the point.  All I'm trying to do is get the ABSPATH  
define removed from wp-config.php.  Reasons are:

a) it's obsolete
b) it encourages plugin coders to do it wrong (by your own definition).

Okay, I was citing loading wp-load.php as "better", but I agree that  
they're both *wrong*.

So do you concur that it would be a good idea to get rid of the  
ABSPATH define() in wp-config.php ?  :-)

Stephen

wp_add_post_tags($post_id = 0, $tags = '')

Example:
wp_add_post_tags(12345, 'video, another-tag, whatever');

No. It's going to break a lot of plugins and add some fuel to the "WP

So, you're asking if we should instantly and intentionally break every
plugin that includes wp-config.php?

Yeah, I'm fine with it. ;)

I made a comment to that ticket, but I thought I would make it here as  
well.

It's a great idea, but before it gets set in stone I would really like  
to see some better CSS naming conventions for the HTML objects  
WordPress creates. There is no coding standard for CSS like there is  
for PHP in WordPress, so here's the type of things we get:

For an attachment starting div id is attachment_13 with classes wp- 
caption and alignleft wrapped around an img with classes size-medium  
wp-image-13 and a p with class wp-caption-text. It's not bad but there  
are dashes, underscores, compounded words, and very little to help you  
predict the sort of CSS that WordPress is going to spit out. Of course  
object oriented CSS approaches were the techniques aren't being used.  
It's getting better, but don't go look at the some of the buddypress  
CSS names (it burns!).

If WordPress adds some removable default css for these objects then  
some better naming conventions for the CSS classes and ids would  
really help. Especially some prefix that says "This came from  
WordPress" like a wp-gallery, wp-attachment, or something else parse- 
able used in CSS ids and classes.

Is your code missing an outer <ul> and </ul> on the right hand side? I
couldn't reproduce your problem and without an outer unordered list
it'd probably look like that.

Is the CSS the same for the classes library-list-left and
library-list-right? Also, what does the HTML look like in the output?

I am unable to reproduce as well.

I like the idea, but the execution would be painful. Every time we try
to standardize something in this way, we end up having lots of
backward compatibility for several versions, in order to get
theme/plugin devs the time to fix their stuff. And then we still end
up breaking things.

In going forward, lets keep this sort of thing in mind, and make
everything start with something obvious, like wp- for classes and
such.

But the ones we've already got let's just leave alone, for now.
Changing them will break sites. Adding new ones to replace them just
adds worthless cruft that never gets cleaned up properly, and still
will break sites.

Too true. Shame on me (or others :P)  for not noticing or thinking  
about mentioning this sooner. These sort of things can also be  
corrected when those areas go though major revamps or rewrites that  
will break stuff anyway.

Html output and code here

Yeah it has me absolutely stumped. I am using wp_list_page elsewhere on the
site and it is working fine.

Hello all,

please point me elsewhere with suitable derision if this is the wrong  
forum to ask. Hoping its not:

Does WP's new update capability (for plugins and themes) blow away the  
existing directory before it installs the new version of the plugin or  
theme? If so, if a theme wants (or more likely it's author wants) to  
create some files (such as a custom stylesheet), what's a good place  
to put it so it doesn't get blown away on update? The DB would be a  
poor place, IMHO.

Thank you for any comments,

This has been much discussed, without much of a consensus.   Please
see the thread that starts here:
http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-February/024728.html

In my opinion, your best option currently is to save something like
that in the uploads directory.

You could probably just make a "Child Theme".

For a user-supplied CSS then a child theme is the way to go,
If its however a theme-generated content item, better location is  
wp-content/ or the uploads folder.

The uploads folder is the only location you can trust to be writable  
really too, the fact that some (if not most) shared hosts allow PHP to  
write to its current directory cannot be relied upon.

Well, like I said, my problem with that is that you shouldn't do the
other one either.

If you wanted to put something in there like "you shouldn't include
this file directly, go read this documentation for the right way
instead" then I'd be more okay with it.

I'm actually encountering this right now ... I'm making a call to:

'../../../../wp-load.php'

... from within a subdirectory of my plugin directory.  Obviously, if
someone has chosen to move wp-content elsewhere, this breaks.  So,
here's a specific example Otto.  ;)

What I'm doing is exporting data from my plugin's DB tables into a CSV
file from the admin. I can't have any other output to the browser so I
can set proper headers for the file.

Any ideas as to how I can achieve this from strictly within the WP
framework?

Best,
Derek

Perhaps one of the best solutions is using admin-ajax.php.

Take a look at the source, and you will quickly find out how easy it
is to use and how to use it.

Message-ID: <f8f68a600909111217l15c83b9co86296ec38292e65a@mail.gmail.com>

Created a custom template and placed it in a sub-directory of my theme.
When I look at the template list on Add New Page, my custom template is
listed (only seems to work one folder level back).  However, WP uses
Page.php (in theme root), instead of my custom template.

Is this a bug in WP or am I missing something?

admin-post.php would be better suited IMO

wp-admin/admin-post.php?action=myplugin_export_db

add_action('admin_post_myplugin_export_db', 'my_plugin_export_the_db_now');
function my_plugin_export_the_db_now() {
    echo 'Hello World!';
}

If the user isnt logged in, The hook fired is

admin_post_nopriv_myplugin_export_db

So its possible to differentiate between a logged in user, and one that  
has either not been logged in, or more likely, who's admin session has  
expired.

Also, Don't forget the nonce proetection on such a URL..

You can use admin-ajax.php, I just prefer to seeadmin-post.php used for  
everything other than Ajaxy things myself..

Message-ID: <485dd1460909120455x2398a728m2616292876aae861@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I need to know if there is a built-in function (or recommended way) to
retrieve the post id of a page/post based on the post title, without
querying the database directly.

I know it can be done by querying the database, but I prefer to use the
build-in function if available. A quick look into WordPress code, didn't
reveal any function.

Thanks!

With Regards,
Sudar

There's a get_page_by_title, modify it to use with posts, in fact, it  
should probably be modified within core?

Joost,

Thanks for pointing out this function. (I missed it when I looked into
WordPress code)

I had a quick look into the function and it is using the following query

SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_title = %s AND post_type='page'",
$page_title )

If post revisions is enabled, and there is a auto-save version available
will it not get the id of the revision post row rather than the one which
was published?

My gut feeling says that we should also include the condition post_status =
'published'. Am I correct or am I missing something?

(I will do some test to find out whether my theory works!)

With Regards,
Sudar

All,

Thank you for the responses -- I should have checked the archives,  
since the discussion seems to have been extensive. If indeed the theme  
directory is to be wiped, then I am leaning towards storing persistent  
files in wp_contents rather than uploads (despite the caution that  
only uploads is guaranteed to be writeable). The suggestion of a  
"child theme" is a valuable one too. Again, thank you,

Generally it?s preferred you post on the forums first. but for a
slightly more technical question, such as yours, you?re more likely to
get some sort of answer. This is because if nobody can immediately
answer your question in the forums, it unfortunately tends to get
ignored, rather than a constructive response.

Hi all,

(Sorry for digging the old thread)

Ozh solution is nice, but it will get triggered every time any theme is
activated. I wanted to trigger a function only when my theme is triggered.
Is it possible to do that?

With Regards,
Sudar

your theme's functions.php will only load when it is the active theme, so
Ozh's solution will only trigger when your theme is activated.

Hello all,

I digged a little deeper into the code and found that there is a discrepancy
in the way page templates are handled. (I checked WordPress 2.8.4 code)

First in the write page and edit page admin pages, the list of page
templates is retrieved using the get_themes() function in
wp-include/theme.php file. In this function, we are iterating in the current
directory and all sub directory to get template files. So if I place a
page-template file inside a sub directory (single level) then it will be
displayed in the admin pages.

When the page is rendered, locate_template() function again from
wp-include/theme.php file is invoked. In this function, we are checking for
the page template only from the theme's directory and not in sub-directory.
So by default the page.php template will be used.

This is surely a bug, but I am not sure where the fix should go. Placing
page-template files in a separate directory could be handy. In that case we
might have to modify locate_template() function.

With Regards,
Sudar

I would think that the meta value inserted in the database should be
the path relative to the theme directory.

So something like:  my-sub-dir/my-page-template.php

Yeah, if the inserted meta value is my-sub-dir/my-page-template.php then it
should solve the problem.

If anyone else, (apart from me) is able to replicate the issue, then I will
open a ticket.

Message-ID: <67dfa4090909141230y610a2d3qd1f4ca583e9452@mail.gmail.com>

hello :)
I am this guy who created few days ago plugin to notify by email if new
version of wordpress is available.
http://www.muzungu.pl/moje-pluginy-do-wordpressa/upgrade-notification-by-email/

in many places (eg http://www.wptavern.com/upgrade-notifications-by-email )
you suggest me to use function wp_version_check() but i don't know how to do
this :(

i found its description in update.php file but i still dont know how to use
it. i see that i return false or null. ok, but what it returns else?

could anyone axplain me how to check if new version of wordpress is
available using this function and if it is available perform some action
(for example print "is available")?

i tried to use this function in template file footer.php. i putted there:

<?php  if (wp_version_check()) { print "OK"; } else {print "not ok"; }   ?>

and it prints "not ok" at wordpress 2.8.1 and at 2.8.4. so result is thesame
on not actual and actual version of wordpress :(

wp_version_check() performs the version check, and then sets the
update_core transient if there's a new version. It doesn't return
anything of value.

Basically, WordPress checks for updates all by itself. All you have to
do is to do a get_transient( 'update_core' ) and then, when it
changes, it'll have information about a new version in it which you
can use to send the email.

Subject: [wp-hackers] how to use wp_version_check() function?

ooook :) so now i understand :) so if i want to check which version i have,
i need to do this piece of code:
// it takes all information:
$update_core = get_transient('update_core');
// it takes information sent from wordpress server:
$za = $update_core->updates;
// it takes information about version with locale same as out (eg pl_PL)
$zb = $za[0];
// and it takes info which version we have comparing to server version
$zm = $zb->response;
// return: "latest" for latest, "upgrade" if we have too old version and
"development" if we have for example wordpress 12.4.2 ;)
echo $zm;

it's not a question :) i checked and it works, but i wrote those obvious
things for people who will google this email ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] <del> vs <span style="text-decoration:line-through">
Message-ID: <1fa535a70909141605w508db36y7fe3b5dff070597b@mail.gmail.com>

I've just noticed that the Strikethrough button in TinyMCE doesn't use
the <del> tag as one might expect. It instead uses <span
style="text-decoration:line-through">. However, when using HTML mode
in the editor, a <del> tag is used, complete with a datetime
attribute.

Surely the <del> tag is the more semantic option? Any opinions?

Not sure if this is WP-specific or a TinyMCE thing, I've not looked
into the code yet.

John.

They have indeed moved.

You can always check the email headers as the link is in there or
http://lists.automattic.com/ and click on your list and then the

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding javascript code after script is enqueued
Message-ID: <9b6c20460909142037m7d040562uedb905c870da5c7f@mail.gmail.com>

Is there way to add javascript code immediately after script is enqueued? I
found function wp_localize_script, but it adds code before script enqueuing.

I am asking this because of following problem. jQuery file included in
WordPress is different from official one in that it has jQuery.noConflict at
it end. If we use jQuery from Google AJAX Libraries, there is noconflict so
we need to add it.

Author of plugin Use Google Libraries (which enables use of files from
Google?s servers) solved this by enqueuing file jQnc.js (which whole content
is jQuery.noConflict(); ) . It is lightweight but it needs another request
and headers could be up to kilobyte.

It would be better if noConflict code is added in html of page, it will not
increase page size, but it will remove one request. I asked Jason could he
enable this but he said that he is not aware of way to do this with WP API.

So, does anyone knows solution for this?

Thanks

Okay then, here's an example that probably comes up a lot in plugins.

I want to make a CSS file that gets some of its stuff from PHP.  So  
"mystyles.css.php".  Most of it is a simple echo, but a few things in  
the stylesheet are pulled from settings on the wp_settings table in  
the database.

The CSS/PHP file is pulled directly by the browser and is thus not "WP  
Aware".  How would I get that file to access the WP database?

Stephen

P.S. -- Also, if we're going to encourage coders to do it the right  
way, examples such as this would be a good idea to put into the  
Codex. :-)

Short answer: you can't. Best option is to add a normal stylesheet and 
then output any bits that depend on the db in a <style> tag after that. 
This way WordPress won't run twice on each page load (once to generate 
the HTML, second time to generate the stylesheet).

Hi,
I think, you can?

i try this:
- create style.css.php

-embed new styles
- style.css:
	@import url(style.css.php);

- style.css.php:

<?php
require_once("../../../wp-blog-header.php");
header("Content-type: text/css");
?>
@charset '<?php bloginfo('charset') ?>';

#header:after,
.header:after {
	content:'<?php bloginfo('name'); ?>'
}

I don't now if there are any problems with caching, but you can read  
this article on smashingmagazine about php and css. Maybee it will  
help you.

hi
I test myself how behave api of wordpress for checking upgrades.

when type in browser url bar:
http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.3/?version=2.8.4&php=5.0&locale=en_US&mysql=5.0

it says that i have latest wp version.

but when i change locale to polish:

http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.3/?version=2.8.4&php=5.0&locale=pl_PL&mysql=5.0

it says that i have to upgrade but also shows me that newest is 2.8.4
pl_PL.

why? is it a bug?

also i found report with thesame problem (with function apply_filters(
'core_version_check_locale', get_locale() ); which is used in
wp_version_check) at forum
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/302577?replies=2

api says something bad if locale is different than en_US

That still loads WordPress Twice for every  request, And doesnt work for a  
custom WP_CONTENT_DIR

Best method is a normal Style.css file, and:
add_action('wp_head', 'custom_css');
function custom_css() {
echo '<style>';
echo '.textColor1 { color:' . get_option('theme_colour1') . '; }';
echo '.textColor2 { color:' . get_option('theme_colour2') . '; }';
....
echo '</style>';
}

Remember, that you can have multiple .class's , ie.
style.css:
.textColor1 {
font-weight: bold;
}

and the above code, End result is that you get bolded coloured text.

The Monotone theme is the first theme which comes to mind which shows that  
system in use.

Thats what the Local Package var is for.

Ie:
http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.3/?version=2.8.4&php=5.0&locale=pl_PL&mysql=5.0&local_package=pl_PL

What that API result is telling you, Is that pl_PT 2.8.4 is available,  
Whilst you are running en_US version (as no local_package is set) with the  
WPLANG set to pl_PT

Yes, the del tag is the way to go. It has a purpose that is more than 
just putting a line through text. See here:

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#h-9.4

My guess is that TinyMCE went with the span tag before all the major 
browsers supported the del tag, but the major browsers have supported it 
for a while now (not all its attributes are supported by all of them 
yet, but they all at least render it).

You can tell the server to interpret the CSS file as a normal PHP file. You
do that in .htaccess, but I can't remember now the exactly sintax. Google
will tell you in no time though!

When your server thinks the CSS is a PHP you can write PHP code as usually
and the file will still be a .css WP Aware, like you need it to be.

Just remember to tell the browser that the file content is a CSS, with
header() function as the first line, before anything was sent to the
browser, like this:

<?php

header('Content-type: text/css');

Get it?

Okay, that's kind of what I thought, and that's what I'm doing (okay,  
in my actual case it's a JavaScript into which I'm passing variables,  
but same principle).

What got me thinking about this is that lately every time I turn  
around I've got some WP article or whatnot telling me I really really  
really ought to be using the wp-enqueue functions, and that I'm  
basically doing something wrong if I don't use them.  But using them  
there's no way to connect them to info from the database, **except**  
for direct-loading wp-head.php or wp-config.php (or some other file  
I'm not supposed to direct-load).

Soo... either do the "wrong" thing by not using enqueue, or do the  
"wrong" thing by direct-loading wp-config.php.   I don't personally  
see any harm in bypassing enqueue in such cases, but there are some  
seriously mixed signals going on....  :-\

There's another half baked solution

Instead of including wp-config.php in your custom.css.php and fire WP a 
second time, you can simply pass a number of parameters you need in your 
CSS

Something like
$options = get_option('my_plugin');
$color1 = $options['color1'];
$color2 = $options['color2'];
$width = $options['width'];
wp_enqueue_script('my_plugin', 
$path."/custom.css.php?color1=$color1&etc..");

Depending on how many variables the custom CSS needs to know this can be 
easier to do

Wow. Everybody else got that one wrong too. :)

The right way is to not load "styles.css.php" directly in the first
place. If you need to load the WordPress files, then you should load
WordPress itself, and direct it to do what you want it to do.

If you want to make some kind of output outside the normal "flow" of
WordPress, but need the WordPress functions to do it:

First, realize that WordPress is going to load twice anyway. The goal
is not to eliminate this (if you need wpdb access in your separate
file, then you sorta have to do load WP again), but to eliminate the
need to know the WordPress file paths and such.

Example code:
function plugin_query_vars($public_query_vars) {
	$public_query_vars[] = 'SOME_IDENTIFIER';
	return $public_query_vars;
}
function plugin_special_output() {
	if(intval(get_query_var('SOME_IDENTIFIER')) == 1) {
		// do whatever output you like here
		exit; // stop normal WordPress execution
	}
}
add_filter('query_vars', 'plugin_query_vars');
add_action('template_redirect', 'plugin_special_output');


After you add this code, a call to any normal WordPress URL with
?SOME_IDENTIFIER=1 stuck on the end will return your code instead.
That code can be *anything*. If you want to output CSS, output CSS.
Change the headers if you like. Whatever.

Interesting solution. It sort of solves the two wrongs: using
wp_enquee and not loading WP twice.

But then again, I don't think it has any performance advantage over
just putting the CSS in the head. I guess it depends on how dynamic it
is.

So, Steven, guidelines are meant to be ignored sometimes, imo. :-)

    }

}
add_action( 'wp', 'my_jquery_test', 0 );

    function my_print_head_scripts() {

        wp_print_head_scripts();

        my_print_scripts_finish( $rest );

    function my_print_footer_scripts() {
        $rest = my_print_scripts_prep();

        wp_print_footer_scripts();

        my_print_scripts_finish( $rest );

        wp_print_footer_scripts();
    }

    function my_print_scripts_prep() {
        global $wp_scripts;

        $offset = array_search( 'jquery', $wp_scripts->queue );

        $rest = array_slice( $wp_scripts->queue, $offset );

        $wp_scripts->print_html = "<script

This method is the easiest way i could think of to get the noconflict to
load directly after the jquery script (in case other scripts that depend
upon it are also enqueued for the same spot). The hooks provided in this
process do not allow for any other simpler approaches i could think up at
this time.

Another possible approach is to create your own version of the
wp-admin/load-scripts.php script concatenator.

Subject: [wp-hackers] meta box and input field seem not to work on writing
	post/page
Message-ID: <4AB0B6E2.1010803@eetanet.fi>

This is my first message in here so sorry if you have allready covered 
add_meta_box() ( 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_meta_box ) function 
and usage in here and picking up PUT/GET http commands on post/page 
writing page.

I am fidling around with posts and pages meta box. It seems that I 
cannot get <input type="hidden" ....> to work right. I have googled and 
searched around and it seems that I am doing something totally wrong. 
Does anybody have an idea where I am doing stuff wrong. Here is a simple 
"Hello World" plugin to illustrate the problem. It seems that wordpress 
is messing around in writing post/page the $_REQUEST['hellomessage'] and 
$_POST['hellomessage'] variables(this might not be the correct term).

How the sample plugin works:
It first creates the meta box by adding metboxHook to wordpress 
'admin_menu' hook and creates meta_box to posts side panel. The sample 
plugin should send (pushing the update post button) to server(http POST) 
hellomessage which is first echo:ed out by $_POST and after that with 
$_REQUEST (just for testing). So basicly in the metabox there should 
became text "Hello World" after submitting editing post. It seems not to 
work and I am totally clueless what I am doing wrong.

Anyone know if there would happen to be any other lists dedicated to
Wordpress similar to this one? I find that I often have questions on styling
and customization and haven't had any luck in the WP forums. Since those
questions don't involve hacking per say I choose not to post them here.

Any responses appreciated.

I am honestly not familiar with any lists that provide that type of
help.  Users are normally pointed to the forums at
http://wordpress.org/support/

The full list of lists can be found at

An interesting technique, and something I  will definitely file for  
future reference, but not really appropriate for the CSS example I  
gave.  Is it really the *best* way to have to have a bunch of GET  
string attached to every page of a site just to customize some CSS???   
Talk about ugly URLS for such a minor thing.

I think the best is to simply output the custom CSS to wp-head.

Question:  Do enqueued CSS or scripts come specifically before or  
after wp-head output?  Is it ***definitive*** or does it depend on the  
theme?

Stephen

P.S. -- In all of this, I'm not sure I've ever heard a satisfactory  
explanation for WHY all these things should be enqueued anyway.   
Dependencies, sure, but why for a stylesheet or script that doesn't  
have any dependencies?

The majority of my questions center on CSS stylings so thanks a bunch for
this list. I'll subscribe to the other WP lists to see what type of traffic
they produce.

Thanks

I was mainly just addressing the general idea, not a CSS specific
example. For CSS, it might indeed be best to output it with an
attachment to wp-head.

But in general, if you want to make a separate file that will be
called separately and which you think needs to include wp-config or
similar to get access to wp functions, then this approach is the
better way to go.

The example I gave was somewhat limited. For example, I showed
SOME_IDENTIFIER=1, but that could easily be
SOME_IDENTIFIER=somestring, and you could use a switch-case construct
to make it return one of several things, depending on what somestring
is.

Obviously, this approach should only be used when you need access to
WP functions in a separate call to the site. It'll work for JS
requests as well, although admin-ajax seems simpler for that case.

> Question: ?Do enqueued CSS or scripts come specifically before or after
> wp-head output? ?Is it ***definitive*** or does it depend on the theme?

In the code:
add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles', 8);
add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_head_scripts', 9);

So, they have 8 and 9 priorities, respectively. If you add something
without changing the default priority, you get a priority of 10,
meaning the styles/scripts come first.

Duplication prevention. If you enqueue the same script (by identifier)
multiple times from multiple plugins, it will still only output the
script link once. If you tried to output it twice, then it'd cause a
page error, most likely, since it'd be trying to redefine functions.

The thing is that the request is sent to post.php and then redirected
to edit.php.

So you have to hook into 'save_post' and store the POST data in the
database to be able to retrieve it later.

Great info all around, Otto.  Thanks for this.

New Question:  Plugin A includes some JavaScript library or whatever  
and enqueues it as "xyz".  Plugin B includes the same library and also  
enqueues it as "xyz".  Okay, through the magic of code there is no  
duplication.  But what happens if Plugin A has an older version of the  
library?  If that gets loaded then Plugin B is stuck with the older  
version.  Is there a way to avoid that?  A way to ensure the newer  
version loads?

(Frankly, it would be cool if there were a way to enqueue a PHP  
library as well....)

The version parameter isn't there to avoid conflicts, it's there for
cache-busting. It's added to the script name in the output, as a get
parameter, so that if the version changes, browsers are sure to get
the new version.

The code can't cope with multiple versions in that way. It's only
looking at the handle. The one that got enqueued first would probably
be the one output.

If the library is smart enough, it will not allow itself to be loaded
twice (using function_exists or class_exists), so simple includes
would work fine with it.

If the library is not smart enough, you can wrap the include inside a
function_exists or class_exists yourself, to detect when it's already
loaded and to not load it again.

My theme recently entered it's third RC, and a common issue people are
having is a modification to the table structure for one of the tables my
theme installs. I followed the Creating Tables in Plugins guide and made
sure to use dbDelta, which as far as I know, should update the table to fit
the new structure. Can anyone tell me why this is not happening? The
modification to the table structure included replacing one column with a
different one, and of a different type.

On a side note, you shouldn't be echoing unescaped $_POST (or $_GET or
$_REQUEST) data to the page, as this can potentially cause security
issues and other problems. Have a look into the esc_attr() function.

dbDelta is VERY sensitive to the exact format of your database schema 
-- could that be the problem? Some restrictions are mentioned in 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Tables_with_Plugins but maybe not 
all. Most have to do with whitespace, such as spaces vs. tabs, and 
maybe even the type of newline character (unix, mac, windows formatted 
file).

So, you may need to look at the code of dbDelta to figure out if it is 
expecting anything else that your code is not getting exactly the way 
dbDelta wants it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] AJAX for the frontend
Message-ID: <d6c050a20909170927o18e8bf09hcdd6ec1527d5998@mail.gmail.com>

"Implementing Ajax on the viewer-facing side of a WordPress site is
slightly more ad-hoc than doing Ajax on the administration side,
because WordPress itself doesn't have viewer-facing Ajax built in"
(http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins)

'Slightly' is a gross understatement. Let's call this what it actually
is: A hack. Spent half a day hunting for an AJAX interface in the WP
front-end and discovered it doesn't exist.

It would literally only be about 50 lines or so of code to write a
wp-ajax.php file for the root WP directory that has a singular hook
that plugins could utilize for a callback. Even if the WP frontend
doesn't ever use it, plugins could cleanly and consistently leverage
the hooking interface for whatever AJAX they want on the frontend. It
would pretty much be a copy-and-paste from the admin-ajax.php script
(with maybe a couple changes to wp-settings.php), is something a core
WP developer could crank out in an evening, and would save us plugin
developers a major headache. We could then just simply use
jQuery.load('wp-ajax.php', {...}); (or similar) from wherever and,

I think there is an undocumented 'wp_ajax_nopriv' hook you may want to look
at. I've not any experience in using it yet, so I can't be more specific
than that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Child themes, and DB options
Message-ID: <7CBE63EB-A93C-418F-A20C-41AE967EF88D@g8o.net>


Hello all,

a few questions (following up on my previous one regarding extending  
themes):

If I understand it correctly, a child theme inherits template files  
from its parents (unless it has its own versions of those files). When  
such access happens, I assume include()s from the original/parent  
template of other parent PHP files will continue to work since the  
cwd() of the "includer" will be the parent template. So, if the child  
theme wants certain PHP files included in say the footer, then either  
it should copy over the footer.php and modify it, or the parent  
footer.php has to be relativised to the template (please forgive  
errors in the off the cuff PHP below):

     if( is_file(TEMPLATEPATH . "/custom-footer.php") )
         include_once(TEMPLATEPATH . "/custom-footer.php");

Is this the right approach?

By the same token, since the primary stylesheet (style.css) is located  
in the child theme, any relatives URLs in the style sheet (e.g:  
background: url(images/xyz.png) ....) will be resolved relative to the  
child theme -- so if the parent "images" directory contains icons and  
such, they will not appear in the child theme. Is that also true?

Finally, for theme options in the DB obtained using get_option(), the  
child theme will use all the options set for the parent since it (by  
default) inherits the parent's functions.php and other files (where,  
typically, options are set, read and used). Unless, once again, the  
options names are relativised to the theme name. Yes? AFAIK, there is  
no well-defined theme identifier that WP uses, and the option name  
used by the theme in get_option(), etc, can be any arbitrary string.  
Assuming that's true, the one way of relativising the option name that  
immediately comes to mind, is to use basename(TEMPLATEPATH) and use  
that as the option name. Is this a good approach?

Some background: why am I interested in all this? I want to be able to  
offer my theme users the ability to customise the theme and one neat  
way to do that (as suggested here) is to fork it into a child theme  
that they can then customise by editing pre-created and initially  
empty files in the theme editor (e.g: custom.css, footer-custom.php,  
etc). They can even add their own icons and background images and  
such, if I code up support for that.

Thank you,

	--ravi

Have a look at buddypress trunk, bp-themes/bp-sn-parent and
bp-themes/bp-default for some nice examples. The parent theme should utilize

{{{
locate_template( array( 'filename.php' ), true );
}}}
wherever you want to allow the child to override filename.php.
locate_template will search first in the child, and then in the parent.
In order to reference images in the parent directory, it is often desirable
to simply @import a stylesheet of the parent's.
Options should generally use your theme name, or some 2-3 letter version of
it, and not necessarily the basename of the path, and then your child can
easily reference the same 2-3 letter abbreviation. If you store your theme
options as a serialized array, all in one single option, this is
particularly simple.
peace~

Few points:

TEMPLATEPATH is the path to the parent theme directory. Always.

STYLESHEETPATH is the path to wherever the style.css file you're using
is. In a child theme, this would be the child theme directory. If
you're not using a child theme, then the value would be the same as
the TEMPLATEPATH.

So, a theme should use STYLESHEETPATH for all things, unless it wants
to absolutely specify itself for a file (which a child cannot
override) in which case it would use TEMPLATEPATH.

For loading a php file (which you want to allow a child theme to
override), locate_template() should be used.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Fields -- Lost by Autosave??
Message-ID: <655c405c.1ca37bc.e8ba3712.67fb@BrewerRadio.com>

I originally posted this on Wordpress.org forum, but was directed here by a moderator?
Here?s my question, I?ll be happy to forward code, login, etc, to anyone willing to help debug:
 
I'm writing a custom events plugin that integrates to the Wordpress edit post/page admin screen, and it works like a charm...
that is, until you leave the post open in the editor for "too long" (i'm guessing over 2 minutes, though I haven't verified this yet...that's the length of my autosave interval). Here's the gist:
My plugin adds an event box to the sidebar of the edit post/page screen using the following hooks/filters:
edit_post, publish_post, save_post, delete_post, admin_menu, manage_posts_columns, manage_pages_columns
When a post/page is published, if this event box is checked, then I write some stuff to the database and add 2 custom fields to the post/page: _bec_expiration (the expiration date of the event) and _bec_id (the db id of the event). (The underscores are so Wordpress doesn't display in the standard custom field section).
However, if I then leave the post up in the editor for a few minutes (?2 or longer?), then return and leave the page (without changing and/or updating my post), my custom fields, and hence my event information, is gone! -poof!-
I'm unable to find a hook into the autosave feature of Wordpress, and I'm unable to disable this functionality. (I already had to disable revisioning which interfered with my plugin also by pulling the post revision id instead of the post id). 
Any ideas?

I've updated that page to avoid threads like this in the future.

Thanks Tynan for forcing the improvement of the Codex. :)

Yeah. It was discussed a month or two ago on this list (check 
archives) -- that feature was added quite a while back, though, with 
zero announcement that I noticed. The Codex page needs to be updated, 
preferably by someone who is familiar with the (not so) new interface.

Okay, at last I had time to digg a little deeper into the code.

For a revision, the post_type is set to revision and not to post/page as I
thought earlier. So this code will work fine and sorry for the confusion. :)

Message-ID: <7d078dee.1ca37c3.e8e8b1ef.4e63@BrewerRadio.com>

I've been testing some more...
It appears that a standard custom field (i.e., NOT one appended with underscore _), does not get affected the same way.  Is there special handling of "hidden" custom fields?  Or is there something else I'm not seeing...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Fields -- Lost by Autosave??

I originally posted this on Wordpress.org forum, but was directed here by a moderator?
Here?s my question, I?ll be happy to forward code, login, etc, to anyone willing to help debug:
 
I'm writing a custom events plugin that integrates to the Wordpress edit post/page admin screen, and it works like a charm...
that is, until you leave the post open in the editor for "too long" (i'm guessing over 2 minutes, though I haven't verified this yet...that's the length of my autosave interval). Here's the gist:
My plugin adds an event box to the sidebar of the edit post/page screen using the following hooks/filters:
edit_post, publish_post, save_post, delete_post, admin_menu, manage_posts_columns, manage_pages_columns
When a post/page is published, if this event box is checked, then I write some stuff to the database and add 2 custom fields to the post/page: _bec_expiration (the expiration date of the event) and _bec_id (the db id of the event). (The underscores are so Wordpress doesn't display in the standard custom field section).
However, if I then leave the post up in the editor for a few minutes (?2 or longer?), then return and leave the page (without changing and/or updating my post), my custom fields, and hence my event information, is gone! -poof!-
I'm unable to find a hook into the autosave feature of Wordpress, and I'm unable to disable this functionality. (I already had to disable revisioning which interfered with my plugin also by pulling the post revision id instead of the post id). 
Any ideas?

Sharon,

When saving the custom field data inside the function that gets called
with the save_post (or edit_post, can't remember off the top of my
head) hook, you need to check that the post being saved isn't a
revision or an autosave.

Eg I use the following code:

if ( wp_is_post_revision( $post_ID ) or wp_is_post_autosave( $post_ID ) )
	return;

HTH, John.

Ah! I got misled by this bit in the Codex:

=======

<?php get_sidebar('right'); ?>
Causes the template TEMPLATEPATH . 'sidebar-right.php' to be  
included. ...

=======

 From the above, I assumed that TEMPLATEPATH would point to the child  
theme directory (so that template PHP files -- e.g: sidebar-right.php  
-- get picked up from the child).

Thank you for the correction Otto, and the advice Otto and Tynan.

Thanks, John.
I'm not sure I follow though...

It's not that I'm saving data for an autosave version, it's that my custom field is simply removed from the post.  Darndest thing, really.

Good call for the revision check, though.  I'll see if I can't re-enabled that feature.

Want me to setup an account for you to see what I'm talking about?

More testing...
It is, in fact, the autosave.  If I pull up a post (with custom fields already saved to it) in the editor, leave it up mere seconds, the custom fields remain unchanged.  

However, if I allow the autosave to fire -- leaving the msg "Draft Saved at [...] Last edited by [...]" and then I close the UNCHANGED/UN-UPDATED post, and return to it again, custom fields are missing (my event data is not recognized and quick check of postmeta table comes up empty).

I suppose I could workaround by not "hiding" my custom fields, but then I run the risk of users tinkering with the data.  Hmmm...sure wish I could figure out what's happening.

What I meant was that your save_post hook is firing on every save. The
save_post hook is fired when an autosave occurs, *but* an autosave
won't contain the hidden field data that your hook expects, therefore
you should put the code above into your hook so that nothing occurs
when an autosave is saved.

There was similar ticket recently:

OK, with you now.  However, still experiencing same behavior after adding:

add_action('edit_post',     array($_bec, 'PostEventsMeta'));
add_action('save_post',     array($_bec, 'PostEventsMeta'));
function PostEventsMeta($id) {
	if ( wp_is_post_revision( $id ) || wp_is_post_autosave( $id ) )
		return;
	...
}

The autosave removes the custom fields I've added before, even though the autosave version *should* be saved as a revision, no?  

Looks to me like the autosave should contain the meta data for the post, but in that case, my plugin would not break.  Perhaps I don't understand autosave feature well enough...

Many thanks,
Sharon

What I meant was that your save_post hook is firing on every save. The
save_post hook is fired when an autosave occurs, *but* an autosave
won't contain the hidden field data that your hook expects, therefore
you should put the code above into your hook so that nothing occurs
when an autosave is saved.

Try removing the edit_post hook. You should only need the save_post hook.

The link provided by Andrew did the trick...

I did a search before posting, but new to the hackers list; sorry for duplicate post.

Many thanks!

>>> When a post/page is published, if this event box is checked, then I write some stuff to the database and add 2 custom fields to the post/page: _bec_expiration (the expiration date of the event) and _bec_id (the db id of the event). (The underscores are so Wordpress doesn't display in the standard custom field section).
>>> However, if I then leave the post up in the editor for a few minutes (?2 or longer?), then return and leave the page (without changing and/or updating my post), my custom fields, and hence my event information, is gone! -poof!-
>>> I'm unable to find a hook into the autosave feature of Wordpress, and I'm unable to disable this functionality. (I already had to disable revisioning which interfered with my plugin also by pulling the post revision id instead of the post id).

Just FYI for those that care. I just added a patch to trac that adds an
activate_theme action to core. This action runs after a new theme has
been activated.

Perhaps you could also correct the Codex page, so that other users won't be
mislead.

I moseyed on over to the Codex page to update it, but then I  
discovered at the bottom of the page, this apt NOTE in the "Including  
Any Template" section:

========

* TEMPLATEPATH is a reference to the absolute path to the current  
template directory (without the / at the end). For information on  
referencing URIs rather than including files, see Referencing Files  
 From a Template.

* STYLESHEETPATH should be used to include a file located within a  
child theme.

========

So, perhaps this Note should be generalised a bit and moved to its own  
section, so it applies to all mentions of TEMPLATEPATH? Apologies of  
Codex discussions should be done elsewhere... the Discussion page,  
duh! ;-)

Also, perhaps the user should be pointed to locate_template() rather  
than STYLESHEETPATH.

Subject: [wp-hackers] FOrce login on WP
Message-ID: <lq89b5ll7a2uvnl92u86r34l0cuev22634@4ax.com>

I try again... I need to force WP login without have users passing
through the login screen neither have to reload a page (i could
simulate the login form and the url redirection but this will reload
the page)

I need to do this letting all the filters after login screen to works
like usual, i tried to use wp_authenticate_username_password passing
an array with the data as readed in the code file but no luck i do not
get the correct cookies. I tried this after the header of the them is
sent, cause in the header i have "something" that give me the username
e password, i suppose i call wp_authenticate_username_password too
late, maybe i have to call it during an early stage, but i can't
figure aout what it is. COnsider i have to run Zend to have singleton
function that give me the current username e password (a login in
another site)

I'm getting mad and I know that the solution is just in front of me
even if I do not see it.

Thank all!

Try to use AJAX for auth to no-reload page and push data through some
form and after auth you simply remove form from screen.
Don't forget on hidden form fields at wp-admin login page.

Message-ID: <ae81acd10909190906p122d4aa2qe67ae93291cb188@mail.gmail.com>

Peeps,

I have code with:

add_action('future_to_publish', 'do_stuff');
function do_stuff( $post ) {
  var_dump( $post ); die();
}

Then I schedule a post, refresh the blog home page like mad till the
scheduled post is supposed to show, and instead of the expected ugly
var_dump() & die(), the scheduled blog post just appears as a new post
and function do_stuff() has been bypassed.

What am I not getting with future posts ? :)
(or: how can I catch it when a post goes from 'future' to 'publish')

Pretty sure scheduled posts are published with cron, so you'll never
see the var dump yourself as it's always called asynchronously.
Instead of var_dump()ing you could mail() the results to yourself.

WP triggers the cron by making a separate request to itself, so you
won't see the response (see spawn_cron() in wp-includes/cron.php).

Write to a file?

Nice idea but the login shoul be done without anything change during
page load, users shoulnd' be aware there is a double login system, all
have to be done in the easiest and simple way without letting people
know of it.

Anilo's suggestion is the only way it can be done. If you don't want
anything on the screen changing then it's got to be AJAX. Any other
method will cause a page reload. There needs to be some sort of UI
feedback when people log in otherwise how will they know they've just
logged in?

not much more caught...

add_action('future_to_publish', 'do_stuff');
add_action('publish_post', 'do_stuff');
function do_stuff( $in ) {
  $f = fopen( dirname(__FILE__).'/log.log', 'a' );
  fwrite( $f, print_r($in, true) );
  fclose( $f );
  return $in;
}

File log.log is created normally if I publish a post, but nothing
happens if I schedule one.

Pulling my hair.

Make sure that wp_publish_future_post() actually triggers that action.

Real login in another part of the site (a non WP part already there
with hudndreds thousands ysers) in the header of the theme there is
code that get the header of the whole site included into WP theme and
thre there is the user status, the login link if not already logged
etc. So i just need to have them get logged to WP it already logged on
main site. Nothing about the login and logout is done by users in WP
all have to happens behind the scene. When user log out the wp cookies
will be deleted.

I'm a bit confused -- People have suggested AJAX and you refuse that  
suggestion.  Why?

AFAIKS it's not possible without AJAX to avoid reloading the screen.   
As you specifically don't want to reload the screen, that pretty much  
means AJAX.

Just tested this on my local install (2.9-rare) with the following code:

<?php
add_action('future_to_publish', 'do_stuff', 10, 1);
function do_stuff( $in ) {
  $f = fopen( dirname(__FILE__).'/log.log', 'a' );
  fwrite( $f, "\nBefore\n" );
  fwrite( $f, print_r($in, true) );
  fwrite( $f, "\nAfter\n" );
  fclose( $f );
  return $in;
}
?>

Scheduled a post for a couple of mins in the future and refreshed the  
page to get cron to run.

And got this in log.log:
---------------

I think the key here is to notice that add_action/do_action by default does not
pass any arguments to your callback.  So to get it to pass any ammount
of arguments you need to specify that in your add_action, hence the
specification of '1' in Peter's example for add_action.

Oh dear god.
Turns out the problem was I'm dumb. Everything was enclosed in a
is_admin() clause, hence obviously not being triggered by refreshing
the public part.

Thanks for suggestions all, I'm off to commit seppuku

Hi Matt,
The default for add_action() / add_filter() is that it will pass 1 argument
to your function unless otherwise specified. So if you just do:

add_action('action_name', 'do_stuff');

Then do_stuff() will have be sent a single argument.

If the filter/action requires more than 1 argument, then you must manually
specify it like you've done:

add_action('action_name', 'do_stuff', 10, 3);

Subject: [wp-hackers] query_posts tag parameters
Message-ID: <bf55ecdd0909201830y1811eb5exa0eb0b94c730a2bb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I am trying to do a basic tag query using the following tag parameters

query_posts(array('tag__in' => array('Marriage') ) );
query_posts(array('tag__and' => array('Marriage') ) );
query_posts(array('tag__not_in' => array('Marriage') ) );

But they don't appear to be working - this is the first time I've tried to
use them so wanted to check:
a) If i doing it properly; and if so
b) If this is a known problem or if it is just me?

query_posts('tag=xxx'); appears to be working so I am stumped.

Using MU latest version.

Thanks in advance.
Jason

I think you may have to use either the tag slug (so 'mariage' instead
of 'Marriage') or the tag ID (eg. 3). Haven't got an install handy to
double check though.

Thanks = Yeah only appears to like the tag ID's.

I assumed from the Codex it is supposed to work with slugs/tag names as
well.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Querying posts inside hierarchical custom taxonomy
Message-ID: <59e7f3130909210135q50c7a16cu96dcfcdf9755e288@mail.gmail.com>

Custom taxonomy for posts is "places".
Hierarchy is like
Europe
  France
  Germany
Asia
  Vietnam

I can query posts from "France" or "Vietnam".
How should I query posts to get all those from Europe or Asia ?
There is no children term query inside wp_query (query.php, around
line 1947, there is : $terms = get_terms($q['taxonomy'],
array('slug'=>$q['term'])); , with no way to ask for children terms).

Message-ID: <59e7f3130909210135n2d103896y682a0fef97af47a3@mail.gmail.com>

I have created a new hierarchical CTaxo, 'places' (regions and
departements, in France, like Bretagne > C?tes d'Armor, or Ile de
France > Paris).
The page wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=places works ok (it doesn't
appear automatically though, despite 2.8 promises ?) but works like a
post_tag edit page : children and parents do not appear as such, but
as a flat taxonomy.

Q : Is there a way to manage _hierarchical_ custom taxonomies without
recreating the whole wp-admin/categories.php ?

Yes, I have tried wp-admin/categories.php?taxonomy=places, without succes.

to do anything.. I think i'll post my work onto trac at some point in the  
near future and see if anyone else can take it on..

You should have the parameter to class_exists() in quotations, otherwise 
you'll get warnings.

To be clear:

Do you want to query_posts(...) or do you want to get_terms(...) ?

This ticket has a big patch that handles showing meta boxes for
hierarchical taxonomies on the post edit page.  I don't recall any
patches that add custom taxonomy support to categories.php, however.

I'm also unclear about what you're asking.

Assuming you want to get all posts in a given term AND its children,
have you checked that it doesn't already do so when you fetch the
term? For categories it already does so, though maybe not for
hierarchical custom taxonomies. The categories part in in
wp-includes/query.php :

1789    $q['category__in'] = array_merge($q['category__in'],
get_term_children($cat, 'category'));

Maybe that's helpful,

Message-ID: <a00d002b0909211846x44b2fd66vc5145a6f189e82cf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to use DOMDocument to parse content in a plugin filter, and the
line:

$wpa_doc = new DOMDocument();

is totally disrupting WP.  Putting this one line in a plugin file all by
itself makes WP return a blank page, and putting it in a filter makes output
cut off right before the content.

Any ideas as to why this happens or how to use DOMDocument and avoid this
result?

Thanks very much for your help.

Todd

The XML extensions were introduced to PHP in version 5, so could the
site in question still be running PHP 4?

Oops... left that part out!

The same line, and all DOMDocument functionality, are working outside of 
WP.  Also tried on multiple WP installs (2.8.4 and 2.5) with the same 
result.

No entries in the server error log.

Thanks!

You cannot possibly hope to fix this without finding out what the actual
error is. Do calls to error_log() show up in the error log? If you make
a syntax error, do they show up? Is PHP running out of memory (try
increasing your memory_limit in php.ini)?

isn't exactly the case.  Can't have my plugin causing these kinds of 
problems, so I'll have to do something else.

Apologies for the mistake, and thanks for your help!

If your plugin is intended for public consumption, then unfortunately
depending on classes that are not likely to be installed is not really
possible if users on shared hosts is part of your target audience.

Such is life. :(

If you can manage to parse the content without an XML parser, you could
still include the DOMDocument code for use if the user does happen to
have it installed, for better security/more speed/whatever.

Checking class_exists('DOMDocument') could help you there. :)

For categories, wp_query does return posts in Category and Children categories.
For hierarchical taxonomies, wp_query returns only posts in Taxonomy,
no posts from Children taxonomies, and I haven't find a workaround
yet.

Subject: [wp-hackers] add_action arrays?
Message-ID: <77b239a00909230500l65754c30v4cd1e4cfd3b10f5b@mail.gmail.com>

I've seen a few plugins and bits of code internal to WordPress use the
following convention:

add_action('pre_get_posts', array(&$this, 'postFilter'));

But this usage is not documented anywhere? I attempted to use the same
convention and got the following error:

call_user_func_array() [function.call-user-func-array]: First argument
is expected to be a valid callback, 'Array' was given in blah, blah,
blah...

I was looking at the code for add_action and add_filter, and they
definitely seem to not take arrays into account as far as I can tell.
Is this a deprecated way of doing things? Is there some other way to
hook an object method into an action or filter?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <4ABA107E.9060506@gaarai.com>

Passing array( &$this, 'method_name' ) as the callback argument is a way 
of passing a class method as the callback rather than just a flat function.

Using the $this variable would require a class instance, for example:

if ( ! class_exists( 'PluginTest' ) ) {
    class PluginTest {
        function PluginTest() {
            add_action( 'admin_menu', array( &$this, 'create_menu' ) );
        }
       
        function create_menu() {
            ...
        }
    }
   
    new PluginTest();
}

I hope this helps answer your question.

It's for when you use a class method as the callback. The first item
in the array is a reference to the class, the second to the method.

Important note: It's for when you use a class method as the callback,
*from inside the class itself*.

This is because $this references the object that you're currently in.

class PluginClass {
   function PluginClass() {
      add_action( 'some_action_hook', array( &$this, 'some_function' ) );
   }
   function some_function() {
      // whatever
   }
}
$plugin_object = new PluginClass();


That will work fine. But if you tried something like this:

class PluginClass {
   function some_function() {
      // whatever
   }
}
$plugin_object = new PluginClass();
add_action( 'some_action_hook', array( &$this, 'some_function' ) );

Then you'll have a problem, because $this makes no sense in that context.

You could do this instead:
add_action( 'some_action_hook', array( &$plugin_object, 'some_function' ) );

But that's bad practice. Better to let the class itself do its own
setup on instantiation.

Thomas,

You are not alone and others have pointed out the obvious omission of documentation about the aforementioned array callback format in WordPress inline documentation. This is, as I have pointed out before, because PHP itselfs has documentation on this and a check for callable "type"[1] should have lead you to many great resources on this information. Meh, I believe a little attempt at explaining this is also in WordPress, but where I'm unsure, and I could be mistaken.

As others have provided said information in this thread, I would assume this matter to be closed. However, since this is the second time that I'm aware of someone having a problem with lack of PHP information, I think providing a link to the callable "type"[1] documentation should be provided in WordPress to provide an opportunity for fellow WordPress developers, as well as plugin and theme developers to learn.

I was also unaware that this was a general PHP help forum. Well, to be fair, if said question was posted on PHP help forums, the response might have been, "RTFM" or "Ask WordPress" along with some disparaging remark about your mother or your lack of certain skills, but with a 'z' instead of a 's' and I will assume in some ironic attempt to be clever[2].

I'm not exactly sure how one would fit in pointers to the callable type, I believe it is somewhere already in the plugin API inline documentation, but there is a lot of wording, much of which is relevant to WordPress specifically. I believe it might have been put in arbitrary at one point once it was realized that one might not have any idea what the callable type actually was and couldn't be concerned to search on Google or PHP.net, but then it was realized that you must be this tall to ride and those that aren't are probably going suffer from other, more pressing problems. 

Jacob Santos

[1] While PHP suggests that it isn't an actual native type, not like it is in JavaScript, it still has some "magic" to it like a language type. Well, we're not speaking of PHP5.3 which makes it closer to one, but still not native.

[2] We've all done this, right, at some point? Good times.

Jacob,

Wow. Ok, thanks for that?

I see you've updated the docs, thanks. I was unfamiliar with the "callable"
type until this point; I'm glad people on this list can help when we need
it, even if it does seem occasionally redundant to provide such
explanations.

Thanks to everyone who responded.

Not sure if this feature has been discussed, but I think WP could  
benefit in having installation profiles, similar to that of drupal.  
Has anyone previously proposed this?

Installation profiles could automatically pre configure WordPress with  
a set of activated plugins, change the default activated theme and  
could also possibly change/add some default settings/content?--all  
during the install process. This could be beneficial to a lot of users/ 
developers allowing them to jump right into content creation instead  
of site configuration.

Users could create a profile that contains all their settings and  
activated plugins they'd usually have to configure after installing  
WP. The profile that they create could also be used across all their  
blogs--saving a lot of time.

As for implementation, that's up for debate. Changes would have to be  
made to the core installation process. Ideally, installation profiles  
should make the famous 5 min install even quicker.

Anyone +1?

Sounds like a great idea, but i don't really think they'll accept it

Subject: [wp-hackers] Insert stuff into the excerpt based on a custom field,
	wipe out custom field
Message-ID: <5DA317E2-E484-4FF1-9671-2B0A4C9E03CF@emrl.com>

Hello all,

This is the first time I've posted on this mailing list, hope this  
request isn't repetitive/annoying/whatever.

I'm trying to create a system that will parse YouTube URLs into a  
linked thumbnail with Shadowbox/lightbox/your favorite box integrated.  
To do that, I need a function that will check for a custom field,  
parse the URL, spit it back out formatted, then insert the formatted  
URL into post_excerpt and wipe out the custom field.

Here's what I have so far in my functions.php file of my theme:

function example($post_ID)

{
$yt = get_post_meta($post_ID, 'yt', TRUE);
if ($yt!="") {
	$qs = parse_url($yt);
	parse_str($qs[query]);
	$lnk = '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/'.$v.'"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/'.$v.'/0.jpg 
" alt="" /></a>';
	$n_post = array();
	$n_post['ID'] = $post_ID;
	$n_post['post_excerpt'] = 'wut';
	wp_update_post( $n_post );
	delete_post_meta($ins_id, 'yt');
	}
}

add_action('save_post' , 'example');

I'm using save_post because according to the Codex, it runs right  
after a post is saved.

Now, this works, but it causes the request for post.php to timeout and  
I end up with a blank white screen. If I go look at my post, it's  
there, properly formatted, but I don't want freeze up saving posts for  
this. Is there a better way to do it?

-Matthew

That's an interesting idea Ptah. I'm thinking I might be able to make a
plugin that exports everything into a single archive file. The unzipped
archive could be loaded somewhere, a specific PHP file could be run, and
it would take care of the rest.

Does that sound promising?

I could be wrong but didn't Matt M create installer profile functionality at
the CMS Showdown at SXSW last year? 

If so is that code around to work off of?

You should probably use wp_parse_str(), but other than that, it looks good.
It shouldn't timeout.

The problem is that you are hooking save_post and performing a
wp_update_post within the callback.  wp_update_post causes the save_post
action to be fired again and thus you are creating a processing loop.

A better solution therefore would be to use the wp_insert_post_data  
filter and modify the data being inserted/updated before it hits the db.

using a filter probably content_save_pre and filtering the content
before it is saved to the DB would be a better choice.

In case anyone's interested, here was my solution. It's kind of a neat  
thing, I think:

function scc_yt($content)
{
$yt = get_post_meta($_POST['ID'], 'yt', TRUE);
if ($yt!="") {
	$qs = parse_url($yt);
	parse_str($qs[query]);
	$lnk = '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/'.$v.'"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/'.$v.'/0.jpg 
" alt="" /></a>';
	$content = $lnk;
	delete_post_meta($_POST['ID'], 'yt');
	return $content;
	}
}

add_filter('excerpt_save_pre','scc_yt');

In conjunction with Shadowbox JS, this turns a raw YouTube link into  
clickable thumbnails that open the video in an overlay.

Working great now, thanks!

Most default scripts are included in the footer, when possible. It's usually
a plugin that forces jQuery, for example, to be loaded in the head.

{{{
global $wp_scripts;

wp_enqueue_script(
    'comment-reply',
    $wp_scripts->registered['comment-reply']->src,
    $wp_scripts->registered['comment-reply']->deps,
    $wp_scripts->registered['comment-reply']->ver,

it would be nice if there was a simpler approach tho. maybe this merits a
trac ticket.

peace~

For default scripts, if you want to force them to the footer when
they're not already:

global $wp_scripts;
$wp_scripts->add_data('comment-reply', 'group', 1 );

Then just enqueue as per normal:

wp_enqueue_script('comment-reply');

The WP Quick Installer that DD32's been working on here:
http://wpquickinstall.com

Has this sort of capability. Currently it only supports the default
two plugins, but it is shaping up to be a good platform for this sort
of thing.

I used the nightly trunk version here:
http://wpquickinstall.com/download/nightly-trunk/

To install on a site and it worked pretty well. Some minor issues, but
no real problems for the most part.

Thank you for your answers. Tynan's approach still places it in header while
Otto's make error (Call to a member function add_data() on a non-object in
...).

Maybe I didn't describe what I want. I wanted to enqueue script in footer in
frontend, not in admin.

My understanding of in_footer thing was that it will load script in footer
if there is no plugin/theme that call it in head, so if other plugin use
standard way of enqueuning (without defining in_footer), script will be
loaded in head, no matter if there are plugins which place it in footer.

But anyway, I can't place script in footer even when only that one plugin is
activated, meaning that no other plugin is enqueuning that same script.

Glad to hear it mostly worked Otto. Getting a new site up in the next few  
days, once thats done, I'll be pushing the development along more.
I'm going to leave "packaged" plugins alone for now, I'm just going to get  
it up and running with a choice of 2 installs:
"Latest Stable version"
"Latest Stable version (Development)" (That'll enable WP_DEBUG and  
possibly in the future add extra plugins)
"Latest Nightly version (Development)"

But once its running well, I'd like something like the Linux package  
installers, ie. Select a "Role" and it preselects a few plugins from a  
list (Or, it could be a customised Role, so you select the plugins you  
want)

You're doing it too soon. The wp-scripts variable needs to be defined
before you call my code example. So, put it on the init action hook or
similar.

There are actions to specifically enqueue scripts and stylesheets:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/script-loader.php#L684
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/admin-header.php#L54

If you really need to change the location of a default script by hand 
you could use:

$wp_scripts->add_data('handle', 'group', 1 );

as Otto suggested, where 1 = footer, 0 = head. This has to run after the 
scripts are added/registered but before any scripts are printed, best 
done from the above actions with priority of 11 or more.

However note that scripts are moved from the footer to the head if a 
dependent script is enqueued there, forcing the default script back to 
the footer would break the dependency.

Best way is to register a new Query Var, And add a rewrite rule which  
links to it.

eg, Your urls would be:
/xyz/ and ?xyz=1

You check on template_redirect that
if ( 1 == get_query_var('xyz') ) {
    //do stuff,
    die();
}

May seem a bit.. quick and nasty reply, but it'll do.
See this example plugin:
http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/test-rewrite.php
(Replace all uses of isset($wp_query->query_vars.....) with  
get_query_var() for best coding practices)

Message-ID: <427667db0909290010g5a71273dw5c9fbf470c61a107@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Does anyone know of a definitive list of all the constants in
WordPress, and in particular, which constants are able to be
user-defined?
ie. which constants allow for if (!defined('_CONSTANT')) define(
'_CONSTANT', 1 );

I'm working on a change which requires additions to wp-config.php and
don't currently have access to a computer for grepping the list of
constants to figure this out for myself. Hopefully someone has already
done this.

Thanks.

This answers the first question:

The second one should be easily solved by some clicking and reading code

And you should probably read mailing list descriptions more carefully.  
I don't think this is the right list for you.

Something I've never wondered before: any reason $table_prefix is a
var while all other stuff are consts? Or is it just legacy?

It's possible you might want to create a new instance of wpdb at some
point and connect it to another set of tables (in the same database).

Constants can't be redefined during runtime. Globals can.

Ooh!  Could it be possible I'm going about something the wrong way? :P

I have multiple WP installations on the same server/same db...different domains...sharing some event data.  I have done things the hard way between the two, haven't I?  Instead of creating a new wpdb instance, I directly modified the post/postmeta tables to propagate this data from one installation to the other.  (Even though I was mildly aware that this wasn't good form, I opted for quick and dirty--never a good idea.)

Anything I would need to keep in mind if creating another instance of wpdb?  I already have my code setup as a plugin on one server, with an admin option screen to give the name of the other install's prefix...

Thanks, Otto (and Ozh for the inquiry)!

It's really easy.

$mydb = new wpdb( [user], [password], [db name], [db host] );

and then just use $mydb where you would normally use $wpdb.

Sorry, meant to add that I've been using this on a statistics database
for a good few months now and no issues at all have come up. Works
just like $wpdb.

Man, where were you guys two weeks ago? :)

I should've known...ever since I started working with Wordpress almost 3 years ago, I continue to be impressed how well written and easy to work with it is...You guys keep up the good work!  I'll keep hacking at it until I realize that wheel's already been invented...

Message-ID: <902424490909291339m11b4a17bte321b2492a30cf45@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any particular reason we don't have many options in the Bulk
Actions SELECT box on the Edit Posts (or Pages) screens, or has it
just not really come up yet?

I was just editing a blog, disabling commenting on a bunch of posts,
and realized that I couldn't do that through the Bulk Actions menu,
but it seemed to make sense that I should be able to.

Here's a patch to allow that: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10878

Depending on how far we wanted to go with this, we might also want to
have options for doing the same with Pingbacks?

May i know why most of you top-post?

I thought that is not a correct etiquette for a *mailing-list* , since
the mails are going to be archived. 

Why to contribute to global warming by wasting unnecessary bandwidth by
doing top-posting??

The reason I top post is that I use Gmail. It encourages it and the
conversations feature makes top/bottom posting irrelevant.

I don't think it matters. I do know it's improper etiquette to start a  
new thread by replying to an old one... am guilty of that myself.

But what about the people like me using simpler mail clients? And i also
strongly state that top-posting people are contributing to the global
warming crisis and unnecessarily hog extra bandwidth :(

The aggregate increase of blood pressure caused by these threads is
demonstrably larger.

Gmail's MUTE feature is great.

You're probably right in that it just hasn't come up. I'd also say
that bulk enabling/disabling comments is a much less common action
than bulk editing posts (but probably just as uncommon as bulk
deleting which is another option in the dropdown).

I'd prefer not to see a too many actions added to the bulk action
dropdown as it adds noise when you're looking for the 'delete' or
'edit' option.

I think the logic in you reasoning is off in regards to added bandwidth.  Bottom posting does not infer that are clipping or snpping only the text that is relevant to your reply.  It simply means starting your reply below the quoted text instead of above.

Consider a thread with some 50 replies. If everyone top-posts in that
thread, at the end of 50 th reply the OP's message will be repeated for
50 times, 49 times the second persons reply and so on.!!?? Is this
tolerable size? Thus the top-posting wastes the bandwidth. :( I find it
quite annoying. 

Bottom-posting is also not preferred. Interleaved posting is my
choice :)

It used to be taboo to reply at the top of a message ("top posting") 
until Microsoft made it the default setting.

A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting.
Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?

I've never had a reason to even think about doing this. Same goes for
top posting. Gmail's conversations feature is the culprit here. In the
future I'll definitely bear it in mind (think of the children, etc).

Not everybody uses Gmail. It's a common courtesy to bottom-post and 
trim, and to interleave when treating a subject point-by-point.

Actually care of a comment on the ticket (from azaozz), I realized

If one's not competent enough to read an email thread (filled with
separators like headers, indents, and such) from bottom to top, then this
whole discussion is probably beyond comprehension.

In addition, top posting prevents people from having to scroll to the bottom
to read the response.

Finally, given that top posting is clearly in the majority, it is bottom
posters who are messing things up.  :)

But certainly there are more important issues to get one's knickers in a
twist about than the order of email replies.

I believe creationists are in the majority as well. Let us revise

Thanks to all who replied.
The state of the Codex for developer information doesn't encourage
anyone to rely on the information on it, and is missing a lot of
detail.
Does anyone know what happened to the documentation project?

Sure. I'm a bit tired right now, so I'll have to look into it tomorrow.

You seem to have misunderstood the term wp-"hackers". If you are looking 
for someone to attack and compromise that facebook application you've 
come to the wrong place. We discuss coding on a blogging software called 
Wordpress in this list.

Kind regards,
Raj

Because clearly saving you a few seconds time is *way* more important
than improving readability and your mail looking more neat and tidy for
both people reading the list and people reading the archives.

Even on Gmail, I bottom-post. It takes, what, 5 seconds extra effort?
*delete* *delete* *drag* *enter* *start typing*

Get with it, guys.

And the arguments that top-posting is easier because you don't have to
scroll down are frankly ridiculous. With bottom-posting comes trimming.
If you don't trim, then yes, you are just as bad as the top-posters.

Learn to bottom-post, or don't participate.

(There are so many pro?top-posting posts I thought I would throw my two
cents in there; a furnace it may be. And yes, don't even think about
it. :-P)

I love threads like this. People end up saying stupid things like this:

If I said "Learn to read top-posts or don't participate" I don't think
you'd be too pleased. So let's remember the perspective here. It's not
that big a deal.
