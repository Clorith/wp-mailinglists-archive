If I wanted to modify the comment form, I'd do it in one of two ways.
Both of them require that the theme is at least semi-standard.

Method 1:
Both the default and classic themes have this code in them, after the
comment form:
do_action('comment_form', $post->ID);
You could use that to insert new fields, but they're going to show up
below the comment box itself. Maybe not preferable, but it will work
in a pinch. It'd be fine for hidden fields.

Method 2:
Both the default and classic themes display the comments template by
calling the comments_template() function. This function actually gets
the comments and then requires the comments.php file from the theme.
However, it passes that file through this filter first:
$include = apply_filters('comments_template', TEMPLATEPATH . $file );
You could write a filter there to intercept that file and replace it
with the name of your own file. By putting the original filename in a
global somewhere, your file could read that file, modify the contents
of it as you see fit, and then output it. Sort of a roundabout way of
modifying the comments.php, but it would work well.

Both methods rely on the theme in question doing the right thing. All
themes should include the comment_form action hook (because that is
what allows the wp_comment_form_unfiltered_html_nonce to work, which
allows authorized users to include html code in comments). And all
theme should be using the comments_template() call to include comments
(as opposed to retrieving comments from the DB themselves).

Advisory by Jose Carlos Norte

Wordpress is vulnerable to XSS attacks when custom 404 pages are used by the
template.

The problem (sidebar.php):

<form method="get" id="searchform" action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];
?>">

if wordpress template use custom 404 pages, like:


<?php get_header(); ?>

        <div id="content" class="narrowcolumn">

                <h2 class="center">Error 404 - Not Found</h2>

        </div>

<?php get_sidebar(); ?>

$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; can contain special characters to break out html and
perform XSS attacks, example:

http://www.example.com/index.php/"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

if no custom 404 page set by wordpress theme this attacks is not posible.

Hi all, I use a custom search form but I replaced that $_SERVER call 
with "root folder":

<form method="post" id="searchform" action="/">


Actually I don't understand why theme developer use the PHP_SELF. Maybe 
for compatibility reasons? (due to .htaccess?)

The main reason against using / for it is that WP can be installed in a  
subfolder.
maybe it should be changed to <?php echo get_option('home'); ?> then?

Just looking at my theme i'm using, its set to <?php bloginfo('home'); ?>
(as the search is in the header, not WP's sidebar)

Yes, this should probably be changed. Please create a Trac ticket if you
could, and assign it to me (rob1n). I'll put it through.

This has been fixed in the bundled themes for awhile.

Something should probably be added to the Documentation on Creating Themes,
then.

WordPress' default theme is not vulnerable:

> <form method="get" id="searchform" action="<?php bloginfo('url'); ?>/">

Neither is classic:

> <form id="searchform" method="get" action="<?php bloginfo('home'); ?>">

Oh, by the way, which is better to get the URL from? home or url?

We deprecated "home" a while back, and now it's "url" for the homepage and
"wpurl" for the WP installation.

This plugin creates your personal YouTube plugin for wordpress.
wordTube supports the streaming video format (Format .flv or .swf), 
sound files as MP3 and JPG, GIF or PNG grafic files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

...
----------------------------------------------------------------


Input passed to the "wpPATH" parameter in wordtube-button.php is not
properly verified before being used to include files. 
This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local or external
resources.
Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

Vulnerability:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Invalid include function at js/wptable-button.php :

global $wpdb;
...
----------------------------------------------------------------


Input passed to the "wpPATH" parameter in js/wptable-button.php is not
properly verified before being used to include files. 
This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local or external
resources.
Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

These kinds of deprecations really need to be announced somewhere. I'm
fairly certain maybe 3 people knew about this. Not much of a
deprecation if you ask me.

I am not sure, since the default/classic themes are currently safe, 
what needs to be mentioned or where it should be put.  But if you can 
(a) write up something rough or a summary of what you think needs to 
be mentioned, perhaps with a code line or two, and (b) suggest which 
article it should be added to (list of theme-related articles is at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Templates ), I would be glad to (c) 
edit/expand it if necessary and add it to the Codex.

There are no plans whatsoever for removing these, since so many plugins and
themes (an even some obscure parts of the core code) use these "deprecated"
values. Perhaps deprecated isn't the best word -- let's say "url" and
"wpurl" are "preferred" over the other values.

Although I think the default sidebar code still does contain several 
references to bloginfo('home')...along the lines of

<p>You are currently browsing the <a href="<?php bloginfo('home');

what about a codex page to track that "preferences" anyway? just an  
easy table like:

- actual/legacy function
- preferred function
- wp version which implements first the preferred one

What is currently done (or what is supposed to be done) in the Codex 
along these lines:

* The bloginfo function doc page lists the currently preferred inputs 
(non-preferred are not mentioned). If someone wanted to add a section 
there listing the older inputs and current replacements, it might be 
useful. Feel free; if you are not a Codex expert but want to help, 
make up a list and I can add it to the doc page.

* Generally, on the function documentation list pages (Template Tags, 
Function Reference, etc.), functions are marked with which WP version 
they were created in, and which WP version they were deprecated in. 
This may not be perfect (the Codex is maintained by volunteers after 
all), but that is at least the plan.

* If you visit the individual doc page for a function that has been 
deprecated, it should say what the replacement function is and what WP 
version it was deprecated in.

* There are also version-to-version upgrade guides in the Codex for 
plugin/theme authors that list deprecated functions and suggest 
authors update to use new functions.

If you think the Codex needs additional documentation pages related to 
of preferred/deprecated behavior, probably the right place to discuss 
it is on the Doc list. Personally, I think what is listed above is 
probably sufficient for most purposes.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Parameterized Wordpress themes
Message-ID: <463A2EC5.5000105@metalab.unc.edu>

How are theme developers handling paramterized themes? For instance. I'd 
like to allow theme users to set any or all of the following:

1. URL of sidebar image
2. Amazon associates ID
3. Background color
4. Whether or not to show the blogroll
etc.

I'd like to be able to write a theme that has a nice forms UI for 
supplying data like this; ideally one integrated with the WordPress 
admin panel.

The customization options should be stored outside the theme directory 
so upgrading a theme doesn't nuke preexisting options.

Is this possible short of writing a plugin juts for the use of the theme?

If you want to integrate to the admin panel, I think you need to write 
it as a plugin. The admin panel section of WP does not automatically 
load themes to see if they want to define new admin panels. It does 
load plugins.

Huh? Sure it does. The functions.php file in the active theme is
automatically included, just like a plugin, and it can create new
admin panels and anything else it wants to do.

The default theme does this, in fact. Activate it and then look at the
new menu under Presentation that lets you Customize the Header color
and such.


Anyway, that's how you do it. Use functions.php to add your admin
page. Use it to write a form, and when the form is posted, save your
options to the database. Then use them in the rest of the theme.

As Otto suggests, my novice experience with this is that this is all
standard practice.

On one of my blogs I use Glued Ideas Themes, and now that blog's
options table includes serialized data gi_subtle_theme.

You can use the theme's functions.php, and add submenu pages to the admin
panel much as you'd do from a plugin. See K2 for an example.

As for keeping preferences between upgrades, why not just use wp_options?

I posted briefly on how I'm approaching it here:
http://literalbarrage.org/blog/archives/2007/05/03/a-theme-tip-for-wordpress-theme-authors/

The Geshi code highlighting plugin I'm using doesn't seem to be
working correctly for large blocks of code, so unfortunately I've
disabled those blocks for now, but if you DL the attached file, you
can take a look at how I'm approaching it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comments outside the main loop
Message-ID: <e0db7f770705031936r33f513aaj5c934068a01604bb@mail.gmail.com>

Continuing on from my variable content width, I'm now trying to extend the
width based on the number of comments too. However, I've been having a bunch
of difficulties - basically, I can't loop through the comments outside of
the comments.php file.

I've tried looping through comments in the header, in the single.php, tried
using globals and includes to track them, and I've gotten nowhere. I want to
count the number of paragraphs in the comments, and change a stylesheet
variable based on that. The code that I'm using looks like this:

if ( have_posts()) {
>             while ( have_posts()) {
>                 the_post();
>                 $p = count_paragraphs(get_the_content());
>                 if ( is_home())
>                 {
>                     $p = count_paragraphs(get_the_excerpt());
>                 }
>             }
>         }



I want to include a section in there that looks like this:

> if ( $comments )
>             {
>                 foreach ( $comments as $comment )
>                 {
>                     $p += count_paragraphs(get_comment_text());
>                 }
>             }


This code is in my header.php. $p is later sent to my stylesheet as a URL
query, which then calculates the width of my content based off that.

So, if anyone has brilliant ideas, or something I've overlooked, fire away.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Passing messages to the Post Successful screen
Message-ID: <463B15B9.2040502@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

I'm writing a plugin to cross post to multiple blogs via XMLRPC. So you 
write a post on your main blog and based on the categories you choose, 
it will automatically cross post that to other blogs.

WP uses a redirect from the post submission to the "Post Successful" 
page, so I'm losing any variables I instantiate in my plugin. Thus, I 
can't add any messages under that "Post Successful" message. Can anyone 
suggest an approach to get around this issue? Or a plugin that 
successfully does it?

All suggestions appreciated,

Cheers,


Callum.

I'm starting to miss the good ol' days when search engine spam was hard 
to do...

for obscure reasons, Wordpress doesn't use sessions, so the next best 
thing for passing around some data is a cookie (as wp_redirect can't do 
custom GET variable filtering (yet?))

Hi Sabin,

Hahahaha, I'm not designing it for spam purposes. I regularly cross post 
to a few blogs because we're running Blogs instead of Planets, so this 
plugin will make that a little easier.

Thanks for the feedback, I guess a cookie might be the answer...

Cheers,


Callum.

What you've overlooked is that $comments is not setup until you
actually get to the comments.php file.

comments_template() does more than just include comments.php. It
actually get the comments from the database, builds the $comments
array, and *then* includes comments.php.

So until you call comments_template(), $comments is empty.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Restructuring Category Hierarchy
Message-ID: <463BB1B4.6040708@jamietalbot.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

As part of the taxonomy improvements that are due for 2.3, wp_categories and wp_post2cat are likely
to be removed or significantly altered, no matter what schema we end up going for (the current
proposal is at trac ticket #4189[1]).  Our current category schema is more optimised for inserts
than selects.  For subcategories for example, we either have to cache the entire category table into
a complex array, or recursively retrieve data.

A better model, more suited to WordPress ideals, is the other way round, where we take a _slight_
hit on inserts, so that we can instead select whole subsets of data very quickly.  This can be
achieved by using the Nested Set Model, described on MySQL's website[2].  That page has lots of
optimised queries for common usage which model our needs very well.  The vast majority are 4.0
compatible, with a few less common examples requiring 4.1.  Given that there is going to be a
sizeable structural shift anyway, I'd like to see us move to this new model, which should offer big
speed improvements.  API for categories will already have to change to fit the new schema, so we
should change it all in one go.

The changes basically boil down to replacing the single 'parent' column with two 'left' and 'right'
('lft', 'rght') columns.  For tagging, these columns aren't so useful, but they are for
post-category and link-category, and I can imagine other taxonomies that would also be made
possible, like linked-list.

I raised this on the ticket above, but there haven't been any responses to it there, so I'm
wondering what the hackers think?  If we miss this opportunity for change, it will be a long time
before we have another chance.

Cheers,

Jamie.

Yes, I had a poke around in comments.php, and saw how it does it. All's
working fine and dandy now, I'm just querying the database in my header and
going from there.

Thanks

WP 2.2's wp-config.php uses two directives WP_SITEURL, and WP_HOME.
And they're new to 2.2.

Yes, I noticed that a few hours ago when I committed the recent fixes
relating to those constants. I think we can change these to WP_URL and
WP_WPURL.

Am I the only one who thinks "home" is more descriptive than "url" for 
the homepage?  and that "url" and "wpurl" are too similar, and as such 
are only adding to the confusion?

I'm curious why and in what sense "url" and "wpurl" are preferred.
Just grepping lines, it looks like there are about 10 times as many
references to 'siteurl' as 'wpurl' in trunk, so it doesn't seem to be
a matter of common practice, at least in the core.

I agree.  Even someone who knows nothing about web development knows
what a site's "home" is, but "url" could refer to anything.

How about "wp_home_url" and "wp_dir_url"?

About this, I've started to get quite a lot of spam coming to the email registered on this list.
It's not used or advertised anywhere else on the web, but a quick google search results in 4
results, all from these stats emails.  I've even had people contact me directly using my list email,
looking for support instead of using the forums.  Not that it will make much difference to me at
this point, can you please improve the obfuscation a bit more, or else remove me from the stats.  I
think we're well past the point where 'username#domain.com' fooled any bots trawling Nabble.

Cheers,

Jamie.

Re: Improving Obfuscation

Security via obfuscation is useless and if we rely on it, the bots will
prevail (just like spam :)

I propose we overhaul Mailman and make it accept plaintext and encrypt
the messages on its server side to each of us via GPG :D

For instance:

Roy sends his monthly stats compilation in plain-text to
wp-hackers@lists.automattic.com

Mailman has each of our public keys and encrypts the entire convo with
each subscriber as a recipient.

We receive the message and decrypt it. Nabble butts its ugly head in,
and gets nothing but ciphertext. Same for all those nasty, evil,
necrophillic spam bots too :P

Case closed :D

I think you're probably joking with this, right?  That's a far too complex solution to a pretty
simple problem.  Not everyone has/wants/cares about a public key.  And what about the case when I'm
away from my usual box and actually want to use Nabble/MyOtherWebInterface to find previous
conversations on the list?

Cheers,

Jamie.

Hi Jamie,

I recently changes the '#', turning it into a whitespace. Is there any
better solution to this? From what I can gather, many people reply on
list and quote E-mail addresses (in explicit form) in the message
body. Arguments about hiding of one's E-mail address are similar to
X-No-Archive, where one reply to a X-No-Archive'ed post makes it
entirely visible.

I just randomly picked 7 names from the list (my lucky number).
Searching the PGP/GPG databases returned 6 matches :D

I'm glad to assume there's no resentment. For filtering, separation of
the boxes for mailing lists is something which seems to work best. You
can never assume that WWW visibility (or lack thereof) is related to
volume of SPAM because botnets have a tendency to harvest people's
address books (100-150 million zombie PCs out there, according to Vint
Ceft: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/26/botnet_threat/ )

Sadly, I have not had much time to reply on list recently (all for
good reasons). Unless there's strong/minor objection I'll carry on
with the statistics. I hope that those who are not interested just
killfile by subject line.

Message-ID: <74b84aa30705070128i45e286f1ne4cc35f67fb73001@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

WordPress has a great toolset for creating content (both WYSIWYG and
mark-up type). The only thing I see missing is a decent way of
creating tables within the content story.

Right now, the only way you can create tables is by typing out a
painful table markup. I love the way Textpattern (via Textile) allows
you to create tables (just by using pipes "|") as separators between
table contents.

Since WordPress already uses some sort of text conversion to generate
compliant markup for many things like endash, emdash, etc, is it
possible to include this table thing too? This would mean a lot more
to academic types, product/service reviewers, people who love to
create simple elegant comparison tables, people writing reports, etc.

Apologize in advance, if I am posting it in the wrong place. Thanks,
--

This would be the right place, welcome to WP-Hackers :)

I've never created tables in Textpattern, do you care to elaborate on
how it would work there?

I don't see how WP's table-creation stuff is difficult, it's standard
SQL like most other systems, though I'm not averse to making it easier
if that's possible....


///////////////////SAMPLE CODE/////////////////////////

$sql = "CREATE TABLE `$table_name` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
`transaction_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
`first_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`last_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`uri` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
`amount` double NOT NULL,
`currency` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
`dot` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);";

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I don't see how you can make that any easier yet retain the control that
you have here.

How can I specify the table name and the type without writing all out?
What about primary keys? Foreign Keys? Null/Not Null?

Though the code may be unsightly, it's pretty straight-forward with
regards to writing it... no?

I think the question was about HTML tables, not SQL tables...

You mean Alt+Shift+V? I don't see any table related buttons. Could you explain?

I would suggest using the table plugin for TinyMCE. Might be worth
adding these buttons to the advanced toolbar now that the editor in
2.3 has a button to show/hide it.

Took me a while to figure out just what the hell you were talking
about, but I get it now. You're basically talking about hierarchy in
the categories. And you're right, that is a more efficient way to do a
tree model. Selection of a whole branch basically becomes a simple
query. You get the left and right values of the category you want,
then select everything with left/right values between those two
values. Voila, you have all the children. The cost is that inserting a
category into the hierarchy requires an insert and 2 updates, while
deleting takes a delete and 3 updates. Not a huge deal, really.

The one thing that does concern me on that dev.mysql page is that they
talk about inserts and deletes, but they don't talk about rearranging
the hierarchy. A rearrangement is basically a delete followed by an
insert to another location, so you're looking at least 7 queries to do
it in the most obvious way. That seems really high.

There seems to be a high correlation between Nabble and spam.

I just assume that spammers are trolling Nabble (if I were a spammer, I'd build this service!), and use a throwaway email address that I change on a regular basis.

Since manipulating the list is not an operation done frequently, I don't
think anything can be too expensive here.
the user wont notice if it takes 20ms or 2 seconds.

Hi there,

I've got a custom table for storing information about alumni. I want
to provide a method for editing an individual's data that's accessible
only to admins and the individual in question.

I've got the data displaying perfectly (though not in a form).

Any suggestions on where to start?

Thanks!

This could well be considered completely OT, but I'm looking for some
guidance from some serious MySQL folks... so here I am.

 

I've used MS SQL for more than a decade.  I understand the regular
required maintenance it requires (at least weekly checks and
optimizations).  There is a job scheduler to make this easy.

 

Now that I'm using MySQL for more stuff, I see and have used the
"optimize table" command, but is there an equivalent of the job
scheduler so that I can tell it to just do this every so often?  I have
one db that has a table with about a million records, and it gets adds
and deletes constantly.  Clearly some kind of regular maintenance is a
good thing.

 

Thanks for your tolerance for this OT question, if you want to point me
to a more appropriate forum or to reply off-list that would be
fine/great.

 

Chris

Try the Codex:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus

Then you'll want to look at the function current_user_can(), and 
probably create your own special privilege to check whether the user 
is the correct one to edit the data.

For future reference, the best starting point for dev questions is 
"Developer Documentation", which will lead you to "Plugin Resources", 
"Function Reference", etc.

Obviously, my question wasn't clear enough, sorry for that.

I'm competent enough in PHP to write my own code but I haven't done
much with forms interacting with databases.

In my situation, I'm well outside themes/templates domain and whatnot,
but not really into the plugin domain, either, though what I have
would be a good candidate for being one, if I had the time to devote
(which I don't).

Here's what I want to do:
Have a form that's part of the site that allows users and admins to
edit info in this custom table, but outside of the standard WP admin
UI. There's not a lot of documentation on this sort of thing in the
codex, which is why I asked here.

OPTIMIZE isn't that important, you'd get more mileage out of just 
switching to InnoDB.

So, with InnoDB it's all magic and the index reorganization happens as it
goes along?  All indexes need to get adjusted as changes (especially
deletes) happen, does InnoDB do this behind the scenes?

That was always our goal (back when we were writing FoxPro) but I wasn't
aware that any DB had effectively implemented it.  I know it was
experimented with in SQL Server, but it was found that dbadmins preferred to
do it off peak.  Been out of that biz for a while, not sure if they ever
went with an engine that could do it on the fly.

I don't know what it's doing behind the scenes, but I run InnoDB tables 
with 10s of GBs of data that have never had OPTIMIZE TABLE run on them 
and they perform great.

The one table I'm concerned about isn't on a blog, but it is 6.5gb with
~1M records, so this is good info.  Off to InnoDB I go...

Thanks.

This button you speak of to show/hide the advanced toolbar.. Where is it?
I'm using a plugin to display the button atm.

Though there may be a more optimised implementation than 7 queries, you're right that it is more
complex.  However, I can't see this being a well-used feature in any case - I mean, I can see it for
 making corrections, but not more than a few times.  Besides, if you call the process 'restructure
category tree', or something, people will expect it to take a while.  After all of which, we're
still talking varying degrees of milliseconds.

It definitely will be slower to insert into this model than the existing one.  But, it definitely
will be much quicker to select from it.  That's the kind of model I'd prefer for a critical part of
the system, which is interacted with on pretty much every page load.

Does anyone have real-world experience with this kind of technique, who can provide more insight?
I'm still very keen to see this implemented.  What do core devs think of this?

Cheers,

Jamie.

I am not sure I fully understand the the proposed implementation, but I
do understand that changes will happen over many queries.
be sure to do it inside a transatcion, else wierd things will happen if
you get an error when you are half done.

Unfortunately, transactions are not available with MyISAM tables in MySQL.  There are many, many
places in WordPress that would benefit from them if they were.

You might want to schedule some downtime before changing. :-)
Converting 6.5GB of myisam table into innodb might take a while.

But then, naturally one would assume that you'd be trying this on a
development machine with a copy of the live database first, right?
:-)
And it'd be a good idea to see the pros and cons of innodb vs. myisam
tables, amongst others, as Matt pointed out, is performance increase
on heavilly indexed tables,  and transactions support, but there's a
bit of a performance hit for reading, and you lose fulltext indexes.
It'd be worth doing benchmarks on your specific instance me thinks.

MySQL has FullText support in InnoDB on their "to-do" list, though the
insider's word is that's not going to happen.

Now, I could SWEAR I read about this in so many different places, but
for the life of me I can't find a link now nor remember its name, but
MySQL is supposed to be working on the successor to InnoDB and MyISAM,
something that combines the speed of InnoDB and gives it FullText
searches amongst other things. I can't remember the name of this in-dev
tabletype, and it seems Google can't either :/

Anyone here have better memory than me? Help me out?

:)

Did it yesterday, took only about 15 minutes to do the conversion.

Read performance seems comparable or slightly better.  Interestingly, write
performance is much improved.

The one "gotcha" is that the database is now 9gb...  a 50% increase in size.
Ouch.

This comment about transactions made me wonder about the reliability of
something like the Nested List (or any linked list) approach.

With the current design, if something borks on a server when adding or
deleting a category, not a big deal--just causes the user to have to re-add
or re-delete that category.

But with the Nested List, what happens in a delete case, where the server
*coughs* just after the deletion step, but before the left and right
pointers get reset?

When you have control of your MySQL server this is probably a moot point,
but there's way too many hosts where I see stability problems with their
servers.

Is that something to be concerned about?

In MySQL 5.0 the "compact" row format for InnoDB.  Not sure which  
version you are using but that may help you get some of your space back.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/data-size.html

In our experience, converting from MyISAM to InnoDB using the compact  
row format resulted in a 20% increase in size, as opposed to the 50%  
increase you get when using the old, "redundant" row format.  I have  
heard others say that the compact row format actually took up *more*  
space than the old format, so YMMV.

That was supposed to say:

Sorry for the missing words.

Will this be possible without breaking my back? How hard would it be to

Any advice appreciated.

I've not looked at WordPress's template functions yet, so i dont know how  
easy it would be to switch to your own template system.

Methinks it's doable-- I just integrated my own blogging engine with  
Smarty relatively easily, since you don't need to mess with your  
existing framework, just open up the parts you want to use to the  
template engine.

For instance, much of what I used to open to my themes was done  
through simply defining constants. I wrote a function that does  
something like this:

$constants = get_defined_constants(true);
$userConstants = $constants['user'];
$keys = array_keys($userConstants);
$length = count($keys);

for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
	$smarty->assign($keys[$i], $userConstants[$keys[$i]]);
}

(This could also be easily accomplished with foreach ($constants as  
$key => $constant), but I chose this method for a bit of improved  
speed). Also, $smarty.const.constantName lets you access constants  
directly, I just prefer the shorter {$constantName} syntax.

Like I said, you will have to put some work into it, but since you  
don't need to change anything in the WordPress core, it's doable  
without killing yourself and/or draining a local 7-11 of their supply  
of caffeinated beverages. ;)

It is a concern - I don't use MyISAM at all outside of WordPress for this reason.  However, there
are still multiple stages in adding or deleting in the current system - we write to wp_post2cat as
well as wp_categories and wp_posts - if it borks halfway through any of that you wouldn't be happy.
 We could always use InnoDB for the new tables, which provide transaction support (as well as
referential constraints).  And there's no problem mixing the two types in the same database...  But
as is pointed out in another thread, it takes more space and is potentially slower.

Cheers,

Jamie.

I'm not sure how prevalent database borkages are, and the relatively small amount of taxonomy
management makes this a pretty low frequency problem, but yes data reliability is important.
WordPress seems to have done ok with MyISAM tables up to now (although I'm not a regular in the
forums, so I don't know the full extent).

I'm not sure if you missed the point or not - all schemas are subject to this problem because no
design will ever include a single step update process.  If there is more than one step, the update
is susceptible.  For inserting, we're talking one insert and one update, which is comparable to what
we have now.  For deleting, yes, a couple more operations than what is there now.  Unless of course
you meant you were in favour of InnoDB? :)

Cheers,

Jamie.

Hello,

I've created a SOAP interface for WordPress.  It's mostly a port of the
existing XML-RPC code.

http://www.voiceoftech.com/swhitley/?page_id=232

I'm interested in proposing this as an addition to the delivered WP code.  I
read the Codex, but I'm not 100% clear on the next step.  Should I create a
ticket for something like this?

That could talk to column types etc. though.  With some clever
normalization, you could decrease that size a bit.  CHAR vs VARCHAR
for fixed width rows etc.
I'm impressed that it took only 15 minutes.
So are you going to stick with innodb then?

Yes, a ticket with an attached source file would definitely be appropriate.

Thanks for the reply Jamie.

Today, you write a post, wp_posts gets updated, the server borks and
wp_post2cat doesn't get updated.  You notice the post has no category, but
that's easy to fix--just add that category to the post again.

In the Nested Set, following the example [1] of Adding New Nodes,  when the
server *trips* while shifting the other nodes (e.g. adding 2 to the lft and
rgt columns), it would seem any subsequent query of the tree is going to be
inaccurate, and any additions or deletions will not 'fix' the problem.
There is no recovering.

>From that standpoint, it would seem Nested Sets absolutely need InnoDB (i.e.
transactions).

Are the 'commit' developers willing to use InnoDB?

Finally, what are the implications of the LOCK TABLE in the Adding New Nodes
example?

Regards.

I'm trying to get access to the previous content of an updated post. In 
other words, if a post is being updated, I'd like a chance to query the 
old post content *before* the new content is written. I've looked at the 
save_post action, but obviously that occurs after the post has been 
updated. Looking at the source for the wp_insert_post function, none of 
the filters that are called will give me the post id. Is there a way to 
do this? I thought about creating a query based on the slug which I can 
get with the name_save_pre filter, but not sure if that's the best way.

Bill

Yeah, I meant I`m in favor of InnoDB.
however - not all mysql installations support it, its another thing to
consider.

why not manually back up the transaction in another table?
on success, remove the backup content
on failure, restore the content
if all else fails, presence of backup content on the next page load 
indicates that something failed, ask user to restore?

It looks good, but unfortunately relies on the PHP SOAP Extension which is only available for PHP 5.
 This should probably stay as a plugin.

It's as least as old as 1.5+ IIRC, so you should be ok.

Hi all, I'd like to know if there's a way to customize the default error

Thank you for the replies.    

The PHP 5 issue brings up an interesting question.  How long will PHP 4 be
supported?  I imagine there is a roadmap somewhere and there is a PHP 4
cut-off.

The truth is that there is going to be a long while until hosting companies
decide to make the transition over PHP5, besides WordPress is well-known for
being able to run *anywhere*, no mather how archaic your set-up is...
otherwise, how do you explain 2.0 support for MySQL 3.23.23 ;)

Given that 5.0 was released about three years ago, any hosting company who hasn't made the jump is clearly not a PHP-friendly host.

WordPress is one of the most important PHP applications.  If moving to PHP 5 makes WordPress better or its development easier, we should think now about announcing that version X of WordPress will require PHP 5.

I'll do some investigating into what would happen in this situation, but it might not be as
disastrous as it seems.  It would be easy to identify when an error had occurred, because we would
have two left or right values the same.  And we'd be able to check which one came first because of
the ID, so it's probably recoverable.  However, perhaps incrementing the left and right columns
before we insert would lead to less problems - I'll do some simulations of what happens when it
chokes halfway through both cases.

This is susceptible to the same problems - the server could fail before or during a backup, and
could fail on a restore as well.  There's no real way of getting around the fact that if you want to
*guarantee* a completed atomic multi-stage transaction, you have to use... well, a transaction.

No word from Devs yet on the viability for InnoDB, but they're concentrating on the release
candidates at the moment, so I guess we can revisit this after 2.2 is out the door.

Cheers,

Jamie.

On the contrary, it is because of backward compatibility that many hosting
providers still support PHP4 over 5. There are a lot of popular applications
that do not work on a PHP5 environment yet, so it is better to keep your
current customers happy and offer new ones the ability to choose what they
want.

At the moment, this is the best approach I've seen, but of course, not every
company can offer this kinds of flexibility.

Not one of the most important PHP application, but a certainly a popular
one, and it's popularity and wide adoption is due to the commitment of
WordPress with the end-user, if we take the easy road just to make
"development easier", will be letting down many users on the road, that is
not very "WP-Friendly" ;)

There are no plans currently to cut off PHP4.

One word: cPanel. cPanel is the most popular Hosting Control Panel, for
obvious reasons. But, it is *very* behind on the software it runs on. cPanel
11 (the current stable version) only works on Apache 1.3, PHP 4 and MySQL 4.
Also, when installing cPanel, it will install Apache, PHP and MySQL for you.
Then, after, hosts usually install PHP 5 as CGI and allow Customers to add a
line to their .htaccess to use it. But, PHP 4 is still set as default
because cPanel needs it to run. So, as you might imagine, most people don't
care about the PHP version or don't have the technical knowledge for
deciding to use PHP 5.

Hopefully cPanel 12 (currently in Beta) will support Apache 2, PHP 5 and
MySQL 5, but I doubt it. :P

Were you logged out when you clicked the thumbnail? Because I think you need
to be logged in to view those pages, if I remember correctly.

Hey David,

Thanks for the suggestions.

I thought about using the options table. I'm making a remote XMLRPC 
call, so I don't know if it will have completed when the post.php file 
redirects. The redirect might complete before the XMLRPC call. In which 
case, the data would get to the options table too late.

I could build some sort of Ajax thing to update live I guess, but that 
seems like a lot of work to display a simple "failed" or "succeeded" 
message! :)

Anyone got any ideas that might get round the redirect / XMLRPC delay 
problem?

Cheers,


Callum.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Improvements to the WordPress l10n framework
Message-ID: <46444626.2000403@ultinet.org>

Hi everyone,


First of all, let me open by saying that I'm pretty new to WP 
development and I don't really know the internals very well (This is why 
I'm consulting this list), so I might have mistakes among my 
assumptions. Please correct me if I do!


The current situation of WP l10n for plugins is that they may use 
load_plugin_textdomain("mydomain") and then use 
__("mystring","mydomain"), or _e() with the same syntax, for every 
interface string (Strings that are shown to the user, need to be 
translated). From what I've seen, many (Most?) plugins don't use this 
option, or use it erroneously.


For example, in the Sidebar Widgets plugin, you see many instances of 
these functions being used without specifying a textdomain. This mistake 
also repeats itself in a few other plugins I saw, not to mention the 
ones that don't use l10n at all.


The thing I want to avoid here is the "disease" that I see now, in the 
Hebrew WP community, where plugins that are otherwise perfectly fine get 
"Hebrew versions" that are just translations, and not other 
locale-specific fixes, things that can be avoided if plugin authors 
would properly support l10n, and the way I see it, that would only 
happen if the framework would support it better. The situation now 
creates unneeded branches in the code, and that's bad, especially when 
it comes to updates and upgrades.


>From what I've seen in other systems, and from my own development 
experience, I got to the conclusion that the process of making your 
plugin l10n-enabled should be simplified for developers. Wrapping your 
strings with __() is easy, but if you need to start specifying your 
domain every line, you're not going to do it. So this is where I ask 
you: How can this be done? Omry Yadan suggested this process (roughly):


Plugin init loop:

1. When each plugin is initialized, its directory is searched for a 
translation file for the current locale. If it exists, it is loaded 
under the plugin name's textdomain. A global variable (Say, 
$pluginDomain) for the current plugin's domain is set.

2. The plugin is initialized.

3. $pluginDomain is unset.


When __() or _e() are called, if a string is not found in the default 
textdomain, they try to match the string to the textdomain named in 
$pluginDomain. That will also be backwards-compatible if current plugins 
intentionally don't name a domain to get the default.


The problem with this mode of operation is that it also requires 
$pluginDomain to be set before calling any of the plugins functions, 
either by hooks, by user code (In a template) or whatever, and that's 
something I'm not sure how to do, or if it's even possible with the way 
WP works.


The other option I considered, and is really patchy, is using PHP's 
debug_backtrace() to find the file that called __() or _e() and choosing 
a textdomain using that (Again, only if the string isn't found, etc.), 
but as I said, it's really patchy and ugly and probably bad for 
performance (Not that I checked it or anything - but debug functions are 
usually bad for production code).


So, what do you say?

Why not?  A simple macro in your favourite code editor (assuming it's not notepad) can insert this
automatically.  At worst it's just copy and paste.

What is this pluginDomain determined from?

I'm a bit confused with how this will work.  How will you determine what $pluginDomain to check if
it has been unset?  How will you know which $pluginDomain to look in if there are multiple localised
plugins?  This also seems pretty slow because it means first checking the default domain, then
checking another domain (or lots of other domains).

It could probably be made to work, but like you say, it's a bit prone to failure, is pretty slow and
in any case is only available for PHP 4.3+, while WordPress requirements state 4.2.

> So, what do you say?

I'm not convinced that the current system needs any changing.  It's not too much of a stretch to
require a domain for each string.  It allows a single, simple lookup when outputting.  It helps
group translations from one theme or plugin logically.  All in all, theme and plugin authors should
just code properly.  If they don't localise properly, it won't work.  That doesn't seem unfair.  In
my opinion, we just need to educate authors better.

Cheers,

Jamie.

Shortly after I sent this I realized that querying by slug wasn't going 
to work because the slug could be different. To get it to work, I 
registered a content_save_pre filter and grabbed the $_POST['post_ID'] 
value if it's set. Obviously if it isn't set, there is no previous 
content to find. I'm still not sure though if this is the best route. 
Would a save_post_pre action make more sense?

I almost changed the subject line on this post, but I think we've about
exhausted this discussion anyway.  I'll throw out my opinion.

My background is in enterprise applications development.  Over the past ten
years I've mainly worked with the PeopleSoft ERP.  I've been through a lot
of upgrades and multiple versions of web servers, middle-tier products,
databases, etc.

WordPress is very popular, and that popularity is driving its importance.
WP is a key application for regular folks like me, but I also see it
becoming an important business tool.  People are going to expect WP to
support the newer features of PHP and MySQL. 

To provide the best support for all users, WordPress has to evolve.  It
can't evolve if it plans to support old PHP and MySQL versions forever.
That support may be seen as an advantage now, but I believe it will actually
result in a disservice to the users.  In some areas, WP won't be able to
improve due to the limitations of the old support software.  I think it's
important to create a support-software roadmap for WP.  By all means, run
WP2.1 forever on PHP 4, but when you want to upgrade to WP X, you'll need
PHP Y and MySQL Z.

I agree with this. I don't think it is a good idea to allways be backwards 
compatible with "the stone age" (to be on the edge). Of course we should not 
be on the bleeding edge either, but at least follow the evolution.

I currently work on a highly customized WordPress (mostly customized through 
plugins and theme) and I often get requests to integrate with other software 
and web services.

It is great that WordPress has such a large amount of users and I don't think 
that setting the requirements to PHP5 and MySQL5 will change that. Those who 
refuse to upgrade can continue running the latest 2.x release, while the rest 
of us run 3.x (or something).

Problem with MySQL 5 is that it's not installed on most Shared Servers. It's
almost always MySQL 4.

I think we'd be able to safely drop PHP 4 support soon. Since it's possibly
to run PHP 4 and 5 on the same server, there's no reason for not having PHP
5. I doubt we'll see this happen anytime soon in WP, though...
Unfortunately.

Yes, it is possible, but some hosting providers (like mine for
example) do offer PHP4 as default with file extension *.php; PHP5 is
triggered only on *.php5 file extensions. However once being in the
PHP5 processor also *.php are executed with it.

My point is: hosting companies do not follow a standard pattern and
are naming different settings with the same names.

But I am positive about 5-only branch :)

Hi, Jamie

I agree with you, that the current localization scheme is working as
expected. But we do need to educate the authors to properly set the
plugin domain correctly. I have spend many hours converting some
plugins or themes into domain based format. The fundamental reason is
that most authors use English on their blogs, and they would not test
the translation before releasing it. If the plugin author use
__("something"), it means he is making an effort in the right
direction, but may not know that it would be better to specify the
plugin domain.

Anyway, one area that DOES need improvement in the current WordPress
core is the way it searches and outputs the plugin names and
descriptions. Currently it is ENGLISH-ONLY. There is no way to
translate it.

I am thinking that we can probably do something like this:
1. to allow backwards compatibility, still search the strings in the
comment area for author and plugin information. (but this is English
only)

2. use a filter to replace the plugin or theme meta information.
Something like the following:


/*
Plugin Name: Anything
*/

add_filter('localization_plugin_meta', 'replace_plugin_name')

function replace_plugin_name() {
    plugins['Anything']['name'] = __('Anything','anything');
}


What are your opinions?

Best,

-Liang

My first post - hope this is the right way to reply.
Don't understand why this is a cPanel issue.
My ISP uses "cPanel Pro 1.0 (RC36)" with PHP 5.21 and MySQL 5.0.24-standard.
They still use Apache 1.3, but that's what I run at home, so it works out fine.

I think pushing WP to php5 and signaling an end to support for php4 is a
great idea. There are features and fixes in 5 that will never appear in
php4.x.

With the influence WordPress has in the PHP community, a move to support
PHP5 would send a strong message to the shared hosting community that
they have to get with the times if they want to be paid to host sites
that use WordPress. 

Having listened to some of the core PHP developers through the Vancouver
conference, there was far more talk about getting on with php6 than with
further patches to php4. And yes php5 is now over 3 years old. PHP4 is
seen more as a dead branch, patched as a courtesy. Who else finds it
ridiculous that anybody is still using php4 when php5 has been around
now for 3 years? The old excuses for not moving over just don't add up
anymore. 

As was pointed out in other comments, the issue is the shared hosting
providers. I have learned from people in the business tat there has been
a great deal of farming out of shared services to cluster farms, where
the company you deal with doesn't even host their own shared hosting.

These data services jam on as many accounts as possible on to a server,
and are set to run LAMP mirrors using php4.x and mysql3.x across
hundreds of machines. These services are Cash cows for the owners. You
can't shell in, you can't run cron, you can't have one change to
php.ini, and you cant get the benefit of a software update. And of
course when bandwidth starts to suck or performance goes down, tech
support says you need a dedicated server and passes you over to sales.
They aren't concerned that they are running embarrassingly old releases
of software. What a racket. Lucky I'm smarter than that. Other people
aren't.

While it is possible to run php4 and php5 together, few hosting services
offer it, and few know how to do it. The word needs to get out that this
is technically possible and doable in production environments. The
howtos are googleable. Unfortunately, there is never an open attitude
towards any changes to systems in these big hosting environments. It's
galling in the Information Technology industry to be stuck dealing with
business services that are incredibly resistant to change or new ideas.
They aren't interested or willing to investigate anything new related to
the services they offer. This experience is far too common. 

If the cms middleware communities started to push their weight around by
putting an end to support for php4 on the horizon, that may encourage
cPanel and Plesk along with others to follow suit. The more development
communities that start to want stop supporting php4, the easier it will
be for businesses to make the long overdue adaptation to php5x and mysql
5x. A push for change will also shake up shared hosting services - and
this is direly needed. 


Cheers,
PG

Problem with MySQL 5 is that it's not installed on most Shared Servers.
It's
almost always MySQL 4.

I think we'd be able to safely drop PHP 4 support soon. Since it's
possibly
to run PHP 4 and 5 on the same server, there's no reason for not having
PHP
5. I doubt we'll see this happen anytime soon in WP, though...
Unfortunately.

I actually wonder why this is... I even have Registration turned off and you
still have to be logged in to view the attachment.

I would disagree with this core assumption. If we're talking about 
"forever" then of course we're going to upgrade our minimum versions, 
but I don't think that's worth it in the next 4-6 months. I'm happy to 
re-examine the issue later.

I care far more about getting people on the latest version of WordPress 
than coercing them to upgrade their database or PHP software.

There is nothing we want to do in WordPress right now that's being held 
back by PHP 4, so this whole discussion is a little academic.

Another factor seems to be whether or not the attachment is directly  
associate with the parent post, or is part of the uploaded images  
library. I checked the post_parent and there seems to be an odd  
integer in there on the problematic attachments:

First of all, I think cPanel Pro is just extra cPanel features.

Again, it is possible to run both PHP 4, and PHP 5. They could have simply
put an .htaccess file in /home/ (or wherever user's account files are
stored) to make all users be on PHP 5.

I have also seen both MySQL 4 and 5 installed on the same server. It's a bit
tricky though.

Mosts hosts that have both PHP 4 and 5 installed allow you to switch to PHP
5 by adding this code to .htaccess that can be placed outside of public_html
(if you want it to affect your *whole* account), or on a per folder basis:

AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php

OP:
This is really nice for "most" hosts, but mine (arrrgh) is not
offering such an option. They also don't offer 'lock tables' and
'create temporary table'. If I knew all this before I got them I would
never take them.

Speak for yourself.  Perhaps this will sound a bit harsh, but there
are people out there who actually know how to code and know PHP5, and
there is plenty they'd like to do with it.

It seems like it'd be nice to add "as long as it doesn't significantly
retard WP development" to that.  Supporting and testing two major versions
of PHP comes at some cost, and PHP 6 is coming.

Also, when WordPress still doesn't/can't depend on a 3-year-old version of
PHP, that sends several negative messages about PHP.  It strikes me that one
of the major reasons that hosts haven't updated to PHP 5 is that they can
get away with it.  At this rate, I'm afraid we won't be able to take
advantage of proper I18N support in WordPress until 2012.

Yes, but then if you make a Plugin that relies on PHP 5 to run then people
will email you asking why your plugin isn't working, because they're using
PHP 4. Even if you make a note of it in the readme or w/e, people still will
try to use it on PHP 4.

I made a proposal regarding this on Trac[1] (my comments as majelbstoat), which is backwards
compatible and allows name, description and URI to be changed, by making them part of the POT file.
 That's about 10 months old now, with no feedback...

Cheers,

Jamie.

And that's why we have a nice RTFM speech ;)

Now seriously, that's the expected behavior, you get the core to run
everywhere, including a powerful api and a flexible db schema (on the way).
Plugins are "extra features", so if you want to extend the core, maybe you
will need to meet higher requirements.

That can be used as an excuse to write any bad API.
"ah, they can just use an IDE macro!"
did you ever transform a plugin that does not support i18n, or have
partial support (calls to __() and _e() without a domain) into a
correctly localized plugin?
its not fun, and its not pretty.
consider the difference between:
$str = "There are ".$x." new messages";
to:
$str = __("There are ").$x.__(" new messages");

pretty close.
now, what does this do the the code readability?

$str = __("There are ","foobar plugin").$x.__(" new messages","foobar
plugin");

even if plugin authors were aware of this option (and they are not),
many will not use it simply because makes the code uglier.
you can argue that they can create a function like:
function fb__($str) {return __($str,"foobar-plugin");}
and call it instead, and you will be right, but I still think the domain
specific translation for plugins should be initialized and provided by
the platform.

That's implementation detail.

The idea is to have the correct domain active at the correct context.
when calling the code of a particular plugin, its translation should be
loaded and be made available through the standard __() and _e().

the only problem is that when the platform is calling hooks code, I
don't think it knows which plugin "owns" that code, so it can't possibly
make the correct translation available for it.
maybe the right solution would be to flatten the entire translation
space into a single hashtable, and load the plugins translations into it
as well.

Of course I have - multilingualism is my special interest.  I maintain Gengo, a multilingual plugin.
 I also run wp-multilingual.net, - I rewrote connections reloaded to be correctly localised and no,
it wasn't pretty.  This isn't WordPress' fault, it was incorrectly localised.  The API isn't bad
just because authors can't be bothered/don't know how to use it properly.  It's not difficult,
people just don't know about it - hence my suggestion for better education.

Well firstly, they shouldn't do that anyway, because word order between different languages is
totally different.  What they should do is:

$str = sprintf(__("There are %s new messages", 'foobar_plugin'), $x);

Which I find very easy to read.

That's fine.

"Have the correct domain active at the correct context" - if you can actually explain how to do
this, I would be very excited.  You specify unsetting pluginDomain, at which point you lose context.
 And you surely realise that plugin strings are only translated as required, so we don't know the
context.

Exactly - we don't know which plugin 'owns' which string, which means we have to search a
potentially huge translation space for every string.  Why not then just do away with domains
altogether?  I'm not coming at this with no experience, and I'm not being deliberately negative -
just that your solution isn't really a solution at all.  I genuinely would be very interested if you
can supply concrete implementation details for your suggestion.

You are right of course, but there are other examples (for example when
embedding php translations directly into html code) where it will make a
difference.

look at the attached file, it contains a very basic prototype.
extract it into your web server dir and run do-stuff.php.

the idea is the code that initializes the plugins initialize a global
called $plugin_id before calling the plugin init code.
when the plugin adds an action, it will pass that global to the
add_action function, that will use it to re-obtain context when calling
the actions.
it can easily be improved further, so that the plugins does not need to
pass the plugin_id to the register function simply by letting the
add_action function access the global directly. (I didn't do it because
its harder to understand, and this is just an example).

function add_action($action_type, $callback, $plugin_id)
{
   ///
}

function add_action($action_type, $callback)
{
    global $plugin_id;
    ///
}

this makes the fair assumption that add_action is only called from the
plugin init code.

Hello guys,

I was thinking for a long time of this problem and was on the verge of
raising the issue in front of you all, but somebody got here first :-)

If we are to summarize our goal: the plugin developers should not have
to write their gettext domain name in every __/_e call.

2007/5/12, Omry Yadan <omry@yadan.net>:

We cannot do this. What happens if the plugin function calls a core
function and then it calls other plugin function? It is possible that
either core strings are being searched for in the plugin domain or,
worse, one plugin\s string is being looked for in other plugin's
domain.

Given that PHP lacks namespaces the task just cannot be accomplished easily.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

There are people who know how to code and know Python as well, that

Don't mistake me for advocating that we switch everything to PHP5, I'm
in agreement on sticking with PHP4 for a while yet, but don't group
the whole dev community with you on thinking there's nothing that PHP4
is holding back. Its insulting. :)

Good point.
it can be solved (I think) by using a stack.
instead of setting and unsetting the current plugin_id, push it and pop
it from a global stack.

I don't know, what say ya'll?

I think it's looking pretty good and ready to roll.  We just need to
verify the RC2 fixes, especially the PHP 5 compatibility stuff.  We've
been merging this stuff up to wordpress.com daily, and it is behaving
well.

Was wondering if there was an easy way to do this? Was thinking about

Something maybe I can slap into the functions.php file and not need a

I think I got it now.. seems to be working :D ... From this guy's blog 
here after google searching..
http://www.willoller.com/limiting-title-and-excerpt-length-with-wordpress/

MINUS Excerpt Reloaded plugin activated...  I slapped the below code in 
functions.php file:

<?php

function the_title2($before = '', $after = '', $echo = true, $length = 
false) {
         $title = get_the_title();
 
      if ( $length && is_numeric($length) ) {

             $title = substr( $title, 0, $length );

          }

        if ( strlen($title)> 0 ) {

             $title = apply_filters('the_title2', $before . $title . 
$after, $before, $after);

             if ( $echo )

                echo $title;

             else

                return $title;

          }

      }



?>

Then used this for in the index.php file:

<h1><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent 
Link to <?php the_title(); ?>"><?php the_title2('', '', true, '30') 
?></a></h1>

Now it's cutting the post's title off at 30 characters.. whee!! Oh God 
I'm awesome.. I just can't stress it enough.. lol.. hahaha

Well, actually it's more then 30 chars I believe... but it's still doing 
what I wanted ;) :) :D

Now that I've seen some code and understand how context will be retained, this isn't necessarily a
bad idea.  You are of course, swapping the need to specify a domain on each string to specifying a
domain on each filter/action, but in the majority of cases there will be a lot fewer.  If a
stack-based implementation can be worked out, this might work well - I suspect this will be more
difficult than it sounds, however.  And, instead of using a speculative plugin domain, why not let
plugin authors decide their own?  The suggestion I made on Trac for specifying a plugin domain in
the plugin header would be ideal for this[1].

Your mechanism of adding domains to filters would also incidentally allow improvements to did_action
which I'd really like to see, but which we have no current way of doing.  In fact, it's exactly what
I wished we already had[2]!

Cheers,

Jamie.

Now that you understood what I meant, take another look at the file 
(http://hcoop.net/~omry/plugins.zip).

the current version does not require that the user specifies the domain 
when registering the action.


The stack solution will only work if the plugins does not directly call 
each-other, but through actions.

Generally, we should also consider how functions 'overridden' by plugins 
will maintain the context.


I`ll try to hack a solution with the stack soon, which should allow one 
plugin to call do_action('...') and continue to maintain the context 
correctly.

Using a stack we can only reassure we are not in the wrong plugin.
However we cannot intercept the switch between a plugin and the core.
Here is an example:
wp-content/plugins/our.php:
    function f() {
        ....
        $x = comments_number();
        ....
    }

In the comments_number function there are some i18n-ed strings and we
expect their translations to be taken from the default domain. However
the current context will point us to our plugin and the translation
will be searched for in its domain, not in the default.

In most of the cases we can solve this problem by searching not only
in the plugin namespace, but on failure -- also in the default one. Of
course, this will work only if we are sure that one string has the
same translation everywhere.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Well, I can claim this is a feature that allow plugins to override core 
translations in while their context. :)
in any case, I fully agree that the search should fallback to the core 
on failure, something like:

function __($s)
{
    global $plugin_id;
    if (isset($plugin_id))
    {
       $t = old__($s, $plugin_id);
       if (empty($t)) $t = old__($s);
       return $t;
    }
    else
    {
       return old__($s);
    }
}

This isn't really directly related to WP development, but I'm  
wondering if anyone with WP/clustered experience has ever used  
MogileFS (from the creators of memcached) to distribute "stuff". By  
"stuff", I'm thinking specifically of images uploaded via the image

I still don't think it is the Right Thing To Do (tm), however it could
prove sufficient for our needs.

You could start a ticket and put the code there, so that we don't
forget about it :-)

Happy hacking,

With wordwrap(), if the original content is a non-english one,
wordwrap can almost surely insert line break in the middle of
a multibyte character, thus breaking the whole content horribly.

I updated the example to use a stack.

now each plugin registers two actions:

"some_action" and "another_action".

when the do-stuff.php file calls do_action("some_action"), each plugin
call do_action("another_action") from its own action callback.

the result seems to be working correctly.

Hi, Jamie

Thanks for pointing out the ticket. I think it is a very important
thing to make WordPress appealing to more people in other countries.
Playing with different themes and plugins are the great fun of
WordPress, isn't it? Why make it English only?

Best,

-Liang

I believe it will be minimal.  There is a lot of speedup in selectors,
as well as "full" CSS3 support, full JSON support and a crapload of
other coolness.

Definitely makes 1.5 look OnB.  *grin*

I meant plugins that comes with their own (older) version of prototype. 

FireStats is one such plugin, and I know of at least one theme that
comes with prototype (Vistered little).

Those themes/plugins are already broken/not 2.1 compatible.

They need to be updated to *not* include prototype and scriptaculous,
but to use the built in ones in 2.1 and up, along with the new code to
prevent loading duplicate javascripts.

Another factor: Upgrading to Prototype 1.5.1 also means upgrading to
scriptaculous 1.7.1 beta 2, to avoid recursion problems.

Is anyone testing with PHP 5.2.2?  How about with 5.1.x or 5.2.x and
plugins that use output buffers?  I'm hoping the php5 compat problems
are ironed out now.

In my limited testing with PHP 5.1.6, I have not encountered any  
noticeable issues. I admit my testing has been cursory though, but  
widgets work and the rest of the major features added for this  
release _seem_ to work.

Well, FireStats works fine with 2.1, and it does include prototype.

go figure.

Apache 2.2.3, PHP 5.2.1 with APC. I haven't had any problems yet (even with
WP-Cache running on it). Only thing I have noticed is that Javascript/CSS
problem in IE7 for widgets. Someone already opened a ticket on it. It is
more appearance than anything.

Hi , could an expert advise me on this.

(Linux hosting) - I know it is ideal to have same versions for both, but 
I don't have control of this... what are the implications, if any?

I'm not sure what you mean by "client version."
If that's the version of phpMyAdmin your host has running, it shouldn't
make a difference...

MySQL doesn't have "clients" so much as libraries - WordPress uses the
PHP MySQL Driver to connect to the MySQL database - be it MySQL 3, 4, or 5.

Never had _any_ PHP 5.x issues with WordPress - maybe it's because I run
Windows :D

Windows Server 2003 SP2, IIS 6, PHP 5.2.2, IIRF, eAccelerator, MySQL 5.1.

ZLIB tested on both IIS level and PHP level.
Ouput buffering (with and without ZLIB) tested just fine.


No issues to speak of - great job! :)

(I already emailed Mark, but for anyone who cares: Kramer is b0rked
under WP22)

I was referring to libmysql.dll or the linux equivalent - I am not 100% 
sure myself about this, so any explanation would be good! How does php 
talk to the server? does it go via this "client"
thanks

So long as phpMyAdmin is connecting to MySQL (you don't get any errors,
it doesn't say MySQL server not found, etc.) then you don't have
anything to worry about.

WordPress uses the same method as phpMyAdmin. This conversation is
probably more suited for the support forums at wordpress.org than the
mailing list, btw.

Probably non-conflicting function calls or overwritten headers.

It uses the Ajax functionality and some of the basics ($(), $F() etc) 
inside the admin section of wp.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding Query Var for Post
Message-ID: <4649A779.4020105@copperleaf.org>

Hi all,

I'm playing with a plugin that needs to add a query var to a link within 
the_content of a post. I've been able to do that in my test environment 
with get_permalink() . "&version=3"  which results in something like 
http://localhost/?p=10&version=3. When using permalinks, I can't blindly 
add &version=3. I've been playing with the using_xxx_permalink methods 
and it appears that I can simply append ?version=3 when 
using_permalinks() returns true and append &version=3 when it returns 
false. Is this the correct approach?

TIA,
Bill

I would use WordPress's own add_query_arg function instead.

PHP must be compiled against a different MySQL library. The host probably
has more than one copy of libmysql on the machine. Quite mysterious, really.
I'm not sure what compatibility issues are going to be here (will the MySQL
client library 4.1.x take 5.0.x commands?), but you might ask your host to
investigate further.

I think if you want people to try to use one standard include file, you've
got to keep it up to date, at least with the most recent stable version.  If
I were developing a plugin that used Prototype today, I would package my own
because I don't want to develop on 1.5.0_rc0.  There have been a lot of
important improvements since then.

Hello,

I need a bit of direction.  I'm getting an "Invalid Server Response" error
with Windows Live Writer, even with all plug-ins disabled, with WP 2.1.3.
The more verbose form of the error is:

	"The response to the metaWeblog.newPost method received from the
weblog server was invalid."

With Qumana, I get:

	"Error decoding XML-RPC response. Content is not allowed in prolog."

Before I do a grade-and-pave (a clean reinstall), is there any other
information that I can provide to help someone debug this?

Your ISP has version 5.0.24 of MySQL server running (the server). When 
you are using PHP, then PHP connects to the MySQL server as the client, 
using whatever library it was compiled with (in your case 4.1.10). There 
is no issue with using an older client version of the libmysql, except 
perhaps that you don't get the performance benefits of using a newer 
client version.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Categories in reverse order
Message-ID: <464B2D1B.9010506@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi, I'm trying to understand a strange behaviour experienced in my Wordpress (2.2 stable). When I call 

the_category()

in my theme, it shows categories in reverse order: first children and parent after. Is this a problem related to my settings somewhere? With WP 2.1 everything was ok.

Example:

- Category1
 * subCategory1
 * subCategory2

(at the end of my posts with Wp 2.1) filed under category1 > subCategory1
(at the end of my posts with Wp 2.2) filed under subCategory1 > Category1

I restored a backup of my DB in the meanwhile (and upgraded to 2.2 again), but nothing changes.
Thanks,
dino.

Hi again, digging into the source code, I found what is making the_category() display things in a wrong way (for me, at least):

 if ( !empty($categories) )
	usort($categories, '_get_the_category_usort');

in wp-includes/category-template.php row 76. Commenting the usort call, everything is fine. Could you please help me?

Thanks.

Tags.

I think we should look a lot at the front-end performance of WP:

http://www.skrenta.com/2007/05/14_rules_for_fast_web_pages_by_1.html

We should make update notification for core WP more robust, possibly 
including sending an email to admin_email.

Consider bundling a new theme, two that come to mind are Regulus and 
Sandbox. (This would be in addition to, not replacing Kubrick.)

We should shoot for some sort of update notification system for plugins. 
It would be neat if the email sent to admin_email about a new version 
included a note about which plugins were compatible or not.

Of course we should continue to make design and usability improvements, 
and improve speed, security, and scalability as we become aware of issue.

Where's the discussion of how tags will work in 2.3 going on?

I ask because I'm pretty invested in tags (see example site below),  
and I'd love to bend my work towards whatever is baseline.

http://beyondbrownpaper.plymouth.edu/browse/

Short explanation: the tags on that site are used in the faceted  
search and browse (the stuff in the right column, not just the stuff  
labeled "tags"), and they're a bit more like flickr's machine tags  
than plain-old-tags. I'm crossing my fingers that the new tag data  
structure will support what I'm doing.

cycle) have every major code change within the first 40 days? Then  
after 80 days enter a feature freeze? That thereby leaves another 40

I absolutely agree. There should be a feature freeze at least one month
before the scheduled release.

I'd say Sandbox. Also, are there any plans for taking out the Classic theme,
possibly replacing it with Sandbox?

I'm +1 for the concept, but maybe, say, 60 days (~ 2 months) for new
features? Keep in mind that also includes debating the feature, how it will
be implemented, and so on. I like the idea of feature-freezing for QA,
though.

I think the Classic theme should stay. Not many people use it, but
there are piles of theme building tutorials that base examples on
either Classic or Default. Classic is slim and light and some people
use strip it down further and use it as a framework for their own
designs. I think it's versatile exactly because it's so basic.

:) i'm doing that as a plugin for now as part of GSoC:
http://groups.google.com/group/wordpress-soc-2007/web/wordpress-update-plugin?hl=en

You can expect to see some kind of public code just after SoC starts (ie.  
after uni exams are over)

Isn't that the point of Sandbox, though? Sandbox is likely *the* most
versatile theme out there, and is a great starting point for creating your
own theme.

Building on that, is it too far-out to think about automated downloads and
installations?  (With the user's permission, of course.)  I've seen
information for automated installation on the WordPress Plugin Database
form, but I haven't seen any documentation on how to use it.

It'd be trickly to make that work in 95%+ of server setups.

I love Sandbox and I think it's a great candidate for inclusion. But
Classic is likely a lot more accessible for people with less design
skill. I think both themes can have a place.

Sure, but let's ship and iterate rather than try to do it all at once.

I personally think the list of features to focus on should be taken from the
top of the most requested / highest rates "ideas" from the ideas page:
http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas. All ideas that are decided to be added to
wordpress core should be chosen from the top of that list and worked
downwards. This will prove to the community that the developers are
interested in implementing ideas that they (the users) care about. Anything
else would suggest that the developers were merely soliciting ideas and
don't necessarily care about what a majority of the users are clamoring for
(self-defeating in nature).

So my vote would be for plugin update notification then easy updating of
wordpress. Although I don't necessarily agree with the idea, I think people
have clearly expressed that they want to know when a plugin needs to be
updated (and I could only hope they would want that to be upgraded by a
simple button click as well).

That's precisely why it makes such a compelling feature.  This has to
be one of the most-often requested features that I have seen
mentioned.

I think even half of it would be a great improvement on the current
state of things - the notification of
old/outdated/security-bug-plagued plugins.

#5 - Default searching of posts AND pages - oughtn't be too hard.

Quick spitballing on the updating of plugins - a single link at the
bottom/top of the plugins page that hits the plugin repo, creates a
zipfile containing all relevant plugin files and prompting the user to
download it, allowing them to upload/update at their leisure.

I believe a better draft system is in the works, courtesy of Mark Jaquith.
Or, if not, I'd be glad to work on that.

Or, revamp of Blog Roll, but I don't see that happening any time soon. ;)

It didn't get much interest from Matt, though. If you want to rally people
up, I'm not going to mind :).

You see, we don't do it because it's easy, but because it's hard.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure Mark was working on something, or at least planned 
to then... I think he mentioned about this in a reply the other month, 
when I re-bumped the original discussion I started on it. :D If you 
three (Mark, Rob1n, and Aaron) work on that puppy... I know it will rock 
n knock the socks right off folks. :D lol

Yeah, well... not everyone will or would agree with that. After all, 
it's taking away "mad props",  and we can't forget the PR!! However, 
this isn't about stripping "them" (those folks currently listed on 
there) as such, to do "them" harm or whatever.

People like "change" from time to time. So, rather then it be looked at 
as "big" humongous ripping of their PRs, and ripping their links off 
"just because"... how about looking at it from another point of view? 
And that's replacing those links with USEFUL links, to various useful 
resources that people need the most?

Especially after an install! It's basically the first thing listed on 
there for Lord's sake LOL. If Dolly or Donny Dumbass gets their install 
done FINALLY after numerous repeated questions and stuff in the 
forums... and they get a Blog Roll with nothing but links to people's 
sites they really don't give a squat about to begin with, how's that 
going to help too?

IMHO, if I was a nOOb, after getting the installation done... I'd rather 
see links there such as:

Codex
Podz's Tuts Page
WordPress Support forums (even though those links are inside the 
wp-admin panel, all over. People might notice them right away, but it'd 
be the first thing they'd see though once getting to index page)
Theme Viewer(s)
Plugin link(s) (For codex section and or main plugin repository.)

And whatever else anyone thinks is useful. After all, most of the time 
when people get done with their installations, they think "Ok, now how 
do I change this theme!?" Or, "Ok, now how can I tweak this theme to do 
what I want it to do?!", Or, "Where can I get mods/plugins for this new 
awesome WP blog of mine!?"...

Rather then them having to find there ways around to certain specific 
locations on the .ORG site, it'd be right there, smack dab on their 
index page of new installation! Well, what ya know.. that's more helpful 
then links to people's sites they don't really want to read anyway... 
whee! LOL

Besides that, like I suggested here too>
http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=560&page&replies=14#post-2725
And here>
http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=560&page&replies=14#post-2729

They can even "make" a Contributor section in the dashboard index, or, 
whatever. Give them a little special place in there maybe? Also, please 
don't forget! There is of course this page here: 
http://wordpress.org/about/ besides the Dashboard itself that holds a 
good number of reads from those already in the default Blog Roll.

This whole discussion, (which Wank originally brought up and everyone 
knows about) isn't intended to slight anyone as such. It's to hopefully 
HELP the nOObs a little better. As well as provide "change" to the Blog 
Roll. Again, IMHO... it would be far more useful with helpful useful 
links, then just reads of Contributors. Not saying you're boring guys, 
but from a nOOb's point of view, I really don't think they'd care or 
give a flying willy about those links... LOL :P

They want HELP! "Help me dammit, I need this, I need that, can you do 
this for me please?" *Stop the madness, make it simpler!* Okay, I think 
I'm done... for now anyway... LOL..

Agreed. Speaking of draft management, my teams would love to see  the  
ability to post directly to Draft mode via xml-rpc (e.g. to use ecto  
for working on media-rich drafts, then posting them to a WP site  
still in draft mode so they can be reviewed by editors).

I really like creating tags on the fly on the 2.3 alpha test install I have.
Much like creating "categories" on the fly at wordpress.com (I know cats and
tags are "not" the same). Question is does the new tag system interface with
something like the tecnorati tag system?

Those links wouldn't really fit for the Main Blog, but in the Admin they
would. Because why would the Blog's viewers need to see those links. Of
course most people would get rid of those links. :P

"proudly powered" should just become "powered". Why bring opinions into it?
If they want to put proudly, they can edit the theme. We should just keep it
generic.

As for the current blogroll, it's fine, in my opinion. Most people will just
get rid of the default links and replace them with their own. Just like the
default post and the default comment. Or just get rid of the default links
all together, maybe put them in the Admin.

I agree with the generic part of it and all, and yes, most will just 
delete them anyway. And another yes, they are still in the admin panel. 
:) If those links were just going to be deleted anyway, would it matter 
then if they were changed to something at least a little more useful 
then what's there now though? LOL

I mean, think about it once though. Once their install is DONE. They go 
to view blog. They see blog roll... they think.. "CRAP LINKS.. they 
don't help me none! Delete time!!" If they were useful, they'd possibly 
be thinking.. "Oh!! I'm going to hold on to these suckers!" :P

Even though they are already in the Admin panel, most of them don't 
really take the time to view everything in there, and perhaps even over 
looks them all too. Heck, even I've done that already. Just totally 
forgot about them there, cause you're so into doing the normal blog 
back-end dealings that you don't even think about looking for that stuff.

I see what you're saying though, and see your points. I can agree with 
your's too though. Just was throwing out other alternatives for those 
links, that's all. Not just for the sake of slighting them awesome 
folks. But for a little "change up", and for a "change up" with useful 
links. ;) :)

Either way though, this is just a discussion of/with thoughts, 
suggestions, opinions, and such coming forth for everyone to debate and 
discuss about. ;) :) Hell, till 2.3 goes out the door.. there's a lot of 
chance for discussion(s) and things going into action. If this is one 
that does not make it, then so be it. ;) I have to admit though, I'm one 
of those folks that deletes those links, but I always keep a link 
pointing to wordpress.org though. ;) :)

And I also DO READ those contributor blogs. :) Even though I don't 
usually comment on them lol. Yeah, I'm probably considered a "fan boy", 
but, after the stuff I wrote in here and previous one.. I'm a "rebel fan 
boy" .... LOL. Well, a little bit anyway.. hahaha.. :P Ah well..

"Opinions" is one of the things that I love about open source
software.  "Powered by WordPress" sounds almost machine-generated.
"Proudly powered by WordPress" makes it all more human, if you ask me.

It's true, many people will edit this out complete or change it to
something that suits them better.  But I think "Proudly powered by
WordPress" makes for an excellent default. :)

I also think the "proudly" should be removed. After all, who is proud?
The server, the database, or the PHP code? It just makes no sense. Or
should it read "The WordPress developers are proud that this site runs
WordPress" or "The WordPress developers are proud of their work, and
here you can see it"? ;)

A simple "Powered by WordPress" sounds cooler in my ears.

Best,
Alex

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.2 possible issue around add_submenu_page
Message-ID: <1179403552.m2f.33868@www.galleryembedded.com>

Greetings,

I been getting a number of forum posts complaining of 404 (missing file errors) in the WPG2 admin pages in WP 2.2 

It seems, somehow WP is translating the add_submenu request from wpg2/g2admin into wpg22Fg2admin.php (note the 2f being hex for /)

I suspect (since I cannot reproduce this issue) that the issue is around either the add_submenu_page('wpg2/g2admin.php', or add_menu_page functions but cannot see any changes in 2.2 thus why I am at loss over why this (old soon to be phased out code) is suddenly failing in 2.2

Any insights welcome..

Then why did tagging go in so late into 2.2?

It shouldn't be a goal, rather as much a requirement.

Hi All,

I just noticed that messages to this list are published online with no
SPAM protection for emails.  The URL is: http://bbpress.blogspot.com/

I myself don't care much (can't live these days without SPAM filter
anyway), but I thought that maybe it was important to some of you.
Maybe the maintainer of that blog is reading the list or something...

P.S.: Signature links are href-ed though :)

There's plenty of achives like that. Just search your favourite search
engine for "wp-hackers". This is why I use an e-mail address that
expires after one year. (Spam filters, too, of course.)

Best,
Alex

If you are using mod rewrite to 301 your site url to something other
than what is in your SiteUrl or Home url, you can sometimes got oddness
like this.

That might be a place to look....

It might not be in the core, but I'm sure someone will code up an importer
for it.

I post to Draft mode via xml-rpc now.  Is there a limitation in ecto that
doesn't allow you to post in Draft mode?

I second Leonid's comment. I remember when I was searching for a blogging
engine for my website. The friendly informal text used everywhere in
Wordpress seemed so unique that I never even tried out other software. Every
software says "Powered By blah blah.." but the word "Proudly" emphasises the
fact that we love the software :)

Hi,

"Opinions" is one of the things that I love about open source
software.  "Powered by WordPress" sounds almost machine-generated.
"Proudly powered by WordPress" makes it all more human, if you ask me.

It's true, many people will edit this out complete or change it to
something that suits them better.  But I think "Proudly powered by
WordPress" makes for an excellent default. :)

To me "Proudly" kind of stands in for "Powered by WordPress because it
was what I wanted", emphasizing how WP is driven by it's users, rather
than "Powered by XXX because it's what the tech guy at XCorp learned
at trade school" or something similar. It's also pretty relaxed as far
as opinions go, not even approaching any of the politics around free
software etc. that get the bile rising in some people.

I agree that just "powered by" sounds really mechanical, if it needs
to be changed it should be to something like "this site runs on
WordPress" or "this site runs on the WordPress blogging platform",
which is clearer and still friendly (and friendliness is important
here IMHO, when you want people to use forums and sketchy wiki's as
support you have to remind them how friendly you are regularly ;)

It is a while off, but I thought I would plant the seed now for
WordPress 2.3 to be branded as WordPress 3.

Why?
* Will have been ~ 2 years since WP 2 and a major version number
represents the significance of the progress of the WordPress
experience.
- Clue of security update support for at least a couple of years?
- Tagging will be a reason to update every theme.
* Allow people to get paid to author new books ;-)

I think performance is key (especially if it gets rebranded 3.0).  
moving wp-cache as a bundled/supported plugin, other core cleanup and 
optimization, minimization of reprocessing big blocks of text constantly 
(this was a concept to store the processed content in another field, 
maybe with a user-specified refresh or something), etc.

I'll continue to push for strong perf improvements in the core 
(including via 'core plugins') that help shared environment users, as 
things like the object cache don't generally.  I liked the recent 
discussion of trying to take advantage of mysql caching on shared 
systems -- that's another interesting approach.

Only if WP plans to continue to support 2.3 after 2.4 comes out. If  
2.4 is the next release that gets ongoing maintenance, then 2.4  
should be branded WP 3.

FWIW, I always remove the "proudly". Might be a linguistic/cultural/wossname
difference, but "proudly" in that context isn't a word I'd use. 

And can we have a UK English variant with something different instead of
"Howdy"? Or is that one just me?

I stand corrected. Was going on old information, when MovableType  
needed special config tweaks to make this work and the common  
explanation was that XML-RPC did not support it. And the Draft mode  
option in ecto is tucked away where I never noticed it (until now),   
so I  thought the same limitation affected WP. Nevermind, thanks.

I've always laughed at "Howdy!" because I put that in the Textpattern  
importer and it seems to have stuck and made it into other areas of  
WordPress too. :-p Whoever knew that would end up being so viral?

Of course, someone else might have used it too and I'm not aware of  
it, but I don't mind taking the credit/blame. :-p

I think a shift to '3' ought to be accompanied by a significant
rearchitecting, with all the attendant downsides and advantages.
There ought to be a lack of hindrance on the part of the devs in
breaking old functionality in pursuit of better performance, new
features, etc.

Just my 2 Euro pence.

To further expand upon the notion of WP 3.0, I think a few simple
questions need to be asked:

1) What would we consider iterative/evolutionary changes to WP?

2) What would we consider revolutionary?

3) What does the current WP framework prevent us from doing?

4) How willing are we to toss out old code, even going so far as to
rearchitect things such as hooks, triggers, The Loop, etc.?

5) What features are we missing that other blogging software has?

6) How far are we willing to take the "WP-as-CMS" notion?

7) Can WP still be considered simply a blogging tool?  (I think this
one is currently a hearty "no")

8) What if scaling BACK on features actually makes sense?  How do we
sell that message?

There are tons more, I'm sure, but those are just a few off the top of my head.

In my opinion, jumping version numbers is uncalled for; unless a total
rewrite is done (or a significant part). For some reason it is done by many
programs, for no reason. Versioning should always go in order. Eg. 2.0->2.1-
>2.2->2.3->2.4->2.5->2.6->2.7->2.8->2.9->3.0.

I think that this should only be done if WP is going to be significantly
different. Eg. Making it faster, better DB structure, new bundled themes,
possibly more bundled plugins (WordPress.Com Stats plugin), changes to the
Admin panel, etc.

Otherwise, I think we should go ahead versioning as usual.

Maybe we need to consider history of blogging platforms and follow  
suit. So we jump to version 3 as an older platform has done, and we  
can start charging for licenses and switch to perl?

A jump to 2.5 would be better than 3.0

Same, the only SPAM I've gotten (probably not from being on this list) that

I think some of the responses focus on the perspective of us
developers -- I know this is the wp-hackers list ---, as opposed to
how  the other audiences will interpret the version number.

Versioning ultimately comes down to a marketing issue.

Seriously, not that I am writing a book, but "WordPress 3" would be
far, far easier to get financing for than 2.3 or 2.5.

I completely agree that the 1st gate as Aaron put it is "only if [we]
plan to continue to support 2.3 after 2.4 comes out."

Cheers,
Lloyd

Does this mean WP is now ready to be properly multi-lingual or will  
third-parties keep on making their own language files the moment a  
new release comes out, sometimes with clashing versions and (like  
it's happening right now with Spanish) fligthing over licensing issues?

I have never liked the idea that there are ten subversions in a  
version. This also flies against all practical evidence. I think the  
problem is probably thinking of subversions as decimals. 2.10 and  
2.27 are valid version numbers.

What triggers a full version change is not that we've reached .9  
before, but, traditionally, that there are fundamental changes, both  
visible and architecturally, that mean we're dealing with a new  
program, not a minor evolution but one with substantial differences  
to the previous one.

A good example would be Gallery. I think the only thing they kept  
from version 1.x to 2.x was some logo files. Everything else was re- 
architected to a degree that there are effectively two branches now.  
1.x still gets updates while the main focus is 2.x.

If you're talking money then 2.9 is followed by 3 (or, rather, 2.99  
by 3). If you're talking versioning, you keep pumping out sub- 
versions while you keep fixing the program (2.x.x). New features are  
marked by minor version revisions (2.x) and major features and  
changes are marked by major versiones (X.0)

Agreed. As long as it means big changes (but not major). I would've  
branded 2.2 as 2.5 just with the inclusion of widgets and the  
comment_form hooks and the rest of the stuff.

Sorry, that makes no sense. And, no, the fact that Mozilla/Firefox did
it, doesn't make it better. ;) I think you either have a new major or a
new minor version, and whatever it is, you iterate the major or minor
version number by one.

There's no correlation between the major version number/name and a large or total rewrite.  Although minor version/build numbering is generally an engineering decision, major version updating is almost always a marketing decision.

Skipping 2.3 and 2.4 is marketing as well.  It's just not very effective, because it doesn't really mean anything that anybody can agree on.

"WordPress 3" has universal meaning -- Pay Attention, Because Something Significant Has Changed.

For example, given that WordPress is a couple years being with support for tags, a version of WordPress with core support for tags is certainly worthy of a major version bump.  Another not-entirely-marketing-driven reason for a major version bump could be a significant change in underlying requirements (e.g. PHP 5).

I love all the "Howdy"s and "Slow down, cowboy" messages; the "Hello,
Dolly" plugin; and all that jazz. (Pun intended)

It gives WordPress a very unique personality, and for me it adds to the
blogging experience.

They're not decimal numbers. In reality, they tend to go 2.0 -> 2.1 ->
etc. -> 2.8 -> 2.9 -> 2.10 -> 2.11

I'm not really trying to "spitball it" because I think it would definately
be a step in the right direction. I would personally love to see plugins and
themes be brain-dead simple to upgrade or install (useful if you make no
changes to them). I would prefer it not simply notify me of the update but
be able to perform the update as well (perhaps with an "Update Plugin"
button, so I can click on that button at my leisure) when it detects one is
available. It's not how I would implement said feature, but it would still
improve the situation.

It's one of those cultural/individual taste thingies, I guess. Those things
don't annoy me enough to put me off WP, but if I saw them on software I
liked less, they'd be one more reason to avoid it.

I actually agree here. I really don't need a centralised way to  
upgrade plug-ins, I just need them to be able to update without me  
having to go through the check,download,disable,unzip,place,enable.

The normal approach people think here is having a central repository  
and have that be hit. This, to me, is just one of the possible ways.

Another way would be to provide the infrastructure for plugins to  
register themselves to update. the plug-in would just register in the  
updater engine with a list of places to check for new versions. The  
updater engine would then periodically check all the plug-ins sites  
(similar to appcasts for Sparkle in Mac OS X) and let the user know  
of updates.

The update notice sent after the ping would specify the new version,  
changes and other comments, and would internally specify what needs  
to be done and where.

This would take off the burden of a repository, which I think is  
great for human browsing but I just don't see for programatic access.  
I'm not sure if this made any sense, I know I have it clearer in my  
mind, but it's 1am :)

I know of more than one person to whom I have recommended WP who saw the
'Howdy' and dismissed the system without going further thinking it childish.
As Les says - it is perhaps a cultural thing but certainly in the UK it
doesn't work on any level.

"Hi", "Howdy", and "Hello" are all the same to me (English is not my
native language).  Or almost the same.  I guess that for many
non-native speakers, these make as much of a difference as they do to
me (in UK or not). :)

Yes, must be a cultural thing :)
On my club site I had a few complaints (it's a UK site) from club 
members - so changed it to a straight "hello".
Would be easy to make the greeting an option though!

An option would be ridiculous, a filter a possibility, a translation
obviously ;-)

The problem with automatically updating, and not just notifying, is
that it is almost GUARANTEED to not work on a large number of sites,
particularly ones using shared hosting.

What do you do when a host has fsockopen disabled?  What if cURL is
further disabled? What about PHP's FTP capabilities?  What about
permissions?  How do you handle that?

Auto-updating is a GREAT feature, when it works.  My experience is
that it isn't likely to actually work in a good number of situations.

I know it can keep going, for for time purposes, I just went to .9.

If we are going to make it WP3, then I think we should release it later than
Sept. If we're going to jump version numbering, we had might as well make it
a really good release. Drop PHP4, add in the most requested Ideas, make
major performance improvements (such as writing something like WP-Cache,
except in the core, with an option to turn it on in the config), integrate
OpenID support, add themes, add a few plugins (WP.Com Stats for sure), Draft
Management System, make the DB structure better, etc. In my opinion, at
least.

I don't use FF, nor do I like it that much. :P

But, hello, WordPress 1.2->1.5. WordPress 1.5->2.0.

You can do this with the new APIs I believe.

That sounds like a pretty good lineup of what i'd expect for the next  
major version jump.
Except the PHP4 support being droped, I think we all know that the hosts  
arnt likely to upgrade to PHP5 accross the board.
Instead, maybe just bump the current required PHP to 4.3 (given 4.4 is  
out), That'll add a few extra options to developers, and also means that  
hosts can stay with PHP4 if they want, they just need to keep it updated.
(BTW, requirements for WP state PHP 4.2, Wordpress code checks to see if  
its 4.1)

Even better we could put a checkbox, so that every three days 
(configurable) it asks you "Are you still proud of using WordPress?" and 
then updates the templates accordingly, and reports the answer back to a 
web service so we can track the global WP proudness index, but the 
reporting back should probably be an option too because people might 
feel guilty about saying they weren't proud if they knew we would see 
it, it is free.

Something not too dissimilar to that was when Writely Beta wasn't owned
by Google, and they used a "beta meter", where each user had access to a
vote box at the top of each screen, and the question asked was this:

	"Do you think Writely is ready for prime-time yet?"
					Yes / No

And above the message was a meter that showed the ratio of Yes:No
answers. You could change your vote at any time. They said when the
meter reached 100%, they would take Writely out of beta.

However, since being acquired by Google, and being subsequently renamed
to "Google Docs & Spreadsheets", the beta meter is now -poof- vanished.

Making the requirements PHP 5(.2?) will force hosts into being more
up-to-date. It's not like it's hard to run PHP 4 and 5 on the same server.

If we kept PHP4, then we might as well make it PHP 4.4. Although, really,
how much longer is PHP4 still going to be getting new releases?

Even so, that would certainly make WordPress unique in that way. :)

We've had this discussion so many times, the answer is clear,
WordPress won't drop support for PHP4 in the short term. Why? Because
that will be an improvement aimed just to developers, and WordPress is
about users first.

And no, it won't be an "strong message" neither will they switch to
PHP5 just because it is a WordPress requirement.

That doesn't mean that at least in the beginning, a few options could be
provided. Then new ways of downloading can be added later as people start
hacking on it and getting clever. Eventually, the user could be able to
choose the method they prefer that works with their hosting service. If
their hosting service has all the available options disabled, then they
could at least do the downloading and let the core/plugin recognize the
downloaded plugin and begin the install/update. There are many ways for it
to possibly download the file, and it sounds reasonable to offer the choice
to the user.

The plugin could contain the necessary code to to install itself. If
wordpress detects the presence of said plugin (say in
wp-content/plugins/downloads/), then it could unzip the plugin, and read the
installation instruction file and perform any updating/installing that is
necessary by the plugin. If any problems arise, then the site admin can
mitigate them manually.

I've already suggested this before and it received mild attention and there
was supposedly some development for a plugin, but I haven't seem much else
(granted, I haven't gone looking either). With the advent of the center
Plugins page on wordpress.org, I don't see any reason why a feed can't be
added to inform all WP installs of the current plugins and their respective
versions/authors/etc.

You're assuming that nothing is possible because it's difficult.

We're not talking short-term.  2.3 and 2.4 and even 2.5 have that
covered. We're talking 3 and the arguments thus far point to a radical
rewrite -- what better to do than go to PHP5+ as a part of that?

  It's only 4 months away.  I'm not sure we can do enough of a  
radical rewrite in 3 months (remember, last month is locked down for  
bugs) to justify such a huge jump.

There is one nice solution for the "marketing problem" that I keep  
throwing out there every couple months:  WordPress 2008.  Do it like  
a sports video game franchise does it.  For multiple releases within  
a year, we can do WordPress 2007.2 or WordPress 2007b.   This works  
well with our new 4-month cycle.  And people will be made aware of  
exactly how long it has been since they've upgraded.

The problem with skipping numbers is that before you know it, you're  
shipping WordPress 14.5, which just reeks of version inflation.  What  
makes good marketing sense for 2.2-to-3.0 bites you in the ass down  
the road.

My first choice, though is to stick with 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 until  
we're ready to rewrite 50% of the code and really break stuff for a  
groundbreaking, spoon-bending, mind-blowing 3.0 release.

I was hoping to hear back about the possibility of corporate  
sponsorship for that feature (that is, a company using WordPress  
wants the feature, they pay me to develop it, and it makes its way  
into WP core courtesy of the GPL).  That still might be an option,  
but I don't know yet.  If not, it will likely be the big feature that  
I work on for 2.3 on my own time (with help, of course!  I like to  
publicly iterate and get feedback.)

I'm no coder and such, but I'll have to agree with Mark on that. ;) :) 
You already have enough branches besides the trunk, just stick with what 
you got now and steer those big bad boys in their right directions. If 
you keep slapping more on your plates, it's only going to be more 
headaches then what's already here to begin with sigh...

It didn't for me, but I'm on hosted Gmail, maybe different rules.

You guys check your spam folders? Luck you!

I can't afford to do so. I get over 12k spam every 3 to 4 days in that
folder, plus another 50 that make to my inbox. That's what I get for
never using disposable emails, and publishing my email addy in pure HTML
literally everywhere. I don't know what I'd do if it wasn't for Google's
excellent spam filters - then again, I have no idea about the false
positives I'm getting :/

As far as I understand (AFAIU?), Gmail's SPAM filter varies per user,
which kind of makes sense.  On several occasions I saw the same email
being flagged as SPAM for one Gmail user, while delivered to Inbox of
another.  This time is no exception - I got Robin's email just fine,
and some other people found it in their SPAM folders.

I do get a false positive once in a while, but it happens so rarely
that I truly don't care. I'm ready to pay that price for my clean
Inbox.  I am yet to see a SPAM filter half as good as GMail's one.

Yeah, same here.

But Yahoo!'s is probably 49% as good as GMail's... :P

Thanks for your reply but considering the add_submenu is a filepath, this is something mod rewrite would not be effecting..

Any other ideas?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugins : return proper error on activation faliure
Message-ID: <464D5733.2020004@yadan.net>

Some complex plugins may fail during activation (creating database 
tables or what not).

currently there is no way for plugins to return an error signal + error 
message in such cases: only thing they can do is to print the error.

this is problematic as the error does not fit well into the wordpress 
admin page, and can also cause problems if for some reason the someone 
tries to set an http header after the plugin was activated.


I suggest that we allow plugin to return error message back to wordpress 
on activation.

personally I feel a jump from a point release to a whole number release is when a insignificant percentage of the base (core) code base changes..

Without that, it is just another point release..

It doesn't have to be code. A new default theme wouldn't be a bad excuse
for a major version bump.

Like right now for my most popular program (EasyBCD) I've been on 1.x
for a while. When I bump up to 2.0, the only code change I'll be doing
is adding localization support and shipping it with 5 or 6 languages.
It's drastically different from the _1.0_ release (major should be
compared with major, IMO), and between 1.0 and 2.0 I've addressed all
the issues that ever existed and enhanced it all I think I could.

Changes between minor releases may not be that great, but I don't think
it's fair to decide on a major bump depending on whether or not it's too
big of a change for a minor - you should compare your progress since the
last major version, and see where you stand.

So the real question is:

Has WordPress changed significantly from 2.0 to be considered WordPress 3?

NOT
Has WordPress changed significantly since 2.2 or 2.3 to be considered
WordPress 3.

Gentoo and Ubuntu have been doing that for a while and, well, I don't
like it.  I'd have a hard time putting a finger on it, but it just
seems, well, weird.  While the releases tied to a year (or, as in
Madden's case, tied to the NEXT year) make sense for a product
released once-yearly, it somehow just comes off as a bit geeky for
twice- or thrice-yearly.  (Feisty Fawn being 2007.4, for instance.)

The nice thing about a release numbering scheme not tied to chronology
is that it leaves you free to indicate to users the relative "weight"
you give a release.  Since we've been talking about what would
constitute a 2.x->3 jump, I think we're keyed in on this notion fairly
well.

People have been using X.Y numbering schemes since almost the
beginning of computer science and there's a certain expectation built
into that at this point.  People look at a 3.0 product and figure
"Hey, must be some big changes from 2.x" whereas there's no way to
evoke that reaction when they say "Well, 2006.10 was okay, but 2007.4
is where it's REALLY at!"

Hope I'm making some modicum of sense -- it's early and I've not yet
had any caffeine.

I absolutely agree with every single word! I also don't like year-based
versioning, for the same reasons.

For example, when there are big changes during one year, those versions
would be 2007.0 to 2007.23 while the first bugfix in 2008 would be
2008.0 -- that doesn't make sense.

And just imagine Linus would release kernels like 2001.6.20.4... ;)

Agreed 100%. Winamp 5 has been around for four years -- not because
there hasn't been any significant development, but the base platform
has been the same, backwards compatibility has been maintained, etc.,
etc... I don't see version inflation as a positive thing.

Message-ID: <C2736CE7.4BCD%andy@yellowswordfish.com>

Hi all
I have one user of one of my plugins - (amongst hundreds without this
problem) - who can activate the plugin successfully but gets no menu item
appearing. (Both Firefox and IE - permissions fine/cache emptied - logged in
as admin etc).
The only possible difference (which I personally think is probably
irrelevant) is that this is a user who has just installed WP 2.2 - i.e., a
completely new site - and then tried to install my plugin.
Can anyone advise on what I should be getting him to look at or do I just
tell him to go to the WP forums...
Thanks for any advice,
Andy

( A terrific discussion and lots of good points snipped for brevity. )

It's true that what you people are saying is the golden standard.
However, we can't exactly mandate what the universe of hosting
providers hands us. What we can do work with what we get. Dropping PHP4
support is a disservice just like providing only PHP4 support.

What about a wrapper around your PHP5 only code;

if ( php_version() < 5 ) {
  print "whoops, you need php 5 for this...";
  mail ( "support folks", "php 5 request", "this domain, ",
$_SERVER['HOST_NAME']." needs PHP5 for this file: ".__FILE__." can we
please get an upgrade here?" );
}
else {

// run your php5 stuff
}



In this case, we can stick php5 code into the core, and still support
php4 people. It'd require some more work to write whatever needs to
happen in the first clause, but I think if we're committed to user
support we should consider it.

While I would love to see PHP5 only, the truth is it's not happening  
anytime soon. What I don't like about this option is that you're  
creating two sets of code to do the same thing. That's all wrappers  
are. If we're going to create PHP4 code that accomplishes the same  
thing as PHP5, we might as well just skip the PHP5 and write the  
PHP4. My concern here is merely around bloat, y'know?

What is in the Number or the Name, if there is no significant improvement in
basic software, db, loading time, ajax enhancement etc.

The plugin section should be changed similar to Gallery 2 style, where one
can search, download, update, install, and configure right from the plugin
page. Further there is much to be done, in the various section of the
wordpress, before one can think about calling it wordpress 3.

I completely agree with Doug on this one.  With Microsoft, I always feel
like I'm behind, and it's not a good feeling.  Great for marketing, but it
may make the user feel strange when they are using a perfectly valid WP 2007
and it's now 2008.

Gentoo and Ubuntu have been doing that for a while and, well, I don't like
it.  I'd have a hard time putting a finger on it, but it just seems, well,
weird.  While the releases tied to a year (or, as in Madden's case, tied to
the NEXT year) make sense for a product released once-yearly, it somehow
just comes off as a bit geeky for
twice- or thrice-yearly.  (Feisty Fawn being 2007.4, for instance.)

The nice thing about a release numbering scheme not tied to chronology is
that it leaves you free to indicate to users the relative "weight" you give
a release.  Since we've been talking about what would constitute a 2.x->3
jump, I think we're keyed in on this notion fairly well.

People have been using X.Y numbering schemes since almost the beginning of
computer science and there's a certain expectation built into that at this
point.  People look at a 3.0 product and figure "Hey, must be some big
changes from 2.x" whereas there's no way to evoke that reaction when they
say "Well, 2006.10 was okay, but 2007.4 is where it's REALLY at!"

Hope I'm making some modicum of sense -- it's early and I've not yet had any
caffeine.

Message-ID: <eab7f3140705180742m10629965l615ee90ee3195df5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am wondering what people think about the attached patch.

Essentially it adds a single option posts_per_archive_page which
provides a separate limit for the number of posts that should be
displayed on archive and category pages. Separate to the
posts_per_page which, currently, limits the number of posts displayed
on any page. This can also be achieved with the Custom Query Search
plugin, however CQS is no longer actively supported, so I suggest this
option be added to Wordpress.

Thoughts?

Patch will apply against current trunk.

Andrew

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible bug with endpoints
Message-ID: <C2733E59.2F98%leahy@au.org>

I think I have found a bug with rewrite endpoints, but I would like for
someone with more experience and knowledge to check it out since I am a
newbie at hacking WordPress.

When a rewrite endpoint is found, the query_var value for it is set to an
empty string which happens to also be what wp_query->get() returns for a
non-existent query_var.



(/wp-include/query.php) WP_query->get():
 494      function get($query_var) {
 495          if (isset($this->query_vars[$query_var])) {
 496              return $this->query_vars[$query_var];
 497          }
 498  
 499          return '';
 500      }




This next snippet of code is what I think is setting the endpoint value to
an empty string:



(/wp-include/rewrite.php) inside the function generate_rewrite_rules():
//build up an array of endpoint regexes to append => queries to append
if ($endpoints) {
    $ep_query_append = array ();
    foreach ($this->endpoints as $endpoint) {
       //match everything after the endpoint name, but allow for [...]
       $epmatch = $endpoint[1] . '(/(.*))?/?$';
      //this will be appended on to the rest of the query for each dir
      $epquery = '&' . $endpoint[1] . '=';
      $ep_query_append[$epmatch] = array ( $endpoint[0], $epquery );
    }
}

To get my tests to work, I changed the following line of:
    $epquery = '&' . $endpoint[1] . '=';
to:
    $epquery = '&' . $endpoint[1] . '='.$endpoint[1];





I created a test plugin and I did the testing with WP 2.2.
The plugin:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Test Endpoint
Plugin URI:
Description: 
Version: 1.0
Author: Seamus Leahy
*/
function TestEndpoint(){
    add_action('init', 'TestEndpointInit');
     add_action('template_redirect', 'TestEndpointRedirect');
}

function TestEndpointInit(){
    global $wp_rewrite;
    $wp_rewrite->add_endpoint("testendpoint", EP_ALL);
     $wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}

function TestEndpointRedirect(){
    $my_var = get_query_var('testendpoint');

    if (empty($my_var)){
         return;
     }
    
    die( '<h1>We hit the endpoint: testendpoint!</h1>');

}

TestEndpoint();

?>
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The test:
  1. Install the plugin and activate it
  2. Go to an existing page, append to the URL "/testendpoint/", and go to
the new URL
     - Expected results: " We hit the endpoint: testendpoint!"
     - Actually results: The original page without the endpoint
  3. Change the file /wp_include/rewrite.php as stated above
  4. Repeat step 2
      - Actually results:  " We hit the endpoint: testendpoint!"

You can't do this now? I don't run windows, and I haven't been able to
get Ecto to run under Wine (yet), so I don't know how/if Ecto handles
flagging drafts. But there's support for it in the XML-RPC APIs
(metaWeblog/MT).

"Dropping support?"  Nobody's planning on turning off all previous releases
of WordPress, right?  Nobody's suggesting that critical fixes wouldn't
continue to be made to the last PHP4-compatible release, right?

If WordPress is a "Friend of PHP" and we're still waffling on supporting a
3-year-old version, I'm starting to think we're all going to need to learn
Ruby soon.

Seamus --

I may be wrong, but I don't think you can change the endpoint code as 
you are suggesting, because I think it will break the use of endpoints 
of this form:

     existingurl/testendpoint/val/

Endpoints of this form work with the existing rewrite code, and tell 
it to set up q['testendpoint'] = 'val' in the query vars. This is used 
for things like tags, language switching, etc., and appears to be what 
the endpoint code was set up to do, rather than just having

     existingurl/testendpoint/

with no trailing value, as you are trying to do.

By the way, did you try isset instead of empty, in your redirect 
function? It is possible that that will fix your issue, but i am not 
sure without testing it (or reading the query parsing code more than I 
have time to do at the moment).

Hope this helps clarify --
     Jennifer

I had made a fairly strong post on this topic earlier. I am really
suggesting just dropping hints to the community that php5 is the way to
go, and wordpress is going to go that way eventually. Besides, as
Charles points out, WP can have a dead branch to support php4 in the
future for all those content to use the obsolete release, just like the
php community does. No doubt wp will be supporting php4 for a long time
to come. Suggesting now that we want to start embracing the love and
goodness of php5 is just progress. The php development community would
consider it a validation of their efforts. 
Once developers get into making the changes to do stuff on php5, they
will find that its not that big of a deal, and besides there are
benefits.

Just keep dropping hints about it. This issue is not going to go away. 


Cheers,
PG

Let's do this: let's document what NOT having PHP5 as a requirement
restrains us from implementing.

SimpleXML stuff comes readily to mind.  What else?

You may very well be correct there. I went off for on the little
documentation I found
<http://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse/WP_Rewrite_API#add_endpoint.28.2
9>:

    add_endpoint()
    Add a new endpoint like /trackback/

Also, if I try existingurl/testendpoint/fooval/, I cannot find any reference
to testendpoint or fooval when doing a var_dump of $wp_query with the
original code.  I assume that those values would exist in $wp_query (I could
wrong).

When I try using isset(), it always returns true because
get_query_var/$wp_query->get will return an empty string instead of null if
nothing is found.

The second one's not a bug, but I take your point in re: PHP5 and bugs.

Are you saying, though, that there is no utility to moving to PHP5?
Is WP consigned to using increasingly decrepit code?  I don't know how
to interpret your posting of a few bugs in this discussion. Are there
not bugs and annoyances with 4 that have been worked around countless
times before?

I believe he's saying that at this point, the benefits don't outweigh  
the bugs.

Forcing users, at this point in time, to use PHP5 for a Wordpress  
install would alienate a large portion of our user group, and provide  
only nominal new features and gains, while it also brings with it a  
host of bugs. Yes, there are bugs, etc. that have been worked around  
in PHP4, but that's exactly the point: they've already been worked  
around. If we moved to PHP 5 now, we'd lose users and have a whole  
new host of bugs to work around, while gaining minor convenience.

That is all...

It's a back-compat problem that busted lots of apps.

"And some of the reasons why hosts stay on 4."

I'm saying these bugs are reasons more hosts don't bother with php5.
Almost every php5 dot release has broken WP and other projects.  I
can't remember the last time a php4 dot release broke anything.
Further, its usually "bogus" bugs that cause the most pain.  PHP5
changes the shutdown sequence, breaks everyone, and says this is the
new way, deal with it.

Interfaces - great for plugin API stuff.
Classes with __get and __set, potential for nice theme work.
Phar - may also have great plugin potential
Streams support, has great potential in a few areas such as the
templating engine, which would be a nice place to be able to fiddle
with streams when including and requiring.
Filter. Everyone knows we could probably use it.
PDO + bound parameters, no more SQL injection
DateTime. Proper timezone support.
JSON. Native C class.
headers_list(), really needed to finish implementing WP-Cache properly.
php_check_syntax(), properly implement the plugins avoiding fatal errors code.
Zip. Also has potential for plugins and themes.

I can think of more if necessary.

...But we're not talking about THIS point in time.  2.3, 2.4 and 2.5
have been spec'd for release already.  We're talking about the future
development direction (or, at least, we were on that WP 3.0 thread).
I'm fine with stability and not pissing off the user community right
now, but I think there are a lot of great reasons to look to PHP5+ (as
Robert's post demonstrates).  There's a lot of wickedly-cool stuff
that not having 5 around restrains us from doing.

The other end of the spectrum is Java where the language is being held back
from providing clear improvements, and the JRE becomes even more bloated, by
the need for "backward compatibility" at all costs, even on long-deprecated
APIs.

But now that Java is GPL'd, we'll be able to take the bloat out and
make Java the reigning king of languages, capable of crushing all
comers!

Then, the magic unicorn of the Metaverse will come down and sprinkle
us all with fairy dust and we'll be able to fly to the moon and...

Dreamhost offers both, with 5.2.1 (soon to be .2) being the default
when you go to register a new (sub)domain.

I absolutely love the concept, just a week ago I was starting some  
research on which hosts offer PHP 5 to decide if I wanted to make the  
switch in my own applications.

A central, wiki-based repository would be perfect for this-- what  
would be better is if it could include not only hosts that support it  
by default, but instructions to turn it on for hosts that require a  
little "coaxing."

"usephp5.org" is available, and I have a dedicated server with some  
extra space. Hosting costs could be supplemented by donations. I'd be  
happy to kickstart the project/register the domain, if anyone else is  
interested. :)

Forcing?  You mean because PHP5 is so horrible and buggy and offers no
benefits over PHP 4?  And because we've embedded a worm into 2.x releases
that makes 2.x installs delete themselves when a PHP 5-dependent release of
WP is introduced.  I have to say, that IS pretty evil...

> If we moved to PHP 5 now, we'd lose users...

Definitely.  Thousands of stuck-with-PHP4 users will immediately abandon WP
2.x because they can't upgrade to WP 3 on the day it's released.

Plus, we can keep the whole WP3-will-require-PHP5 thing a secret so that
that hosts won't have 6+ months to prepare.  Along with not giving hosts a
heads-up, we'll also let them know that it's ABSOULTELY NOT POSSIBLE to
create a special page listing WP3-friendly hosts, so that the few stragglers
will have no marketing-related motivation to be ready.

Now that I think about it, is there anything in WordPress that couldn't be
back-ported to PHP3?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Minor WP::build_query_string() refactor
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0705181628420.11183@miranda.org>

Here is a minor patch to make the WP::build_query_string() method
slightly more clear, efficient, and correct. (As best I can tell.)

http://www.trachtenberg.com/patches/wp-classes-bqs.txt

I didn't see any specific tests for this method, but I get the same
results with my version using the following sample test data:

$wp = new wp;
$wp->query_vars = array('a' => 'a', 'b' => array(), 'c' => '', 'd' => 'd d');
$wp->build_query_string();
print_r($wp->query_string);

The only difference is WP will no longer generate consecutive "&"
characters when presented with a non-scalar value. I think this is
better behavior than before, and should not break anything.

Please let me know if there is a specific reason for the various hoop
jumping in the method (I did not do a full review to check inputs and
outputs), or if there is a preferred method of submitting patches
beyond sending them to this list.

-adam

PS: This is against 2.2.

I've not come to an email that says this yet, so sorry if it is a
repeat, but 2.10 comes after 2.9 unless the cumulative changes with the
next version are enough to warrant (and marketing can come into that
vaulation) a full release.  Otherwise, versioning is senseless IMHO.

This is an invitation to spam, and not all that useful. The list is 
possibly infinite -- hopefully at some point will include every single 
host in the world within a year or two. I would propose taking this page 
down.

The best thing to convince hosts to change would be requests from their 
paying customers.

The problem as I understand it is you can post an entry as "draft"  
status, but there's no way in reading entries back from the server to  
get the draft entries for further editing.  It's a one-way mechanism  
in the MT API.

I'm hoping this will be rectified in the APP interface to WordPress,  
but maybe it will also one day be rectified in the XMLRPC interface,  
as well?

Presumably it'd also be a central place to collect notes specific to
installing/using WordPress on a particular host, which as far as I know
doesn't exist.

Ah. You also need to add testendpoint to the list of known query 
variables. Try the query_vars action.

I'm not sure about 50% of the code rewritten milestone, but I'm in this
camp too.  If it was decided that protecting WordPress with nonces
wasn't important enough to the community to bump the version, I don't
think bumping the version for less substatial reasons is a good idea.

Since we are throwing out ideas, one obvious thing that I'd like to see
in a 3.0 release is a MySQL 5 requirement.  MySQL 5 has some substantial
benefits and planning for it early might allow to design features with
that in mind.  What could we do with bit fields and a stored procedure
that allows us to use them as bit masks?  What new features could adding
triggers to the database give us?  

Knowing things like that are going to be available should help the
design process.  Heck, now that 2.2 is out, 4.1's subqueries alone
should make some problems a lot easier to solve.

You know that if we can't get PHP5 support when PHP5 has been around much longer, we have absolutely zero chance of getting Mysql 5 in there :)

100,000+ domains seems like a totally reasonable requirement.  It wouldn't
necessarily need to be on a wiki, giving you control over what appears
there.

php_check_syntax() is a really cool idea. Too bad it's deprecated already.

Not to get off-topic, but it makes you wonder, why would they  
deprecate such a seemingly awesome function, without offering any  
apparent means of a replacement?

Command line equivalent is `php -l filename.php`... wonder how  
inelegant it would be to implement a replacement? (Probably very :P).

Actually I like the 3.0 tag for dropping php4 support.. We got to draw the line for php 4.x support sometime, a major bump to 3.0 is a great way to do this.

Wow more than depreciated, depreciated AND removed...

"Note: For technical reasons, this function is deprecated and removed
from PHP. Instead, use php -l somefile.php from the commandline."

I wonder if it was somehow security related...

It all depends upon when 3.0 comes out.  For me, there are more reasons
to upgrade from MySQL 4 to MySQL 5 than there are from php4 to php5.  So
there's no reason to assume the adoption rate is identical.

Release dates:
PHP 5 released 7/2004. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
MySQL 5 released 8/2005.
(http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/news/article_976.html)

If we are talking about the third release from now, after 2.3 & 2.4,
that's one whole year away.  MySQL 5 then should be available at most
hosts by then.

I assume you mean the wp.methods in xmlrpc.php? Or am I missing  
something else?

I can't find anything in the xmlrpc.php file that alludes to an  
ability to fetch drafts from the server.

You can fetch them if you already know they exist (by their ID).

Ah - I see! Interesting caveat. Thanks for this pointer, it might be  
enough for me to get the desired support into MarsEdit.

Hosts are also about users first (well, sometimes money, but users and money
tie into each other), so when people start emailing support saying that WP3
is out and it needs PHP5, hosts aren't going to sit their and lose
customers, they're going to install PHP5.

Year based versioning really only works for bigger, better know companies
who release a new version every year or every few years. You barley ever
heard Office 12, but you do hear Office 2007.

I agree. If you look at some programs, they're at like v15 and they still
suck. I think we should stick to the +0.1 versioning for now, and consider
WP3 when we're ready to make MAJOR changes.

We could always take what's in the trunk right now, put it in a branch
called 2.3 and then take the trunk and make it WP3. So we could slowing
start working on WP3, but still have our main focus as 2.3.

I agree.

Commercial products gets major releases whenever the companies want their 
customers to pay once more for their software, and by making that possible 
they need to supply a product that different from the previous version so 
that their customers are willing to pay for it.

It is almost the same with open source software, a new major release should be 
compelling enough that users are willing to make the step (suffering?) to 
start using the new version, not by paying, but by doing the upgrades and 
changes to meet the requirements.

Yes, we need to start now if we are going to make it, because it is not enough 
time in a normal release cycle.

If we start now by planning the design and dependencies of third party 
software it is possible to have WP 3.0 in about a year, and still maintaining 
WP 2.x with bugfixes (and probably adding tagging support).

That's nonsense, Matt.

I'd venture a guess and say that WordPress is "bigger and more well
known" than Gentoo & co. - and WordPress definitely releases more often.

While I agree that WP shouldn't be year-versioned, I disagree with your
reasons. I don't hear of OpenOffice 2008 nor Firefox 2002.

I know, precisely because I requested this of eleven2 (the hosting I  
use), that some of them don't plan to switch until most major  
packages support PHP5. It's a kind of catch-22. Although I understand  
the reticence of developers to support a minoritary platform this in  
turn sends the signal that php5 is not good enough to warrant a  
switch. Since implementing it would mean lots of support requests  
(many more than currently exist for not offering it) hosting  
solutions don't really have the incentive to do it.

Aah, the joys of backwards compatibility. Provide it and you can't  
evolve as readily. Don't provide it and you risk alienating your  
customers/users.

Hosts with many less domains than this have implemented Fantastico,  
that for some it's good enough. I personally have found enough  
trouble with permissions when mixing automated solutions with user- 
installed ones that I truly don't know what advice to give.

I would implement "Instant Update" in the core, though, at the very  
least. This would mean that users would rely on Fantastico only for  
the first installation. It wouldn't mangle their user-owned  
modifications later on when upgrading.

Something like suPHP's functionality would't be amiss, either.

Sandboxing will be in PHP6 if there's a "rock solid" implementation,  
meaning it may well have been security reasons why it was removed.

Most hosts have real reasons for not running PHP5, varying from bugs,  
to security holes (there are some security holes in PHP5 that the  
devs refuse to accept exist).

Sorry - we've been doing some further hunting but haven't turned up a
solution as yet. The plugin is 'Simple Forum'. The line of code for the
admin menu uses a pretty standard call:

add_submenu_page('edit.php', __('Simple Forum', 'sforum'), __('Simple
Forum', 'sforum'), 8, 'simple-forum/sf-admin.php');

No function - just runs the script.

There is more however. We have now discovered that the 'activate' hook
didn't run either as the necessary new tables have not been created and nor
have the options been setup. So that's two hooks that are not being
actioned. There are a lot of users of this and this is a unique problem to
date.

I'm really just looking for any ideas that we can try to get him up and
running. Anything he or I should check.

Thanks

This uses old user levels instead of a cap. Most likely the reason the
menu doesn't show.

You need to paste code for that too. The way you say the 'activate'
hook (quoted) makes me think you actually tried to use a hook called
activate, which we don't call. You need to register your plugin's
activation hook with register_activation_hook().

Semi-off-topic, but since the consensus is that the best way to get  
hosts to move to PHP 5 is user advocacy, I made up a quick modified  
version of the PHP logo that people might be interested in using to  
link to the WordPress list (as long as it survives).

You should keep in mind that, even though PHP is OpenSource, they do
have a trademark policy, and they don't like people messing around with
their trademark. I don't think it's a good idea to distribute modified
versions of the PHP logo, regardless of the upgrading question.

Well, all the same, it actually works for everyone except one user from
WP2.0 right up to 2.2. It also tallies with the examples in  the codex
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus) and after checking
other plugins I am using here they also use this format. Mark J's 'Subscribe
to comments' for example  - OK it uses the 'add_management_page' wrapper but
still uses a level 8. So should the role be substituted now? As in the
string -  'Administrator'?

The same applies to the activation - no problems anywhere else. I used:

add_action('activate_simple-forum/sf-control.php', 'sf_setup_data');

And again this is straight out the codex
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Tables_with_Plugins) and has worked
flawlessly up until this particular install.

I am more than  happy to change both of these if it resolves that users
problems who really wants to use this plugin but it would be nice to know
why, if something has changed, it is suddenly kicking in now.

As always, help and guidance apreciated.

I was at Microsoft when we decided to change from versions to years: with Windows 95.  The decision was done because:

1) It sounded modern, cool, hip.  There were lots of people who then said "so Windows 01 will sound ancient?".  But the marketing people didn't care, they wanted the cool "95".  The jokes inside soon became: "so that's a percent complete, right?"

2) It implied a release every year, which was just fine with the sales folks, and the dev folks thought they actually could plan and release an OS release on that kind of schedule (major, minor, minor, major, minor...).  I think Vista shows the folly of that argument.

3) It would make people want to upgrade: "holy cow, you're still running that ancient '98 version?  But it's 2001!".  It's easy to see running "Windows" forever, but Windows '95 sounds ancient -- you better upgrade.  The problem with that is, if it's 2006 and the only product the company has to sell is Office 2003, the company looks stupid, not the customer.

You can see that desktop Windows abandoned years with Windows 2000 (now XP or Vista), the server people still call it by years (Windows Server 2007, Exchange 2003, etc.), and the Office and other product people love it.

I think WP shouldn't do years for a couple of reasons: 1) WP doesn't have anywhere near the same kind of marketing pressure that Microsoft has, and 2) more importantly, WP actually *can* and *does* release more than one product a year.

Yes, but "bigger, better known companies" don't release as often you see.
So, yearly based versioning works for them. WP releases new versions a
couple times a year (or know, it is), so we'd end up with something like WP
2007.2.1.

Yearly versioning works great for Anti-Virus software, because then they can
sell their software to the same customers, even if barley anything has
changed. Do we want that to happen with WP? No.

How about WordPress 7.05? ;-)

Version /numbers/ can contain valuable (and compressed) information.

Codenames assist indexing and identification of information. They are
also more memorable and make communication easier. But WordPress has
had these for many years... just a shame people prefer to name WP
versions by the numbers.

You mean the Jazz names? Ella, et. al?

I think no one even knows them. Look at Ubuntu - they don't ever
publicly call Feisty Fawn "Ubuntu 7.04," so that's what the customers
call it.

If WordPress 2.2 headlines said: "WordPress Zippy Zebra Released" that's
what people would call it. But they read the headlines, it says:

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
"WordPress 2.2 Released!"

something something lorem epsum something something
yadadadyadyadda
aounouonuo
r,.diri
oexba
',.p
aoeuoeauaouaouoeuaeouaeou
BTW, WordPress 2.2 is codename "Zippy Zebra"
aoeuoauoauaouaou
ricroaid
khtkbaot.

oaeirr.

Go download WordPress 2.2

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


No wonder people call it WordPress 2.2 or WP22 for short :P

(And, yes, I do use DVORAK.. See how beautiful all those clustered
vowels look? :P)

(And WTF is wrong with GnuPG? "Problem with Agent" even when I try it

Of course you can have a switch to PHP5 right now. Just sign below:

"I am willing to provide at least 15 hours daily support for bazillions
of astonished WordPress users, who just installed WordPress or upgraded
their WP installations and now encounter unexplainable  error messages,
on the WP forums and hosting providers' hotlines. Furthermore, I am
willing to rewrite all other applications that are installed on the same
servers as the new WP version and PHP4 only, even though it is not my
fault that the respective developers didn't make them PHP5-proof."

Just curious, but what's exactly wrong with calling it WP 2.2 or just 2.2?

When saving a post (with say metaWeblog.newPost  or editPost) you can  
indicate that it is a draft.  You are correct though, we don't have  
any specific methods for managing those drafts.  Seems reasonable to  
add that under the new wp.* methods.  Did you have something in mind  
already?

If you have been having other issues with WordPress XML-RPC please  
let me know, I'd be happy to help track them down.

SimpleXML is just an API. There are others that work in PHP 4. Any 
actual feature you can implement with SimpleXML in PHP 5 can be 
implemented in other ways in PHP 4.

Or are you really asking what not haveing PHP5 as a requirement keeps us 
from *using*?

I don't think it is so much, can we do it better more along the lines of why continue to develop for what is a dead version, maintained purely for security patches only.

It is really time to move on, it is not like we are breaking new ground here, plenty of other high profile open source projects have moved to php 5 only releases.

Thanks, Joseph. It's nice to hear ;)

I don't have anything in mind but I will probably have a better sense  
after I play with what the other systems provide for inspecting drafts.

At first guess I'd think maybe something similar to "getRecentPosts"  
but specifically for drafts would be a good start.

As a _user_ of such systems, I'd have to say that's a bloody important
feature we're missing out on.

I switch clients a lot. Call it insecurity, but I constantly switch to
and from BloGTK, Live Writer, and BlogJet (no Mac, sorry :P). I'd love
to have a way for them all to share the same drafts, instead each is
limited to the drafts it created.

This is a security update to the 2.0 branch, with testable fixes  
going into importers, the custom color header in Kubrick (default

WordPress already works with PHP5.  It's no harder to install or use WP with
PHP5.

(Is anyone here even running WP on PHP4, except for development/testing
purposes?)

Even the most mass-market hosts in the world support both.

Aren't you both talking about the wrong thing and really he just needs
to replace the 8 for the userlevel in the arg list with
'manage_options'? Yes.

The current_user_can check needs to go in the page itself.

A small request.. the Reset Password procedure needs to be made clearer 
by revising the login.php screens.

Some of the subscribers to my site have not found the "Lost Password" 
procedure easy.
Reasons appear to be:
1) When they receive the email saying "

Someone has asked to reset the password for the following site and username.
Username: member
To reset your password visit the following address, otherwise just ignore this email and nothing will happen.
http://www.mysite/wp-login.php?action=rp&key=0831b1a1"


They think this is a new password..
They click the reset link, this impression is reinforced when they see 
the login.php screen with Username/password/submit - which implies (to 
them) they should enter something, but they don't know what! (They don't 
always notice the yellow text at the top asking them to check email 
/again/! )

I suggest a simple improvement - that the confirmation and check email 
screens should hide the edits and submit buttons - then they user will 
actually read the text lines, and the whole thing will give less room 
for confusion.

Oh, finally - if they click the reset link a second time, the message is 
something like

"this code appears invalid" 

- this is not helpful to a user - perhaps we could say:

"have you used the email link before?
It can only be used once, please request another Password Reset to start again"

thanks

majority of WP users. They actually know to use PHP5. :P

And, I reiterate:

If we're going by stated timelines for WP dev cycles, the changes we
are proposing are at least 1 year off (given 4 month cycles for 2.3,.4
& .5).  We're not talking about tomorrow.

Might I suggest that the PHP5 conversation does not have any traction
right now.  

As with ANY requirement, it won't happen until there is tangible
benefit.  If there are WordPress features that, by their very nature,
require or benefit from PHP 5, they should be added to trac as such so
that they don't get lost.  That will build the case for PHP 5.  Right
now, I would be shocked if this part of the thread ended in a definate:
PHP 5 WILL or WILL NOT be in WordPress 3

Heck, I'd be surprised if it ended at all!

Sorry, in an attempt to clarify, you're saying that (1) users need to know PHP to use WordPress, and (2) PHP5 is harder to use than PHP4?  Neither of those ring true to me.

I think it's time to lose the fear of PHP5, especially given the 2008 timeframe.  I'm guessing that the vast majority of us have been running WP under PHP5 for quite some time, and it obviously works great.  Most hosts support PHP5 now, and if we decide that WordPress 3 will require it, the rest will have a comfortable year to follow.

Let's stop waffling and go with PHP5 for WordPress 3.  It's good for WordPress, good for PHP (which we all presumably want to see advance and thrive), and we'll take steps to make sure it's as good as PHP4 for users.

No, that is not even close to what he said. He said that the people on
this list know to use PHP5. Not that they know _how_ to use PHP5. I
believe that answers both of your questions.

No, you haven not been following the thread at all. Most hosts do not
support PHP5. In fact, the vast majority don't even come close. Its
easy to name 5 big well-known hosts that support PHP5, but name a
bunch of small ones. I guarantee that its easier to find a list of
1000 smaller hosts that don't than it is to find 1000 smaller hosts
that do. As was pointed out earlier, cPanel still doesn't support
PHP5, this is a major hindrance to its adoption, as there are
countless hosts using cPanel.

I'm forking this PHP5 discussion to a new thread.

There's no question that PHP5 will "be in" WordPress 3.  The only question
is whether it's a requirement, which is not that difficult a question.

We can punt on the issue, of course.  That's the open source stereotype that
proprietary software vendors /love/, after all -- that open source projects
meander on, with no concrete plans and nobody to make the most important
decisions, making them difficult or impossible to plan around, blah blah
blah.

Lots of people depend on WP.  If WP doesn't require PHP5 -- a 4-year-old
release by the time WP3 will be introduced, for goodness' sake -- it makes a
strong point that PHP is a dying language.  I think the "fear of five" has
to end.

P.S.  PHP6 is coming in 2008, right?

To be quite honest, I'm really rather frustrated with much of the BS
that's been flying around this mailing list for the past couple days,
from the proponents and opponents of adopting PHP5 for some magical
future version. Its also frustrating having to read people repeating
stupid comments because they haven't read the thread or just flat out
don't know what the hell they're going on about. Let's get a few facts
straight.

1. PHP5 is not more widespread than PHP5. Perhaps it is today on the
larger hosts, Site5, Godaddy, Dreamhost, ASO, MediaTemple, [insert
your favourite buzzy host here], but at the same time, the thousands
upon thousands of smaller hosts out there, relying on nothing but
cPanel/WHM for their server management, are stuck on PHP4. The smaller
hosts vastly outnumber the large hosts that everyone can quickly name
with PHP5 support. Face the facts, PHP4 is still far more common.
Here's a nice graph for PHP's version distribution as of April 2007.
http://www.nexen.net/images/stories/phpversion/200704/versions.en.png

2. There are advantages to switching, and it is holding developers
back on features that they might want to implement. Does this mean we
should switch immediately? No, but there are certainly features of
PHP5 that we could use and hindrances of PHP4 that we could lose
(rhyming not intended).

3. It is too early to tell. WordPress has been having issues even
locking down a 4 month development cycle, and yet people are trying to
predict 1 year into the future? We don't know where PHP will be then,
we don't know where WordPress will be then, and we don't even know
that there will be a version 3 by then. Let's take things as they
come, we're getting ahead of ourselves with even having this
discussion.

With those things in mind, right now, despite being one of the people
who has always actively promoted PHP5 and the only one to even post a
list of reasons to move to PHP5 on the list so far, I say that we are
not ready to make a decision on when we should drop support for PHP4.
Keep it for now, bring this discussion back up later once PHP5 has _at
least_ a majority marketshare, or a killdate for PHP4 support has been
announced by the PHP team, and we'll be more prepared to answer the
question.

Sounds reasonable.  I want to look at exactly how the current methods  
interact with drafts and then potentially move forward with draft  
specific methods.

Thanks for the correction.  But I'll go out on a limb and say that there's almost nobody doing their own install of WP that doesn't know what version of PHP they're running.

You haven't been following the thread at all.   :O)   We're talking about WP3, the release of which is not imminent.

I agree with all the statements you made. I've been out of the 
discussion since I don't know much about the specs on how many people 
use it and such.

All that the devs and everyone else in the community should be thinking 
about now is the next release. Not releases down the road. You can waste 
your time discussing features you want way down the line, but it's just 
wasting the time of the developers when you already got a short window 
to deal with for the current release.

Even after a "killdate" has been set for PHP4, I don't think that WP 
should be changed right when it's announced. It will probably take at 
least a year after support is dropped for everything to switch over. 
Hell, WP still supported MySQL 3 for a long time. I know it has recently 
be dropped, but it shows that you should always keep backwards 
compatibility (and how long you have to keep it for) to keep people that 
get left in the dust, happy.

I know that this is probably just extra fluff to this discussion, but it 
might as well end here at least until we get some room to breath (After 
2.2.x has stabilized and no more features are being added).

Oh, good grief... If I wasn't talking about a "PHP5 requirement" what
the heck would I have been talking about?!?!  It's been the subject of
this whole rambling branch of the thread for the last two days.  And
while it may not be a difficult question in your opinion, it is fairly
plain that there isn't a clear consensus. 

I'm sure the subject will come up again closer to the time of the wp3
release.

Honestly, I had no idea.  I've never heard anyone talk about PHP "being in"
WP.   :^)   Apologies for the offense.

Agreed, and if there's no leadership on the issue, we'll be supporting three
releases of PHP in 2008.

No, and I doubt anybody does. On the same hand, if you read my post,
there was a graph of the version distribution of PHP over a wide range
of servers, and WordPress is installed just about everywhere.

Afaik, you still have to plug the sources in by hand, but then again,
cPanel's documentation has no mention either way. Even if it does, I
know for a fact its not the default.

I'm with Brian. I have yet to be convinced that moving to PHP 5 is feasible,
considering the current hosting situation. Personally, I could code without
PHP 5's features, but I would much rather do with. The way I see it, all
we've managed in this thread is to reiterate the same points over and over
again.

I suggest that is time to drop this discussion for good, it is clear that
wordpres won't make the version jump just now, and is good that the main
developers took that position.

Besides, it have became useless and time consuming, nobody reads the whole
thread and most of the messages are based on personal experiences/desires so
there is no real value in most of them, I'm personally sick of reading the
same arguments that have been presented before with their respective
counter-arguments again.

We should turn focus on the next release, features, bugs and enhancements,
if you really need/want to further discuss why php5 is better/worse than
php4, please do it in the php lists.(http://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php)

Not a single person has talked about doing this just now.  It's my turn to rant about people not paying attention.   :^)

> ...if you really need/want to further discuss why php5 is better/
> worse than php4...

You're thinking of it as a religious issue, and that's a non-starter.

For one large commercial product line, my engineering team estimated that supporting old versions of a runtime cost 15-25% of the features we wanted to do -- both because the old runtime couldn't easily support the more-interesting features, and because supporting multiple runtimes is always more expensive resource-wise than supporting one -- and (of course) doubled QA costs.

Granted, WordPress isn't commercial, and I doubt that PHP4 gets anything but cursory testing.  But anyone that thinks that continued support for PHP4 has no cost is just deluding themselves.

My last post on the topic, thanks!

Message-ID: <40cd893e0705212307i66acc95erb32bd344514529fc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm fudging around with a plugin atm and getting into the depths of
wordpress.  One part of my plugin involves showing public pages which run
some php code (aka not static).  For example, this page may query a table
and print out some data.

What is the best way to accomplish running plugin code in a public-facing
way while still living within the theme and wordpress?  In other words, i
don't want to point the browser directly to /wp-content/plugins/somefile.php
since i want the output to appear within the content part of the blog.

My current solution is to create a WP 'page' with a hook as the content.
("[replace_me]" for example) and then filter out that page with my output
buffered content for the file i want to show.  This feels REALLY hacky and i
was wondering if there was a more elegant "wordpress way" to do this.
Everything else i've done has either been admin stuff or widgets.

Thanks!

Perhaps creating a page template that does not have the Loop. Create  
the page in WP with no content or even Lorem Ipsum type stuff - it  
doesn't matter if you don't invoke the Loop. Use PHP/plugin functions  
as normal.

Custom WordPress pages, on the rocks, shaken not stirred.

Mighty WordPress Developers,

Why did you remove the preview frame in WordPress 2.2?  It was such a
useful UI element, it has really made my life easier.  I'm aware that
there's a "View >" link on the post page, but it's not nearly as
convenient.

I wonder what is the rationale behind such a UI change and I also wonder
no one is missing the preview frame.

Please enlighten me about this.

I am not one of them, but I'll throw in my 2 cents:
I always considered the feature annoying, especially when I was on a 
slow expensive GPRS link and I had to wait for the contents of the frame 
to show up; oh, and it also created problems to me because of the way 
the URL was constructed (messed up the breadcrumb, and sometimes messed 
up the whole page, since I serve application/xhtml+xml).

However, since some people seem to actually find the thing useful, maybe 
allowing it to be enabled would be appropriate :)

Well I'd say the "Cleanest" most-obvious answer is mod_rewrite - that'll
take care of it in a jiffy and keep you in control... Then again, that's
about as "hacky" as it gets :)

Can't you hook into the WP rewrite rules?

Shouldn't it be an option?

It's really useful to me.

I didn't upgraded to 2.2, yet, knowing that will delay my upgrade, even
more.

People that uses complex formating and/or some automated stuff based on
keywords needs to see the post before publishing it.

You cans still preview your posts, just click the preview link and
your post pops up in a new window.

You still can, just not in a slow-loading  && bulky i-frame. With
today's browsers, it's so easy: just middle-click the "view" link and
you're set.

I still think this could be optional, maybe with the preview frame closed
by default.

Having to open a new page everytime I upgrade a post, doesn't seems
productive to me.

In all my blogs it loads pretty fast, so I can't see a reason to remove
the frame.

I think It could be an option, set in user profile, just like visual
editor (witch I don't use, but some of my authors like it).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Missing Menus

Sorry for being slow here but I have been travelling London to Las Vegas and
have only just managed to find a connection.

As to changing the '8' in the menu action call I don't think this makes any
difference unless it is something new in 2.2. I set up a completely clean
and empty 2.2 just before I left and installed this plugin just perfectly as
it is. My user in Delaware did the same thing and it still refuses to run
the activate or the menu hooks but does get listed in the 'active_plugins'
option list. This suggests to me another cause.

I am happy to change the call but this just isn't responsible for his
problems. I guess I am going to have to tell him he just can't use it.!
Thanks anyway
Andy

Well,

On my end, I still have the preview frame (I don't quite like it) but shows
up a 404 error in it for all posts.

Can't find any plugin on my list that should be affecting the writing pane,
any help?

I just knocked up a quick plugin to add back the preview frame, for
those who want it.

Nothing too complex or polished, but there you go :)

@Geoffry:
Sorry, no, I don't agree really that most hosts have real reasons for
not running PHP5. Not after three years. It's a better version with
support for any issues it may have.
Most hosts see shared hosting as a cash cow and are so calcified in
their outlook that they are unwilling to invest the reasonable amount of
time and energy in order to support it. I have come to this conclusion
after talking to lots of hosting companies in the Vancouver area. Some
want to be competitive and quality, most want to just make money and
offer as little service as possible because they don't want to work for
the money they earn. 
Shared hosting is seen as bottom basement service too often. The
industry needs a cattle prod to get out of this attitude.

PS, PHP6 is coming as well, with full Unicode support.

Most hosts have real reasons for not running PHP5, varying from bugs,  
to security holes (there are some security holes in PHP5 that the  
devs refuse to accept exist).

You should keep in mind that, even though PHP is OpenSource, they do
have a trademark policy, and they don't like people messing around with
their trademark. I don't think it's a good idea to distribute modified
versions of the PHP logo, regardless of the upgrading question.

I think a list of mid-to-large hosts that -don't- offer PHP5 would
make more sense, really. It's a roadmap for advocacy, and if it has
enough traffic will hopefully provide wall-of-shame motivation.

PHP6 will be the biggest flop in history. Worse than MS Bob.

Why? Because it'll be OO... At least that's what they say. From what
I've read, the whole point of PHP6 is to make it a "real" programming
language. I hate PHP because it isn't, but let's face it, the reason PHP
is so popular in the first place is because it lets you castrate proper
programming techniques without so much as a squeal.

So if PHP5, in all its simplicity, compatibility, and non-OOP goodiness
hasn't been all that hot, who in their right mind would bet on an
OOP-ified version of PHP actually being popular with anyone?

People use PHP for the same reason MySpacers love HTML: It's too
compatible and lets you do whatever you like while still providing
"results."

That's not to say no one codes right with PHP, but just saying that if
people wanted a REAL language that does REAL code, they'd have gone to
Python or even Perl years ago.

If we're having this endless debate now, I shudder to think what the
state of the WP-Hackers ML will be when PHP6 has been out for a year or
two :)

Quick note that seems to not have been mentioned this time:

If you have the preview opened in a different tab or window you can  
refresh it separately from the rest. This is nice because WP  
autosaves the post periodically and it also means you can do some  
stuff, save, do more stuff, save and only after a while go to the  
preview window/tab and refresh it to see changes.

The URL for the preview can also be opened simultaneously in  
different browsers, if you get a hard-on comparing every single post  
against different browsers (I've seen this often enough to warrant a  
mention).

I find the separate tab/window more useful in this sense than  
reloading the preview every single time I save the post (I tend to  
write long posts).

Not to start a religious war or anything, and I may have had something
stuck in my ear just then, but I could've sworn you called Perl a
"real" programming language.

I'm not even going to acknowledge that Python comment - you must've been joking.

Target software description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerable: WordPress 2.1.3
Patched: WordPress 2.2

http://www.wordpress.org/


Vulnerabilities:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. critical sql injection in "admin-ajax.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's have look @ source code of "wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" ~ line 6:

------------------[source code]----------------------
define('DOING_AJAX', true);

check_ajax_referer();
if ( !is_user_logged_in() )
	die('-1');
------------------[/source code]----------------------

Now let's take a peek at "check_ajax_referer()"

------------------[source code]----------------------
function check_ajax_referer() {
	$cookie = explode('; ', urldecode(empty($_POST['cookie']) ?
$_GET['cookie'] : $_POST['cookie'])); // AJAX scripts must pass
 cookie=document.cookie
	foreach ( $cookie as $tasty ) {
		if ( false !== strpos($tasty, USER_COOKIE) )
			$user = substr(strstr($tasty, '='), 1);
		if ( false !== strpos($tasty, PASS_COOKIE) )
			$pass = substr(strstr($tasty, '='), 1);
	}
	if ( !wp_login( $user, $pass, true ) )
		die('-1');
------------------[/source code]----------------------

We can see "urldecode()" in use ...
So by using "%2527" we can deliver single quotes to "wp_login()", 
effectively bypassing php's "magic_quotes" feature!

Hmm, let's proceed further:


------------------[source code]----------------------
function wp_login($username, $password, $already_md5 = false) {
	global $wpdb, $error;
...
	$login = get_userdatabylogin($username);
------------------[/source code]----------------------


And finally:


------------------[source code]----------------------
function get_userdatabylogin($user_login) {
	global $wpdb;
...
	if ( !$user = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM $wpdb->users
 WHERE user_login = '$user_login'") )
		return false;
------------------[/source code]----------------------

So really there seems to be exist sql injection possibility.
Now it's time for some proof-of-concept fun :)

------------------[PoC test]-----------------------
http://localhost/wordpress.2.1.3/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?
cookie=wordpressuser_5a136e6377f39b00c76957953df945db%253dx%2527gotcha
;+wordpresspass_5a136e6377f39b00c76957953df945db%253dx
------------------[/PoC test]----------------------

... and if WordPress sql error feedback is enabled, then we can see nice
error message:

WordPress database error: [You have an error in your SQL syntax;
check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the
right syntax to use near 'gotcha'' at line 1]

SELECT * FROM wp_users WHERE user_login = 'x'gotcha'

Yeah, it works!! But before testing that PoC cookie suffix must be changed
to currently valid. Here is how it goes:

Example target is:
http://localhost/wordpress.2.1.3/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php Base url for
WordPress installation is: http://localhost/wordpress.2.1.3 And suffix is:

md5('http://localhost/wordpress.2.1.3') = '5a136e6377f39b00c76957953df945db'

And final variable names:

wordpressuser_5a136e6377f39b00c76957953df945db
wordpresspass_5a136e6377f39b00c76957953df945db

One more time: for every target must be calculated specific suffix!

OK, now about exploiting ...

It seems that blind fishing is only method for this security hole. There
is exploit, I have written in php, which will retrieve from database
WordPress admin password md5 hash within few minutes.

Get it from here:

//-----> See ya soon and have a nice day ;) <-----//


How to fix:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WordPress newest version 2.2 is immune against this sql injection. So --> 
http://wordpress.org/download/  <-- update it NOW!

There won't be a security release for the 2.1 branch?

Not as I understand it. 2.0.x is still supported only because of the
jump in MySQL requirements in 2.1.

Please make sure you have your facts straight. :)

WordPress 2.0 is supported because it's in Debian and will continue  
to be maintained until 2010.

WordPress 2.1 is no longer supported due to the accelerated  
development timeline and the weight of supporting multiple such  
releases when, conceivably, there could be three major releases in a  
12 month period. WordPress 2.2 is the heir of WordPRess 2.1.  
WordPress 2.2 probably won't be supported once 2.3 comes out. It's  
still in the air whether 2.3 will be maintained after 2.4 is released.

This is why I started that other thread. You have got to be one of the
most annoying uneducated babbling people of all time. You and people
like you are the reason I am inches away from unsubscribing from this
list and dropping all of this altogether.

Well, we'd still maintain it even if it got dropped from Debian.   
It's just nice to have a stable and secure version that won't be  
changing a couple times a year.

Right.  I figure we'll choose another "long-support-candidate" to  
replace 2.0.x sometime in 2008 or 2009, to give people who want a  
stable platform some time to migrate before 2.0.x is retired.

It might be nice for us to have an official policy about security  
updates though.  We didn't release 2.1.4 because 2.2 was a couple  
weeks away.  Maybe the policy should just be that we'll support the  
current version's branch until there is a newer one.

It takes less effort to take a deep breath and ignore an annoying

The way I understood those discussions as they were happening is that
the SQL bump was the biggest reason for continued support of the 2.0.x
branch, although surely inclusion in Debian is a factor as well. I
don't remember that bit, but I'll certainly take your word for it.

I wouldn't have brought any of this up if the topic hadn't been so
off-topic anyhow.

I stand by what I said, but I'm going to get into a war here or anything
(You are not your code!), and definitely not going to take any of this
personally. PHP isn't a real programming language; stuff like JSP and
ASP are.

Java and ASP are, unfortunately, PITA's to code, compared to PHP. And they
are definitely not, by my definition, good programming languages.

The preview window's iframe HTML code has been long-gone, and if you cleanly
upgraded, it shouldn't be there, except for maybe a plugin.

No,

I am not running any admin theme. Nor do I have any plugin to extend the writing pane.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible bug with endpoints
In-Reply-To: <464E3C75.6020104@poplarware.com>
Message-ID: <C278D37D.30A1%leahy@au.org>

Firstly, thank you Jennifer for your insight. So I have been doing lots of
searching and testing on endpoints. I have written what I have come to
understand about endpoints (please correct me if I am wrong at any point), a
proposal/question about a change to make it more useful and intuitive to
plugin developers, and the tests (seems to be a '0' bug) and plugin.


 add_rewrite_endpoint($name, $place)
 
Adds a new endpoint. An endpoint allows for an additional piece at the end
of WordPress pretty URLs.  For example, the URL for a date archive is
"example.com/YYYY/[MM/[DD/]]" and adding an endpoint of "displayformat"
would create "example.com/YYYY/[MM/[DD/]][displayformat/<endpoint value>]".
There are already several WordPress defined endpoints such as "trackback"
and "paged". 

The params:
 string $name - Is the name of the endpoint and the text to be used in
creating the rewrite rules.

 number $place - This is a bit flag which tells to add the endpoint to what
types of pages (and there associated rewrite rules). There are constants for
the bit flags for the particular places: EP_PERMALINK, EP_ATTACHMENT,
EP_DATE, EP_YEAR, EP_MONTH, EP_DAY, EP_ROOT, EP_COMMENTS, EP_SEARCH,
EP_CATEGORIES, EP_AUTHORS, EP_PAGES, EP_NONE, and EP_ALL.

To retrieve the value of endpoint, use the function get_query_var($name)
where $name is the name of the endpoint. This will return the value after
the endpoint: "<URL>/endpoint/<the returned value for the endpoint>".


----------------------
Proposal/Question about a change

Currently the value returned back for an endpoint is what follows the
endpoint. I understand where this can be useful for multiple values. But
what about when the endpoint is a simple binary value. In which case, it is
more likely that nothing will follow the endpoint in the URL:
"example.com/2007/03/10/hello-world/show-html-source/". If nothing follows
the endpoint, then perhaps another value could be returned. Here are three
possible suggestions:
   1. The name of the endpoint
   2. true
   3. An optional parameter for add_rewrite_endpoint which the default is an
empty string



----------------------

Tests and Observations:

* The filter 'query_vars' has no affect.
* The filter 'request' adds "testendpoint" as [0] to query vars no matter if
the endpoint is present or not.
* get_query_var(<endpoint name>) returns what comes after the endpoint.
* If the value after the endpoint is '0', then the return value is ''.



(1) With the 'request' and with 'query_vars' filter, goto <existing
url>/testendpoint/ 
    Result: get_query_var(0) returns 'testendpoint'
            get_query_var('testendpoint') returns ''

It's exactly what I need.  Works great, thank you!

I've realized reading this thread that for most people the preview frame
was a pain in the ass, but I find it usable anyways.

You've made my day, kudos for you!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible bug with endpoints
In-Reply-To: <C278D37D.30A1%leahy@au.org>

My understanding of the query_vars and request filters (see 
wp-includes/classes.php for the code) is that

a) You use the query_vars to modify the list of variables WP knows 
about. Looks like your plugin function would do that correctly.

b) Then WP goes through this list of variables, to see if they are set 
by either POST, GET, permalink parsing, or some other manner, storing 
their values in an array of variable values. However, I agree with 
what you are saying: if the endpoint has no value after it, I think it 
doesn't get stored because the test used is 
!empty($perma_query_vars[$wpvar]) and '' and 0 are both "empty" 
according to the PHP doc on php.net.

c) This resulting array of values is passed to the request filter, for 
you to modify. I think the plugin function you wrote for query_vars 
will not work for that filter, because the result needs to be an 
associative array of endpoint => value.

Anyway, I think maybe you are right that the endpoint code ought to be 
modified for it to work for you, but I am not sure what else it might 
break.

By the way, another possibility is to do something in the init that 
checks for your "endpoint" by parsing the URL directly, and then set 
some kind of global variable. It may be easier than trying to coerce 
the query vars and rewrite code to do what you want.

Another possibility is to define permalinks directly instead of using 
endpoints, which gives you more flexibility on what is stored in the 
variable array (for instance, you can set a value to 1). You use the 
generate_rewrite_rules action for that.  Of course, you have to add a 
lot of rules to simulate an endpoint.

Good luck,
      Jennifer

Yeah, that's the beauty of computers: so many options, so many opinions,
so many ways to do something that's impossible for any two people to
perfectly agree. It's what puts the challenge in coding and keeps it fun :)

I originally designed my plugin in to do as your first suggestion of
directly parsing the URL and after all of this came to the same idea as your
second suggestion. I have been attempting more and more to have my plugins
utilize the WordPress API; but realistically, that will never 100% possible.

Thanks for the help Jennifer.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Atom Publishing Protocol work - Ticket 4191
Message-ID: <4655848F.7000903@torrez.us>

Hi hackers,

I might have introduced myself before, but I'll do it quickly again. I
work at IBM for an innovations team in the CIO office (bleech), anyways,
I like to work in open source and standards. I use WordPress personally
and also participate in the Atom APP workging group at the IETF. I have
been working on the WordPress AtomPP implementation for sometime now and
that's what we have included in WordPress 2.2. Before today, the
workflow was that I'd submit a patch and wait for Dougal to verify
before it was committed. The turn around time and other things make this
 really hard to make progress and leads to very large patches.

After chatting with Matt, he suggested I write to the list for everyone
to be involved in the review process as well as me sending smaller (more
understandable) patches. I had a huge patch that did some unconventional
conversion from tabs to spaces making it very unreadable. I fixed it,
but it's still a bit larger then usual. I would like people to review it
and suggest we commit it. From now, I'll stay more closely aligned with
the releases and make sure we have a robust APP implementation as the WG
is hopefully???? near completion. We are I'd say 75% there and I'm
willing to put in the time, but I need to know the commitment of the
group to quickly review small patches and commit without depending on a
single third-person to review.

Behold the patch -> http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4191

Looking forward to working with the community here at large.

Please do.  This isn't a support forum.

They would be well advised to seek assistance elsewhere.

And just in case you are one of the many people who reply to this list
with "unsubscribe"...

All you need to do to unsubscribe is go here:
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/options/wp-hackers?email=wjames@nels
onbay.com

Step 1: Type your password and hit unsubscribe.

If you typed your password correctly, it will work.

If not, then there is a password reminder button there too.

If that still doesn't work then you've probably subscribed through
another service.

Look in the header of your email for info.

Best wishes on your future endeavors...

Just to be pedantic, but you don't need to enter a password for it to
work.  This means that if someone asks "How do I unsubscribe?" you can
actually go to the management page & send the confirmation email for
them.

Which I did in case they didn't manage to follow... so nobody else do it. Heh.

What?!?!  Agh no man, I'm so disappointed!  :-(
I've been trying to decrypt the l33t c0d3z on this mailing list for months!!
No wonder!

*sigh*

You know what guys, on a serious note, I'm very impressed with the
adult way that this poor sod's mail was handled, it's not often one
finds oneself on a mailing list where there's not an immediate
lash-out at mails like his...  It just goes to show that Wordpress
will have a strong development team for a long, long time. :-)  Well
done. :)

I've seen a lot worse... like "who are you people? wtf are you sending 
me all these emails for?" and the like (either a result of a well done 
bad joke, or the guy forgot he had signed up to the list); and I suppose 
others have seen similar, too, it doesn't attract attention after a while.

Hi Elias,

I wrote a validating atom mod a while back for WordPress 2.1.x (I 
recently updated it for 2.2).

If there is anything useful in it, please feel to use it:

Hello,

(This is my first post here, so please be gentle :-)  )

I'm working on an in-house forked version of Wordpress MU.

My question involves the "comments" table.  (Typically named something like
"wp_abc_comments".)

Within that table there is a field named "comment_author".

I've found that values in this table are in "HTML escaped" format.

So... "&" appears as "&amp;", etc.

My question is... is this who it is suppose to be?

(Or have I discovered a bug?)


See ya

yes, probably; since comment_author is supposed to be displayed as HTML, 
the entities are supposed to be escaped, and doing it when the comment 
is saved instead of doing it on display adds a slight (depending on the 
comment count and traffic, it can actually become significant) speed 
improvement (saves a htmlentities run on every comment on every display 
in the worst - and most common - case when caching isn't used).

For any not following the testers threads, Ryan has posted this over
there, but I don't think it made it to Hackers:

Re: Beware Trunk
"A lot more just went in.  There's still a ways to go, but the new
taxonomy is almost usable.  Note that all of your existing categories
and tags will no longer show up since there isn't any upgrade code
yet.  If someone wants to work on a migrator that migrates the old
tag/cat schema to the new taxonomy schema, the taxonomy API should be
up to the challenge.  Let's bundle it as an importer like we do with
UTW and the cat to tag migrator.  And speaking of UTW and cat2tag,
both of those importers need to be updated.

If you get errors like "Duplicate entry 'x' for key 1", you probably
have an early version of the term_relationships table that had a bad
primary key.  Delete that table and bump $db_version in version.php to
force another upgrade.

Ryan"

I haven't been following this-- are hierarchical categories going away 
entirely?

I did see that and conveniently glossed over it assuming it didn't  
apply to me. Whatever.

So I have to ask the question. Why are we bundling an importer from  
cats to terms. It seems everyone is going to lose their categories.  
The migration needs to not be a bundled solution but part of the  
upgrade routine. Or am I still totally missing the boat here?

First thing, the category-to-tag converter is nonfunctional now. I wrote it
when the first generation of tags (the one that got ripped out) was in the
code.

Second of all, the plan is still to have link categories, post categories
and tags. Hierarchy, too.

Ok, that's good. Understand I'm not upset as I ask for this kind of  
thing by running trunk. I acknowledge that. What I don't understand  
is if that was the case, why was the code changed relating to  
post2cat or category listings in wp-admin?

terms should simply add on to that, right? Curious, thats all. If I  
have to write the code, I'll do it. I just want to understand the  
reasoning.

Terms are just terms. We have "categories," "link categories" and "tags"
which are all "terms."

I have to agree with Lloyd Budd's original idea and the people on here
that have thought of the marketing aspect. WordPress is increasingly
seeing competition, and having a new full number release will allow
WordpPress to market itself as a mature product.

Way too many of you on here are ignoring the marketing aspect, going
"but we are coders, we like point revisions, and jumping is dumb", but
if you look at how successful WordPress is now, you have to give
credit to its marketing. It has always jumped release numbers to show
the world that it had matured in some way, and I think it is ready for
that again.

I also agree that for publishers, selling a book on WordPress 3 is
easier than 2.3 or 2.4. And you have to admit, that a book about
WordPress 2.0 won't cover many of the great new things that will be in
2.3... and it will be plain wrong about other things.

Help the users get new books, vote yes to WordPress v3.

Nit pick:
which are all "terms." ->
which *all use* "terms."

e.g.:
category id #25 -> labeled with term #8 "kittens"
tag id #436 -> labeled with term #45 "kitten"
etc
:)

juuuust so we're clear.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I believe they are all still terms. We store them all
in a terms table, and they're just different *types* of terms.

For example, category "News" is a term that has its type set to 'category.'
I'd have to look at the recently added terms code to double check, however.

Thanks for the pointers. I'll definitely look at it in case there's

OK, time for the n00bish question :P

Atom Publishing Protocol vs. Atom API-- same thing, different things,  
AtomPP = latest edition of Atom API?

Thanks!

"Security analyst David Kierznowski shocked bloggers yesterday with a survey
showing that 49 out of the 50 WordPress blogs he checked seem to be running
<http://blogsecurity.net/wordpress/articles/article-230507/>  exploitable
versions of the widely used software. He said, 'The main concern here is the
lack of security awareness amongst bloggers with a non-technical background,
and even those with a technical background.' Mr Kierznowski also uncovered
recent vulnerabilities in
<http://michaeldaw.org/papers/securing_wp_plugins/>  WordPress plugins that
ship by default with the software, adding: 'WordPress users developing
plugins must be aware of the security functions that WordPress supports, and
ensure that these functions are used in their code.'"

Would it be a good idea to have the top of the dashboard have in a big
red box:

"You are running wordpress n. Because of security concerns you should
upgrade to wordpress m immediately."

I realize that the new releases are in the development blog feed and
that the current version of your blog is at the bottom but these would
appear to be too easily overlooked.

It would have been interesting if the survey said how many of those
blogs were being actively used.

longer login and update, but are still sitting there on the Internet,
waiting to be hacked...

I was teaching a class on using WordPress, and I realized how limiting the
title of "Blogroll" was especially to developers using it as a CMS.  I
suggest having it changed to "Links" or some other variant for UI
consistency.  More rational and the patch is in TRAC.

Agreed. Not everyone considers they're WP site a blog, or the sites they
link to as blogs. I vote for "Links" as well.

I agree. Changing the name to "Links" would be a better idea. +1 for change!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Fresh Meat: Open Web Analytics for WordPress
Message-ID: <BEAD9393-048B-4339-A0F1-7AE0C04BD73F@oncefuture.com>

Hi all -

Thanks to help from folks on this list, I've recently released the  
Open Web Analytics (OWA) framework for WordPress. OWA is a generic  
web analytics framework that comes with tight integration for  
WordPress and MediaWiki (phpBB and Gallery2 are in the works).

Installs as a regular WordPress plugin and has been tested under v2.0  
-v2.2.  In you are interested, see http://www.openwebanalytics.com  
for the code and install instructions.

WordPress specific features include:

* Track visitors by WordPress user name or e-mail address they use in  
comments.
* Track all Wordpress Page Types (Posts, Pages, Authors, Archives,  
Categories, etc.)
* Track the number of comments made by visit
* Reporting accessable via Admin Dashboard
* Track subscribers to RSS/Atom feeds
* Track multiple WordPress instances using the same OWA database

Core Features:

* Track Page views, visits, and unique visitors over time
* Track unique, new, repeat visitors over time
* Multiple Web Site Support - track any number of web sites and view  
statistics in aggregate or by site
* Log events can be written to the database asynchronously.
* Click-streams - view the actual click-stream of each visitor
* Click Tracking - Track where exactly on a web page users are  
clicking and view clicks by browser type
* Click Heat Maps - view a heat map of where users are clicking on  
your web pages
* Google Maps - map your visitors on Google Maps
* Google Earth (KML) - view your visitors in Google Earth via a KML  
file export
* RSS/ATOM subscription tracking - track unique feed readers, reader  
types, and feed requests
* Visitor Aging - understand the age of your repeat visitors.
* Canned and Custom Time Periods - generate reports using pre-defined  
reporting periods or custom date ranges
* Referring Page Analysis - View the title, anchor text, and  
surrounding text of inbound links from referring web pages
* View visits by user agent
* Track entry and exit pages
* Track pages by custom page types

There is a still _a lot_ left to be done here but hopefully this will  
come in handy for those of you looking to add analytics to your  
plugins or themes.

Thanks in advance for any feedback or bug reports.

-P-

Agreed. Will make it easier to explain it's function to non-blogging  
users.

Even though in ticket 3695 the patch uses "bookmark" I'm going to have to
put in a clear vote for "Links" which is more understandable to someone who
doesn't use say del.icio.us for example.

Also, does anyone else notice that TRAC sends e-mails when you modify
tickets, but it doesn't send them when others modify ones you've put in?
That seems rather backwards.

Put your email address, OR assign an email address in your Trac profile,  
and put your trac username into the CC field of the report.
Note that your trac username is case sensitive for that functionality.

This is a decent workaround, until somebody accidentally removes you  
from the cc list.

I agree with Chris though, it's weird that Trac makes it so difficult  
to stay notified about a bug you originated.

I made the same suggestion last October before 2.1 (which changed the
title from "Links" to "Blogroll") was released:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/009301.html

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/009347.html

Almost all the messages in those threads favoured making that admin menu
title either "Links" or "Bookmarks", rather than "Blogroll" as it was in
2.1 alpha. By then it had already been changed to "Blogroll" on
wordpress.com, however. The release version followed the wordpress.com
usage. 

How about an option to name that menu as any one of "Links", Bookmarks",
"Blogroll" or whatever (with appropriate changes to the menu page text)?
Perhaps with an option to make it a submenu of the "Manage" menu rather
than a main menu item?

I think either "Links" or "Bookmarks" would be fine, since they aren't
purpose-specific like "Blogroll" is, but IMO preferably the first one
because it would enable more flexibility in use.

Putting Links/Bookmarks/Blogroll under a sub-tab in Manage is a great idea.
Our Links/Bookmarks/Blogroll management is a rather small venture, and I'm
sure it would fit.

Well, it's made that way, I would think, in politeness. If you wanted to
know what updates the ticket receives, then feel free to put your
username/email in the CC field, but other people might not want tons of
messages.

Getting notified of your own changes was recently (recently = 3 weeks or so)
added to Trac, but I'm subscribed to WP-Trac so I get it all, anyways :).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Integrate URLs from custom plugins?
Message-ID: <370347.11417.qm@web34508.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi WP-hackers! 

I have a question that I've haven't found any answers
to in other Wordpress-resources, so my apologies if
this is already answered/solved before. 

Maybe my strategy below is wrong, but then I would be
very glad if anyone would point me in the right
direction.. 

I'm migrating a website to the Wordpress platform. One
part of the website is a weekly newsletter archive
where you can access certan newsletters this way: 

http://domain.com/newsletters/year(number)/week(number)/

Basicly, what I want to do is to send Wordpress to my
newsletter page (a wordpress page with a custom
template) that processes the url and shows the
newsletter. 

Tried following strategies without any luck: 
* a rewrite like this in htaccess:
RewriteRule ^newsletter/([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/?($
nyhetsbrev/?year=$1&week=$2

* use the "page_template"-action hook together with
$_SERVER["REDIRECT_URI"]. This only seems to work for
the domain.com/newsletters/year(number)/ part. If I
user the full url as above, I end up at the 404 page. 

* use the "posts_request"-filter together with
$_SERVER["REDIRECT_URI"] and write the full sql-query
to the wanted page. Gives the same 404 page as above.

* I tried to use "post_rewrite_rules"-filter together
with something like the htaccess-rewrite-rule. However
I don't really know how to use it and this haven't
given me any results at all yet. 

So, is this totally wrong or what am I missing above?
Is there another way to achieve the same results? 

I am thankful for any kind of input in this matter. 


Thanks,

Tobias 
Sweden

I agree that it should be links. I also agree that it should be under
Manage. I never quite got why it was it's over Menu...

It's a pretty good plugin. Although you gotta wonder why it's 5MBs, while WP
is only 3MBs...

In the reporting section, you should put alt texts on the images. Also, I
think you forgot to end a tag or something, because on the Dashboard, the
normal WP Admin footer ends up in 1 of those fieldset's. It's also a little
bulky to go through the stats. It needs to be more lightweight and
organised. It's also a little slow to.

Otherwise, it looks pretty useful. :D

and a few other fairly large files, all of which realistically are

Where it would be particularly useful is if all the core stuff was moved into a separate library with api and then the plugin could be uber-lightweight making api calls. Taking the next step, it could sniff for memcaching, and use that for the api calls if memcached exists.

There's quite a bit of abstraction that could be done to truly make it "open" but loviing the start. :)

Is there someplace where this is being discussed? And where interested

+1 From me on this as well. Either "Links" or "Bookmarks" would be fine. 
While doing that, change up the links that are currently there too! 
Something like I suggested before.. whoo hoo! :P

Subject: [wp-hackers] the_excerpt should have parameters
Message-ID: <8BDCC0DA-5E6B-43F9-B599-75D453C72ACA@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'd like to raise a suggestion, based on a lot of feedback I get from  
clients. the_excerpt() function currectly has no tags, but they're a  
few things that users usually want to control, and not possible.

1. the length of the excerpt. I know it can be controlled more  
effectively with the_content() and <!--more-->, but not everyone has  
the patience to do that with every post, all they want is a different  
length.

2. the [...] at the end. i've got loads of requests to remove or  
change it. having that as a parameter in the_excerpt() could be  
really helpful.

3. the_excerpt() strips the html tags out of the post. now, this  
gives the desiarable affect %95 of the time, and I understand that  
it's done to prevent validation errors (though it's not done when the  
post is cut in half with <!--more-->) but sometimes, like when  
someone post a video from youtube and wants it to show in the  
excerpt, it might be useful to be able to change this setting.

Does the Feed Stats also go for the Comment Feeds, or just the Entries Feed?
Also, for some odd reason, the graph doesn't show Google Reader, but I know
for a fact I have a couple of readers using it...

Sounds like a candidate for a nice plugin! If it doesn't already  
exist...

parameter vars:
- length (characters or words or sentences. smart truncate? beware  
scripts like kanji! )
- prompt (the [...] thing)
- prompt link to permalink true | false

for the filtering, perhaps an options screen where the user can check  
off some standard stuff they want to keep/allow
- links
- images
- embedded objects
- iframes

or just pass these as parameters too...

just what I thought seeing this. cheers.

I agree that we should have parameters on this tag.  I would like to see a
parameter to set the before/after containing tag and not default to a
paragraph.

Message-ID: <465A1EB7.2080802@mullenweg.com>

For those of you running WordPress in high-volume environments, I've set 
up a mailing list you should join:

http://comox.textdrive.com/mailman/listinfo/hyperdb

We're releasing the DB class we use for WordPress.com to the world. 
Amoung other things, it supports:

* Replication
* Failover
* Redundant (public/private) networks
* Local and remote datacenters
* Partitioning
* Different tables on different DBs
* Advanced stats for profiling
* More...?

We're calling it HyperDB, and it's a drop-in replacement for WPDB, it 
just has some different configuration settings.

Anyway, if any of this sounds interesting, drop by the hyperdb list and 
introduce yourself and we can start diving into the code.

Maybe we could use a wiki page in TRAC?  Sounds like an information

Wow! That looks perfect. Though IMO it shouldn't be a plugin. In the  
ideal situation it should be in the root, but even if not, i'd put it  
in the theme's functions.php for the theme using it (so the theme  
doesn't relay on a plugin to work, which is never too good,  
especially not for something basic like this.)

Message-ID: <3105EBB7-C1E4-4062-8562-C2A18D0B7B34@pixline.net>

I've just some doubts I wanted to share with you: I'm actually  
required to export a WPMU blog and move it into a brand new  
standalone wordpress, but I can't understand why my WPMU export file  
will not import into a vanilla WP22. I had to work roughly on  
phpmyadmin and mess with tables manually to get some decent results,  
but maybe I've

My doubts are:
1) WPMU 1.2.1 is the code-counterpart of WP22, or WP22 is based on a  
different version?
2) What charset will be used creating the WP-XML export file?
3) I'm actually running 1.1.1 (or at least I suppose that), so I'd  
better upgrade WPMU first, then export, then import into WP22?

Apart from that, I'm really ignorant about xml-rpc, but I was  
wondering about a import script like the "import links" one, allowing  
a brand new wp22 to 'suck' another WP installation by itself, without  
any xml ('cause my personal blog won't import by xml: I'm not having  
that memory on my server!). Do you think it would be possible, xmlrpc  
or not? And if you think it's possible, someone wants to code this  
with me? :-)

Thank you for your time, I beg your pardon for my english, but here  
is early morning and I'm not having my coffee.. :-D

An open discussion and review of the proposal.

If we are going to reorganise the menu structure to improve usability
then we need to make sure that it works well for all classes of user and
 that we provide good clear guidelines on where we recommend plugin and
theme authors add there pages.

Getting the correct set of top level menu names is going to be the most
difficult thing I expect.

Classifying the different user cases under these heading will be less
difficult - but with the current scheme it is unclear where to find some
 of the features.

idem for me. 'links' would be fine.
and, while we are talking on this, I've a related question (but maybe  
it's not the right place, so please excuse me):
we can get rid of 'blog' into wpmu default blog (or personalize/ 
change it during installation)?
It would helps in some wpmu-as-heavy-cms setup like our next... :-)

Message-ID: <196d50d70705280345o146e485fu7fc3103fb8271028@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been getting a lot of bug reports for one of my plugins under
Wp 2.2 using widgets. I know the call to install a widget changed to
remove some mucky code but since has been changed back to the original
way of doing it, with a release coming as 2.2.1(?)

Question is - if I change the plugin to fix the bug in 2.2, is that
going to break it when the next release (with the reverted widget
code) is installed?

I notice there is a fix here  http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4316
which could presumably be coded to only apply when number was not
being passed. Are there any other issues?

Thanks,

Martin

Is should. the plugin uses is_feed() to determine if the request is  
for a feed.
The reason Google Reader isn't there is due to some silliness that  
I'm using to report user agents in that graph - which I'll fix in the  
next release.

Thanks for taking a look.

That's where it's headed. There is a core API that enables access to  
modules and plugins. right now everything is stuffed into one base  
module. ;)
I'm hoping that the module system and API makes it easy for folks to  
create additional WP plugins that display stats in widgets for example.

If you use the new wp_* prefixed functions mentioned in #4275, your plugin
will work with 2.2.1.  The wp_ functions work properly.

Don't change to accommodate the bug in the unprefixed functions.  That bug
will be gone in 2.2.1.

Then maybe you should seperate the statistics for the Entires Feed and the
Comments Feed. Or are they already.

Maybe that file should be broken up into smaller files and only call the
ones you need. Because calling a 3MB file is probably what's slowing down
the page loads.

All the different feed types should get picked up and tracked  
separately. is_feed() is used by the plugin to identity that the WP  
request is for a feed but then it looks at the _$GET['feed'] param to  
set specific page_type for that feed request.

it's a good point, the fewer calls to 'require', the better.

The 3MB of JPGraph files are not all called or required on every  
request. They are accessed through the API only when specific ones  
are needed to generate a graph of a specific type.

I need to do more profiling to see where the execution time is being  
spent.

Thanks again,

-P-

I would really love to have that feature.
Would make really easier using WP as a CMS (or even a development  
framework), without using spare libraries and code the whole thing as  
in the WP-PEAR idea (which could be useful in some case, but heavy in  
some others).
++1 for me :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Perhaps OT PHP Question
Message-ID: <C280B516.242A%chris@clwill.com>

This is a rudimentary question, I'm sure... But I am beating my head against
the wall.

I have a trivial plug-in thus:

function shakes_get_cat ($categories, $r) {
    if ('list' == $r['style']) {
        foreach ($categories as $category) {
            if (ctype_digit(substr($category->cat_name, 0, 2))) {
                $category->cat_name = $category->category_description;
            }
        }
    }
    return $categories;
}
add_filter('get_categories', 'shakes_get_cat', 10, 2);

On my local test machine (php 5.2, wp 2.2) it works perfectly.  On the
server (php 4.?, wp 2.2) it doesn't.  The $categories array is unchanged.

Any help?  I know this is something obvious, but...

Unless you have 100's of Drafts. :P

I think a "Drafts" page would be better. With a separation of Post Drafts
and Page Drafts.

LOL! Yeah, now my curiosity  is going.  Well, I have some free time 
here... I'll make up about  XX to XXX amounts of crap drafts once and 
see what happens.. lmao! Oh wait, never mind I don't have that much free 
time on my hands haha... I wonder about that though, if it would be a 
next page feature on this change up or not..? But yeah, the separation 
would be a cool thing too.

Not that.  If I change it to:

foreach ($categories as $category) {
    $categories->cat_name = 'mud';
}

It still doesn't change it.

I've even changed the whole thing (no if at all) to that, $categories never
gets modified in the plug-in.  It IS getting called, I put echo statements
in there, and they are showing....

Any other ideas?

PHP 5 made changes to variable references. The loop isn't working
because you're changing the cat_name on a copy of the category, then
leaving that copy to be thrown away when the loop ends.

For my money the simplest workaround is this:

foreach ($categories as $key => $category) {
   $categories[$key] = "whatever";
}

But there are half a dozen other options. Try the `foreach` page in
the manual if you want more.

You're right about what he's doing, but shouldn't that also happen in  
PHP 5? Unless he precedes $category in the loop declaration with an  
ampersand, shouldn't it also operate as a copy in PHP 5? Or am I  
missing something?

Does OWA play nice with WP-Cache? I.e., does using WP-Cache alter the
OWA results in any way?

I think objects pass by reference by default. If $category were a
string (etc.) then the ampersand would be required.

Thanks! What's WP-PEAR? Couldn't find anything on it.

My main hope is to allow plugin developers the ability to modify the 
admin mechanisms without touching the core code. It's pretty much 
impossible right now.

Anyone have some feedback on how best to approach this?

I thought of maybe encapsulating each section into an array that's only 
run when needed. That way you'd allow developers to rearrange the load 
order, break off pieces individually, etc. What's most WP-centric based 
on existing practices?

I've read it some time ago:

On: [wp-hackers] [Fwd: [photomatt] An idea to benefit open source

Date: 	16 april 2007 21:26:32 GMT+02:00

[...] Greg Beaver has recently done a lot of work on the PEAR  
installer, and it now supports channels and other really neat  
features. The PEAR installer would be an excellent fit to put some of  
WP's reusable functions out for everyone to enjoy. [...]

Wouldn't it be nice? :-) In Pixline we are focusing on WP as CMS or  
develop framework, more than a blog engine, so both wp-pear and your  
approach would really help us to grow and - finally - do our work as  
we like to do it...

Maybe a combination of arrays (what sections in what places) and  
hooks (add/remove that interface)? Just wondering...

Hi there,

Not sure if this is the appropriate place for my question, if not, my
apologies.

One thing i'm missing in WP (or I missed it so far...) is the possibily to
create usergroups. (apart from the roles)

 

I would like to make groups of users that can view and post to one or more
specific categories. Thus, give a groups of users access to certain
categories.

I found a plugin that can do the job for individual users
(categorie-access), but that will give a lot of slack and maintenance
issues.

 

Is there an existing way to do this, or are there plans of putting this in a
new version? IMHO, it would make the system a lot more versatile.

 

Thanks in advance,

Jochem

in 2.2: admin-functions.php, lines 2217-2310

function wp_create_thumbnail( $file, $max_side, $effect = '' ) {
		// 1 = GIF, 2 = JPEG, 3 = PNG
[...]


Probably in the same file you'll find the other functions you need.

Hi,

admin-functions.php
line 2217: function wp_create_thumbnail

Hope this helps,

ps: Next time you could do a for words like thumbnail ;) My preffered 
tool of choice in this case is jEdit.

All the best,

Look at the Role Manager and Page Organiser plugins. These with a bit of 
custom code will do the job I think.

In outline, what you need to do is this, in a plugin:

1) Define a couple of query variables and a rewrite rule in WordPress 
to match your URL structure.

2) Use the the template_redirect action to redirect to your newsletter 
page when this URL is requested.

Here are some reference articles (see also articles referenced in 
these articles, if you need more background):

http://codex.wordpress.org/Query_Overview - explains how WordPress 
processes URLs

query variables and rewrite rules

Good luck!

This report has been discussed to death on trac [1]

The long and the short of it is:

The POC doesn't work.

Yes any user with Unfiltered HTML can post javascript in a comment.

The POC claims this can be automated with a remote posting javascript -
i.e. by visiting another site which does it with your stored cookies.

This is however blocked by a specific nonce check as I described in [2]

I agree, but out of interest why don't we nonce comments? It seems
like we could stop a lot of comment spam and seal up this kind of
vulnerability if we did.

Theme compatibility issues?

Yeah I know. I defended you in one of the tickets because the guy was  
being an ass to everyone who was pointing out that the POC doesn't  
work. That's why I say "I still still still". :)

We nonce admin comments (well, comments by anyone with the  
unfiltered_html capability).  If the nonce fails or isn't there, the  
admin doesn't get to post unfiltered_html.  That is what prevents  
this POC from working.

Noncing all comments would be a club solution [1].  And it'd be  
useless against spam bots who first slurp the form (and thus the  
nonce).  The more people who had this (like, if it were in core), the  
less effective it would be.  And yes, theme compatibility would be a  
slight hurdle, though that's not the main reason.

good question. I haven't tested OWA with WP-Cache.

OWA for WordPress includes an IMG tag in the page footer for new  
visitors that is used to process their first hit to the web site.  
this eliminates the "one-hit" robot session over counting issue that  
FUBARs most web analytics. Without that IMG tag being present on the  
page new visitors will not get their sessions logged.

Right now, that IMG tag is included conditionally if the persistent  
cookie is not found, but it doesn't need to work that way. I'll add a  
config option for that in the next release.

Subject: [wp-hackers] the_excerpt suggestion
Message-ID: <54e76e300705291532p21e16b85ncf29cf2ecda4782@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Developpers,

I'd like to propose a suggestion, a better way to insert a photo in a post
to display it in his excerpt.

I wanted to upload a photo for a post and include it in the post and in the
excerpt with a full link to the post.  This way, when someone click on a
photo they saw in Search ( or elsewhere ), he's directed to the post. ( I
know that they can click on the name of the post to see the whole post. )
But when I upload a photo and insert with "Show : Thumbnail" and "Link to :
Page", it inserts a link to the photo, not to the actual post. Do you find
this normal?

This is only possible by editing the link created in Upload a Photo.

My idea is the following :
1. I start creating/editing a post.
2. I insert a Post Title.
3. I start writing my content.
4. Wordpress auto-saves the post.
5. When he auto-saves, he also create the Post Slug ( if it's not already
inserted by the writer ).
6. I upload a photo.
7. I insert it in the post in his original form.
8. I also insert in excerpt with "Show : Thumbnail" and "Link to : Post" and
"Insert in : Excerpt".
9. When I went to the archive, I can see the picture linked to the Post.

Is this possible with Ajax and some changes in the Upload file?
BTW, I'm asking you gals/guys because I believe this must be implemented in
the core.

Mustafa Suphi Yilmaz

Subject: [wp-hackers] Upgrade.php Loop?
Message-ID: <465D27AA.5090105@NeoSmart.net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I updated to SVN Trunk right after the terms db-changes were committed.
I've been really busy and didn't get a chance to update again until today.

However, I now have a problem: I go to wp-admin, get prompted to upgrade
the db, upgrade, then get prompted to upgrade again.

Thank god the main site is working, but I can't access anything in the
admin center.

It claims the upgrade was successful, but I can't seem to break out of
this loop.

The first time I ugraded I got the "standard" error about a duplicate
index or something, nothing harmful. I don't see any errors now though.

Any thoughts? Anyone else having this issue?

Hi --

The "new features" for WordPress 2.1 states:

"You can set any 'page' to be the front page of your site, and put  
the latest posts somewhere else, making it much easier to use  
WordPress as a content management system."

How the heck do I do this???  I can't find the setting anywhere!

In the admin panel go to Options/Reading and set a static page.

Thanks for the explanation Ryan, much appreciated.

A few of my plugins switch to keeping the options panel/etc. in the
Widget if they are enabled, using a test "if (
function_exists('register_sidebar_widget') )" which won't work now -
the function always exists for compatibility.

An alternative is to keep options out of the Widgets at all times
(i.e. just put the options on an options page & keep the widget
control for "title" and nothing else) but I'd be interested to know if
there are alternatives.  It would also be useful to detect that
widgets are disabled/not supported and save running the code to load
them.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Martin

Message-ID: <465DD965.6020100@ntlworld.com>

Hi
have upgraded to WP 2.2,
after standard new install, with default theme, noticed my debugger 
complaining as follows:
\wp-includes\wp-db.php line 204 - mysql_num_fields(): supplied argument 
is not a valid MySQL result resource
\wp-includes\wp-db.php line 209 - mysql_fetch_object(): supplied 
argument is not a valid MySQL result resource
\wp-includes\wp-db.php line 214 - mysql_free_result(): supplied argument 
is not a valid MySQL result resource

I think this is due to the query "SET NAMES..." which returns true, not 
a resource.
Any one else notice this?
Thanks
Chris.

Maybe an is_resource() is needed.

Hi all,

some of you know the InstantUpgrade plugin and apprechiate its simple
and clean upgrading. Now there is a new version in development, which
doesn't need the blog owner to mess with file permissions -- it does the
file transfers via FTP.

However, this feature needs plenty of testing before we can release it
to the general public, so I'd ask you very kindly, please visit
http://zirona.com/blog/software/instantupgrade-10-alpha1-testers-needed
download a copy and test the plugin. And please spread the word about
this dev release.

If we get this thing stable, this could be a revolution in maintaining
WordPress installations. 

Thank you very much in advance.


Best regards,
Alex

The first thing that strikes me on the setup screen....  Is it just  
me or is my FTP password going to be stored in plaintext in the  
database?  This seems like a security vulnerability to me.

MySQL gurus out there will be able to tell me if I'm being paranoid  
or not.... :)

Otherwise this looks like a very impressive plugin!

This is indeed a thing worth being discussed.

In my opinion, it is not an (additional) security risk, because usually,
FTP passwords are transmitted in plaintext anyway from your PC to your
server. And in this case, the password is only transmitted from your
(HTTP) server to your (FTP) server, so it doesn't even go across the
internet. The storage of the password is in the WP database, and
usually, nobody but the admin will be able to read the options from
there.

But if somebody can convince me that I'm wrong and/or has an idea how to
make it better, I'll be happy to consider it.

Best regards,
Alex

Functionally it's looking good Alex,

A couple of small points, would it be possible to determine the 'FTP
path to WordPress' (under InstantUpgrade Config) automatically? I
wasn't immediately sure what value to put in here and had to try a
couple of paths before I got the right one.

There's a typo at the top of the Config screen - 'separetely' instead
of separately.

I'm not a fan of the top-level menu one bit. I reckon you could easily
squeeze all your options into a submenu of Manage or Plugins. You
could even combine the configuration screen with the actual upgrade
screen if necessary.

John.

Wouldn't it be "wp_register_sidebar_widget"?

I would go through all the 2.3 tickets ([1]); that's a good place to start.

has-patch is probably fine, commit is stuff that is ready to go and
dev-feedback (attention) is when the ticket needs a dev's opinion on
something.

If you're using the plugin that came with WP2.2 use
wp_register_sidebar_widget. I you still have it as a plugin, use
register_sidebar_widget.

Yeh, my bad. The problem is that from WP 2.2 that function always
exists so it is not a reliable way to check whether Widgets are
enabled. Is there a new method for checking?

I believe widgets are allways enabled in WP 2.2 (since it is no longer a 
plugin, but in the core), so there's no need to check for it.

If you need backwards compatibility, then you should keep checking for the 
function "register_sidebar_widget".

They're always enabled but not always active - e.g. if the theme is
not compatible.

Previously people tended not to enable the Widgets plugin if they're
theme didn't support them (I think there was a warning also) meaning
that the check for the function also indicated that they were
supported.

Previously my plugins used to do the check & if Widgets were found and
installed it put the configuration options in the Widget (i.e. self
contained). If Widgets weren't found it output a configuration page
under Options ->

It's actually been a bit of a support/usability nightmare so I'm
stripping this out of all the plugins in favour of using the
Options->Menu method regardless.  Mostly I'm just asking out of
interest: Is there a reliable way to check that Widgets are enabled
(a.k.a. supported by the current theme).

Going off on a tangent a little, but what is the impact on Sidebar
Modules (found in K2). Previously that used the same calls
(register_sidebar_widget) meaning it would die if both Modules &
Widgets were installed.  Presumably now it's impossible to install
Modules because the widgets functions are built in?

Thanks for all the info by the way - I've fixed the plugins that were
causing the problems, now I'm just curious.

They're still enabled even if a theme is not compatible, I believe. The only
case in which the core widgets would not be enabled would be if another
widgets plugin removed its call from the plugins_loaded action (I think
that's the action).

I think I need to learn to explain myself clearly(!)

Is there a simple way to tell, from a plugin, whether the current
theme supports Widgets?  I think that would be the equivalent
functionality I was looking for.

As I say though it's a moot point now - I've changed all the affected plugins.

I understand what you mean, but I don't understand why you would want to test 
on that (unless you are making a theme-validation plugin).

You should register the widget anyway, either it is being called for (if the 
theme supports it) or it's not. Your plugin should also have a convenient 
function for use in themes that doesn't support widgets. That should be 
explained in a readme/install file.

The original reason for doing it was that a number of my plugins are
widget-plugin hybrids in that they can be used either way.

If a plugin is installed as a widget it didn't seem to make sense to
have the options under Options->etc. when there is a configuration
panel on the widget itself. It takes up room and means that when
setting up the widget you're asking users to go to two places to do
one thing.

Originally the widget-plugins used to detect whether widgets were
enabled and output the control form into the widget if they were, or
under Options-> if not.

Saying that, this adds a whole extra set of usability problems / bug
reports from people asking "I'm using the code, where do I configure
it?" because they've also got Widgets installed. Hence the reason I've
pulled all this code out of the plugins now!

As mentioned above this is the way I've gone about it, while also
moving the configuration options/etc. under Options->etc. to clear
things up.

I guess with this out the way there really is no reason to check
whether the current theme supports widgets or not.... so I'll stop
asking!

Thanks again for the all help,

Martin

It makes perfectly sense to have the options for a plugin two places.

The options you would put in you widget control is stuff like "How many of 
something something should be displayed?" and "Widget title".

Options for the plugin itself should go into "Options" or similar.

I think you would do yourself a favour by letting it go ;)

It would save the amount of code and easen the maintainence at a later point 
if (when) the widgets code change.

I'm currently using the following code in a theme.

<?php the_content('Continue reading "'. the_title("","",false).'"'); ?>

It outputs something like

blah blah blah content blah blah blah
<p><a href="linktomore">Continue reading</a></p>

Is there a way to avoid these paragraph tags and instead output
something similar to

blah blah blah content blah blah blah
<a href="linktomore">Continue reading</a>

Thanks,

I wrote this little bit of code to test for the case where the user
had sidebars but no active widgets in them (for somebody on trac,
actually):

function exist_active_widgets()
$sidebars_widgets = wp_get_sidebars_widgets();
foreach ($sidebars_widgets as $sidebar)
  if (!empty($sidebar)) return true;
return false;
}
if (!exist_active_widgets())
echo "User has no active widgets in any sidebar.";

The problem seems to be that:
a) You want to check if the theme is "widgets enabled" instead, and
b) You want to do this in a plugin.

Now, part A means that you want to know if the theme has registered
any sidebars. This is easy enough...
function is_theme_widget_enabled() {
global $wp_registered_sidebars;
if (count($wp_registered_sidebars) == 0) return false;
else return true;
}

The problem lies with part B. The theme registers sidebars in its
functions.php file, which is not loaded until well after the plugins
are loaded. So you have to delay whatever check you're talking about
until after that point. You can do this by hooking the init action
hook for onto whatever function you're using to do your initialization
and creation of your menu stuffs.

Message-ID: <6cfd47af0705311033m45d4a6bfl287aeed45e68df54@mail.gmail.com>

I'm developing a plugin which would allow you to define your widget
layout/options on a per page/post setting (as per TRAC ticket #4280),
and I thought I'd ask for feedback before I make any structural
decisions. What I'm thinking:


*Storage
New table, say wp_postext
Fields:
 post_id (BIGINT 20) primary index-> for storing which post this
setting belongs to
 widgets (TEXT) -> for storing which widgets are available, in a
serialized array (similar to active_plugins in wp_options)
 widget_options (TEXT) -> for storing options for the widget, in
serialized array

*Implementation Tasks
1)Modify how widgets saved (store to new table instead of to the
active_widgets option)
2)Modify how pages are loaded so that widgets are being read based on post_id
3)Modify edit/create pages to include widget layout section


What do people think? Any constructive comments/suggestions would be
appreciated.

Why don't you use the postmeta table instead of creating a new table?

To store into post_meta, we'd need one row for the active widgets and
their order. and a second row for the options of the widgets.
That means 2 integers and 2 meta_keys would have be added OVER what
would be required if we were using a new table.

Also, post_meta is used to store the custom values as well... not many
users would want to see two custom fields of serialzied arrays in
every post.

You won't be able to accurately do separate widget options anyway,
since each widget can store their own options anyway they like (in the
options table seems to be the best bet). So I'd give that a miss for
now and stick with widget arrangement, since that's the most requested
functionality (the ability to hide certain widgets on certain kinds of
pages).

And ugly custom fields are already used internally elsewhere for lots
of things. Look at _enclosure, for example. Use a key starting with an
underscore ("_sidebars_widgets_post" for preference), because the
underscore seems to be the standard for internal/automatic custom
field usage. A patch can be made to hide these underscore fields from
the interface if it's determined that that is a good idea.

So, yes, stick to a custom field in postmeta, for per post/page settings.

Also, use a fallback mechanism similar to the template hierarchy. If a
single post/page has no custom field for the widgets, fallback to the
one for all single pages (perhaps stored in the options table).
Failing that, fallback to the default widgets layout. Same for
archives and anything else. Store the "generic" layouts in the options
table, with names of "sidebars_widgets_archives" and
"sidebar_widgets_search" and such. The default is already there as
"sidebar_widgets".

Message-ID: <23C6037A-413C-4E28-9277-716ADBBD5327@googlemail.com>

As I promised I'd write ages ago, here's a list of issues with  
WordPress (though I accidentally sent this from my main email address  
and it got caught in the moderation queue yesterday, so here it is  
from the proper address (which, as it is subscribed, should read all  
of you)):

1. People have been asking for an XML serialiser to be used for all  
the XML WordPress produces for years. This doesn't exist. This allows  
invalid bytes to get into XML data. Try parsing <http://photomatt.net/ 
comments/feed/atom/> with a compliant XML parser. You'll get a fatal  
error. This is the exact sort of issue that an XML serialiser would  
avoid.

2. Having waited years for an Atom 1.0 feed to be offered:
	a) We eventually get one that allows malformed XML to be inserted  
(see 1. above).
	b) Uses RFC 822 dates (what part of section 3.3 of RFC 4287[RFC4287]  
is unclear?).
	c) Uses @content for <link> (where did that come from? There's no  
@content in the entire spec! Please see @href, section 4.2.7.1 
[RFC4287].).
	d) Claims that the blog title is a MIME type, and when the feed is  
meant to link to itself it links to the RSS 2.0 feed (what's unclear  
in section 4.2.7.2 of RFC 4287[RFC4287]?).

Those four issues are just from a quick glance at the above mentioned  
feed. Seeming so many of these things are CLEARLY wrong, it looks as  
if the person who implemented it had NEVER read the Atom 1.0 spec,  
RFC 4287[RFC4287].

3. Why was no Atom 1.0 feed offered?
	a) "Aggregators I tried with the existing patch didn't  
work."[TICKET1526] ? We already offer multiple feeds to make sure  
the UA can parse one (though in the above case, all of Photo Matt's  
comment feeds are currently broken, and any parser that parses it is  
broken).
	b) "There is no satisfactory patch available."[TICKET1526] ?  
Waiting doesn't seem to have made this much better than patches that  
were around several years ago, see 2.
	c) "We have no way currently to ensure XHTML validity."[TICKET1526]  
? See 1.

4. When will the above (see 2) issues be resolved?
	a) There was a bug I reported around six months ago in the Atom 0.3  
feed[TICKET3377], which still hasn't been fixed in WordPress 2.0.x,  
despite the fact it makes the feed totally unusable in some  
aggregators (Firefox 2.0 included).
	b) This bug had been in WordPress for several years, yet remained  
unfixed, despite the fact that a visit to the feed validator 
[FEEDVALIDATOR] would have clearly pointed it out.
	c) Matt failed to read the report: "Since our feeds currently work  
everywhere, I'm not inclined to change this."[TICKET3377] (the bug  
report explicitly cites Firefox 2.0 as breaking). Is it really too  
much to ask to actually read a bug report before closing as wontfix?

5. WordPress has no guarantee that the XHTML it outputs is well- 
formed OR valid.
	a) Us, as implementers, are allowed to parse XHTML (even when served  
as text/html) as XML, so WordPress will fail horribly.
	b) There is no method to switch WordPress to output HTML (so we  
don't expose users to fatal errors), and this can't be done at a  
theme level as in places empty tags are closed within WordPress's  
source. We can't change this without using an XML parser on  
WordPress's output, but as there is no guarantee it's well-formed,  
this doesn't help.

6. WordPress claims that it has "a focus on aesthetics, web  
standards, and usability."[WORDPRESS]
	a) If you focus on web standards, why is that very page served as  
text/html while having an XHTML 1.1 DOCTYPE? This SHOULD NOT[RFC2119]  
be done under advice from the old HTML WG[XHTMLMIME]. Can you please  
cite your reasons in this "particular behavior is acceptable or even  
useful"[RFC2119] (from the normative definition of SHOULD NOT).
	b) WordPress by default uses a DOCTYPE that exists for transiting to  
standards. If you have a focus on web standards, why is this  
transition still going on after many years?
	c) WordPress uses XHTML served as text/html, which MAY be done. Why  
does this (the blogosphere) "particular marketplace requires it or  
because the vendor feels that it enhances the product"[RFC2119] (from  
the normative definition of MAY)?

7. WordPress has on several occasions avoided changing libraries  
(sometimes to the extent of just not updating them) on grounds on  
backwards compatibility.
	a) We're moving from script.aculo.us to JQuery, but keeping JQuery  
around for plugins/themes that need it. Why can we not have multiple  
versions of other libraries (or different libraries that do the same  
thing)?
	b) Better yet, why don't we just have an abstraction layer, so the  
library is never called directly (and therefore can be swapped  
without breaking anything)?

8. There are other bugs that do in many places cause large issues,  
including but not limited to:
	a) IRIs as comment links get stripped (e.g., James Holderness,  
<http://www.???.com/>, posted a comment on my blog. The IRI was  
rewritten to <http://www..com/>.).
	b) <blockquote> elements cannot be nested within one another 
[TICKET1170]. This is marked as closed, although I just recreated it  
on both 2.2 and 2.3. This bug has been opened for over _TWO YEARS  
WITH PATCHES AVAILABLE_!

9. There have been several occasions on which Matt has overruled  
consensus, sometimes giving a reason like "I misunderstood" (does  
that mean _EVERYONE_ misunderstood, or just you, Matt?).

10. Matt has claimed that the development process isn't broken  
because everything gets replied to. I'll continue waiting, then 
[HACKERS12601]. Oh, and see if anyone replies to this.

11. WordPress tries to improve the quality of releases by moving onto  
120 day releases[HACKERS8907], yet proceeds to break it with the  
first release on the cycle[CHANGESET5110] (or does tagging not count  
as "crazy wild fun development"?).

In summary, I'd advice those working on WordPress to read the follow

here's something (slightly) less serious:
	"This specification should be read like all other specifications.

Ouch, bite the hand that feeds you -- in this case maybe even your own hand.

I guess you are saying that Sam Ruby has not read the spec either then.
http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/24/WordPress-and-Atom-1-0

Anyway, what is really at issue here is that we all make mistakes,
lets learn from them, and correct them as we have the opportunity to.

I am happy to file the bugs for the issues you identify here, but if
you are able to that would be even better because you have a *much*
better comprehension of the issues.

All the best,

There's reasons for everytime I say anything negative about Matt,  
always related to the current subject matter. I think they're all  
explicitly mentioned, too.

How do you suggest I summarise that entire post in one line? It  
covers too many subjects.

Actually, for some reason, the site feed and the comments feed share  
very little common code, so Sam Ruby has absolutely nothing to do  
with the comments feed. The site feed is fine. It does however appear  
to be fixed in trunk, though (I'd looked at the log of the site feed  
in SVN, assuming that you wouldn't have such code repeated, but it  
appears otherwise, meaning there are two places to have bugs, not one).

? and the ticket has been closed _AGAIN_. Just because you can't  
reproduce a bug doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I've just recreated it  
again. It most certainly exists here. It should really be the person  
claiming the bug exists who closes it when it's fixed, not someone else.

That has a lot of information -- and I don't have the expertise to
follow it. Maybe, a new suscinct ticket would move the issue forward?
Of course, patches and availability to discuss on #wordpress-dev helps
even more!

Would you please respond with how to reproduce it then?

Is this an isolated issue?

Most often in every large project I have contributed to, reporters do
not follow up on the tickets they have opened, so that would not be
good approach.

Luc Bizeul is doing a Google Summer of Code test automation for
WordPress project for editor formatting.

Oh, I am following you now! I missed the comment part of the link to
photomatt's site, and you do not explicitly mention comment feed in
the first part of your email.

Perhaps if you had broken it into multiple posts, each with a dedicated
subject?  It would appear as less of a meandering rant, and would allow each
issue to get the focus it deserves.

This makes sense. With that said, I'm running into a few issues.

The problem creating a plugin to extend the widget functionality is
that there's no hooks for the widgets. To be able to save the
sidebars/widgets to another location, I would need to change the code
in widget.php; unless there's something I'm missing.

The SBM plugin was a replacement for the WP Widgets. But since Widgets
are in WP 2.2+ core, you can't replace them anymore.

Thanks! I was just getting ready to search for that ticket. It still exists
in 2.2. Basically if you have a post that contains nested quotes it will
remove the nesting once it runs through balanceTags. For example this:

--------
Hey Now

<blockquote>Your
<blockquote>An</blockquote>
All</blockquote>
Star
--------

Running through balanceTags changes to this:

--------
<p>Hey Now</p>
<blockquote><p>Your</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>An</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All</p>
<p>Star</p>
--------

I manually applied the patch attached to the ticket to 2.2 and it did fix
it. 

The problem occurs when saving a post with "WordPress should correct
invalidly nested XHTML automatically" checked. Since the content goes
through the balanceTags filter on content_save_pre it only applies at
save/publish time.

I'm not entirely certain how you're envisioning the interface here, so
I cannot say how to do it the way you want to do it. The consensus on
trac seemed to be that most people disliked hated the user interface
of SBM, because it made you configure the widgets to show up in
certain places instead of configuring the places to show certain
widgets, if that makes any sense.

I would expect that you would extend the Post/Page editing screen to
allow you to reposition/change widgets there. As well as create
someplace where you can do the same for various other types of things
(search, archives, etc).

Where you need extra hooks and such (to determine what widgets to
show, of course), my suggestion is to go ahead and add those hooks and
then submit the changes to the core code as a patch. Heck, if it's
good, I'd not make it a plugin at all, but submit a patch and get it
in the core. The user interface is the key issue here.

How would that help this issue? It was _finally_ fixed in 2.2, when  
Atom 1.0 support was added at the site level (the shipped comments  
feed is unusable, so it isn't really added, IMO). This is, along with  
various other points, an issue with WP's development process.

Sorry, I don't understand. As well as development process concerns,
does 3. describe any current technical issues?

I've done so. I assumed WP would have balanceTags enabled by default  
due to its "focus on web standards", but once again WP's emphasis on  
standards obviously isn't as strong as the website suggests (as  
surely ensuring valid XHTML should be done, as the option name says  
it does?).

Well, seeming I'd said I was going to write such a post several times  
in IRC, including once to Matt, who told me to do so, I saw no reason  
to.

The third comment relates to using the XHTML content construct in  
Atom, which requires the XHTML to be well-formed XML. We have no  
method of ensuring that (the only way to properly do so is to either  
reject anything at an authoring level that isn't well formed, or use  
an XML serialiser). What was eventually done was using the HTML  
content construct, and relying on HTML error handling (so that empty  
tags aren't treated as NETs).

It's also rather odd that Matt is saying that, as we didn't use the  
the XML construct in Atom 0.3, but rather we used the HTML one. Why  
must we use the XHTML one in Atom 1.0, and not continue doing what  
we're already doing?

Not by a long way.

Well, should a bug really be marked as fixed without anything being  
changed, when the report says the bug still exists?

I don't see that the bug was ever marked fixed. It was marked as
worksforme by two smart, dedicated people -- it happens.

I find the problem too.
Some of my posts will not return the correct slug URL in atom output,like

<id>http://www.owind.com/pub/computer/wordpress/2007/05/28/%e4%b8%bawordpress%e6%8a%95%e4%b8%8a%e4%b8%80%e7%a5%a8/</id>

but some of posts return the slug URL correctly.

My atom feed http://www.owind.com/pub/feed/atom/ will fail of validation of W3 feed valid 'cause the wrong slug URLs.
