Message-ID: <4367E048.40706@skippy.net>

[ cross-posted to all pertinent WP lists ]

We've selected Saturday, November 5 as the date for our WordPress Bug Hunt:
http://www.skippy.net/blog/2005/11/01/wordpress-bug-hunt-2005-11-05/

I'd appreciate it if someone could compose a quick forum post about
this, and also throw mention of it onto the Codex.  I tried, but decided
that I couldn't get the proper "tone" for such an announcement on the Codex.

Maybe just a page similar to the IRC Meetup page.

We can put a notice on the dev blog.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Needed: WP Development On Windows Cheat Sheet
Message-ID: <436954B1.7030307@skippy.net>

In preparation for the Bug Hunt on Saturday, I'd like to see a "cheat
sheet" to help people become familiar with development processes.

Mark has written a quick OSX / Linux cheat sheet:
http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2005/11/02/my-wordpress-toolbox/

I'd like to see something like this for Windows.  I assume most
reasonable people use TortoiseSVN?  Can someone compose a quick guide?
I don't even know how one applies a patch on Windows...

Thanks!

Note that Mark's instructions are exactly the same on Windows if you're 
connecting to a remote server via SSH using something like Putty or 
XShell to replace his very first command (ssh).

(XShell is pretty nice, by the way, if you're in the market for a 
commercial Windows SSH client.  http://www.netsarang.com)

Subject: [wp-hackers] New Feature: get_categories function
Message-ID: <436A9EC2.9070705@integralsource.com>

Hi,

I posted this on the support forum tonight, where it
was recommended to post it here so you guys get to
read it.

I have an archive dropdown working as follows:

<select onchange="if (this.selectedIndex != 0) { window.location = 
this[this.selectedIndex].value; }">
   <option>Choose Month...</option>
   <?php get_archives('monthly','','option'); ?>
</select>

I think a category dropdown that works in a similar fashion would be 
great e.g. get_categories('format', 'name', 'before', 'after'); ?>

<select onchange="if (this.selectedIndex != 0) { window.location = 
this[this.selectedIndex].value; }">
   <option>Choose Category...</option>
   <?php get_categories('option', 'name'); ?>
</select>

Of course this is not possible at the moment using the dropdown_cats 
function as it creates the <select>, therefore preventing me from adding 
the onchange attribute. It also sets the value attribute of each option 
to it's index rather than the category URL which is required for 
changing the window.location.

Has this type of functionality been considered before?

Thanks,
-John K

Putting aside the fact that "madness" is an overstatement to describe what
I  see above, it is a matter of which distribution you happen to be using.
It  varies depending on which fonts you happen to have installed. I agree,
however,  that  font sets can always be made more generous. Have  you  in-
stalled  any  TrueType fonts packages yet? If not, you are likely  to  see
more of the same in other Web sites.

I have just tried Ubuntu (GNOME) on a remote host, just as a proof of con-
cept.  It all looked fine to me, i.e. no low-resultion fonts. Catering for
each individual distro (they come with different fonts) is hard. The least
you  can  do is download more packages of font. There are no less  for  20
such  packages  in SuSE 9.3. The Microsoft(R) TTF package seems  to  cover
most circumstances.

Hope it helps,

Roy

text fields and buttons.

Long (and rude because of know-all attitude):

Standard fonts are distributed with X.org.

Not if you test with the standard fonts of the most common
operating systems instead of assuming that the entire world uses
Microsoft's fonts.

No need to, the standard ones are both excellent and plenty.

No, the rest of the web looks great, just like it has done for the
past six years. But of course the rest of the web isn't doing this:

	<style type="text/css">
	#log, #pwd, #submit {
		font-size: 1.7em;
	}
	</style>

Ubuntu isn't a standard.

It must be really hard to be a web developer with all those evil Linux
distributions. Oh boy am I glad you are willing to share your deep
insight with me. But please don't mind doing so in the future.

This is silly.

If your objection was that you don't like the large font-size, that's
cool. It's not an accident. I suggest rephrasing this entire
conversation as:

"I don't like the large text on the buttons."

To which the reply will be:

"Ok."

I thought it was an accident. Actually I still believe it is, as I'm
sure the buttons are supposed to fit inside the layout:

But if it isn't, then that's cool too :-) I'd like to hear it from
someone actually involved in the project, though.

Your manners need to improve, I'm afraid. Throughout this conversion it 
has only
been you who chose to be rude; you do not even deny it. You do us no 
justice by
re-humanising that "Linux fanatic" stereotype.

Thanks. It was never a complaint, by the way. Vocal ambiguity perhaps.

Correct.

Not many (if any) of the developers are Windows-oriented and/or
Windows-inclined, so that statement is a bit unfair. Not every time layouts
breaks, should Windows be blamed either.

You can never educate an entire world of Web developer. As long as pages with
preferred fonts prevail, there is the need to adapt. Rants lead nowhere.

How mature. Your later reply (below) shows that your resement is not 
directed at
me, but merely at anyone. Your choice was to be hostile from the moment you
typed in the subject line.

Okay, pair enough. Then again, I guess it is not crucial as setup is not
visitor-facing.

See, and here I thought you were complaining about the fact the smaller 
fonts are pixellated and not anti-aliased!  I guess I'm used to seeing 
interfaces that don't fit, especially em-based ones, given that em-size 
changes based on your settings in your browser.  It's for that reason that I 
myself moved my site back to fixed pixel sizes, which hurts usability at one 
level but gives me design control.

I would agree that it was likely purposeful.  However, it may very well be 
that the font being mapped to on your box has a base em size larger than 
whatever was tested with, as well as possibly a larger character spacing 
too.  Could also be that the Gnome browser is mapping a different (larger) 
base font size, don't know.

I would guess it could be tweaked to be say 1.5em so that it fits on your 
box, assuming your box is in some way a good 'reference' point to base off 
of.  But I don't have a clean install I can 'reset' here at the moment --  
anyone want to snapshot a windows-based screen (or Graeme can snap a linux 
screen) that 'seems to look right'?

Gnome has nothing to do with the fonts used, X11 (XFree86/Xorg) does. While
I'm not sure what distribution you're running, gentoo-wiki (
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Xorg_and_Fonts) has a great guide (again,
Gentoo-specific) that makes the fonts look cleaner, more proportional, and
more like you would be used to if you were using Windows XP (with ClearType
enabled).

Troll often?

The point he was trying to make that with a properly configured linux box,
your fonts will look just fine. I use Gentoo on my home PC, and with some
work I was able to make the fonts look almost identical to their windows
counterparts.

The entire point of reporting this problem is that it shouldn't be
necessary to "do some work" (whatever that means) to make the WordPress
login/setup look decent on a stock X11 desktop.

Thanks for understanding this issue and help fix it! As I can't reject
that it could be an issue on my box, I'd like that too. I'm using 9pt
Luxi Sans for GTK apps whereas the default is 10pt Sans (which on a box
without Microsoft's fonts installed would be Bitstream Vera Sans.)

The address linked to in the most recent checking (number 3009) is

Based off the code, well, I guess I can't accurately discern what 
exactly it is.

Could someone give a summary of it's purpose (for use until the site

"xml-rpc for php is used in a large number of popular web applications
such as PostNuke, Drupal, b2evolution, Xoops, WordPress, PHPGroupWare
and TikiWiki. When exploited, this could compromise a vulnerable system.
Most of these packages should have xml-rpc for php vulnerability fixed

I'm assuming it's fixed, but confirmation ahead of any forum posts would
be nice.

WordPress doesn't use the same XMLRPC library as most other PHP
applications, so we're generally not affected by the same problems.

The simplest way to think of it is that it's autodiscovery for 
third-party editors: just like you can tell your RSS aggregator the URL 
for the front page of a weblog and have it find the feed, RSD lets you 
tell a desktop weblog editor the URL for your weblog, and it finds the 
path to /xmlrpc.php.

At least in theory: I suspect that saying the charset of the RSD file is 
the weblog's charset when in fact it's US-ASCII might be an interop problem.

Buried at the bottom of the page is a link to the Security Focus 
solutions page saying that it's an attack on the vulnerability that WP 
1.5.1.3 fixed.

Just for future information, both of those pages are terribly
inaccurate. WordPress does not suffer from the vulnerability
described, but an XML-RPC vulerability was published for WordPress at
the same time, which led to a huge misunderstanding.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Object Cache API and Persistent Object Caching
Message-ID: <1131401828.17464.117.camel@portnoy.fuzzybelly.org>

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3011

This introduces a new object cache API.  You can see the implementation
in the cache.php file.

http://trac.wordpress.org/file/trunk/wp-includes/cache.php

The API is very similar to memcached.  It's basically just a set/get
API.

http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.memcache.php

Since the entire implementation is pluggable, you could even use
memcache on the backend if you like.  If a wp-content/object-cache.php
file is present, that file is loaded instead of wp-includes/cache.php.

The default implementation introduces a WP_Object_Cache class that
handles writing objects out to disk and loading them into memory upon
request.  wp-content must be writable for this to work.  If it is not
writable, we fall back to the old way of populating the cache with big
SELECT * calls on every page load.  Currently, the persistent cache is
disabled by default.  If you would like to help test, go into
wp-settings.php and comment out the DISABLE_CACHE line.  I've attached a
dump_queries.php plugin that will dump query and cache stats into the
footer for debug/diagnostic purposes.

Categories, options, users, and pages are cached.  My tests with Apache
Bench show a few percent performance increase on my testbeds.  We need
some tests on busy shared hosts with lots of disk activity going on to
see how it handles.

Cache expiration, cache file deletion upon object delete, and some other
small items remain to be done.  And I think we'll need finer grained
locking on the cache.  Perhaps one lock for the global groups and one
for the per blog groups.  Right now we have one big lock, which will be
problematic with WPMU most likely.

Take a look, kick the tires, and give feedback and patches.  If anyone
wants to take a shot at a memcached version, I'll gladly help out.  I'm
interested in comparing numbers between different implementations.

Ryan,
Is there some speed advantage to this?

Each of the ID columns used to select is a primary key, there can only
ever be one row returned by definition.

I wouldn't recommend doing this because, it's not very standards compliant.
Nor is it very accessible other than to sighted mouse users.

I never thought of that.  This is definitely an area of web

We had limit 1 on a couple of selects I replaced.

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3013

I remember these being added to fix a performance bug a couple folks
reported, so I just added the limits to our get methods.  I don't know
if they make any difference.

Sounds neat -- I'll be interested to test it out once I'm finished porting 
CHAITGEAR to 1.5.x (almost done!)... I have my own database 'layer' that 
used to sit in front of the db object, and provided debug logging of all 
queries, plus the ability to specify a cache-name for a given query and have 
it cached to disk.  I did it the simple way, with an N hour 
expiration/refresh of the cache -- obviously, that might be a bit wasteful, 
but meant I don't worry about hooking all over (WP) creation! ;)

Looking forward to checking it out.. I assume it's completely orthogonal to 
staticize/wp-cache, right?

This is correct.

WordPress has not used the PHPXMLRPC (AKA Useful, Inc) libraries since 
the release of version 1.5. Any vulnerabilities in those libraries does 
not affect current versions of WordPress.

As mentioned before, there *was* a *completely different* vulnerability 
related to XML-RPC which *did* affect WP not too long ago. We addressed 
that problem in version 1.5.1.3

So, to reiterate, the advisories about this current worm which mention 
WordPress 1.5.x as being vulnerable are *incorrect*.

great stuff. just from initial clicking-around testing i'm seeing a 50% 
reduction in queries per page.

initial questions that come to mind (and this is before looking at the 
code closely): is there now or in the future going to be file locking? 
won't php processes then be in contention for the same files? isn't this 
the sort of thing that databases are good at but php filesystem functions 
are not?

(i'm sure this has been thought of, just thowing that out to start some 
discussion :)

Yes.  Doing it in the filesystem means you have to handle stuff the DB
takes care of.

We currently grab a semaphore if the sem functions are available
otherwise we flock().  We may need to drop the semaphore stuff and just
flock.  I'm not sure if the process context of sems is broad enough.

Yes.  wp-cache and friends cache entire pages rather than individual
objects.  Since a single post can show up in many different places due
to WP's dynamic nature, lots of pages need to be cached.  The object
cache takes the approach of caching just the objects to help speed up
dynamic page rendering.

I added your key salting and also created empty index.php files in the
cache dirs to prevent directory listings.

I've been hearing of and seeing some problems with mod_rewrite
permalinks and the new object caching code. I haven't gotten a chance
to look too far into where this might be coming from yet, but its
something to keep your eyes open for.

For added measure, let's give the cache files .php extensions and wrap
the serialized object in some php tags and a comment block.  We'll strip
those out before unserializing the object.

Yay Matt!

This cache thing is pretty smooth.  I haven't seen any weirdness with 
the Pretty Permalinks yet, but I'm still watching.

Is there likely to be a disk space issue as the cache increases in size? 
  For example, can we assume a certain size cache based on the database 
size if Google crawls the entire site?  And how will that affect admins 
with small-space hosts?  I suppose you could keep the cache off...

Right now we're caching a fairly limited subset of things, so it would 
be unlikely that something like Google crawling your site would increase 
the disk space at all. Posts and comments will probably always by 
primarily in the DB, except maybe for the front page.

(It would also be interesting to have a stats plugin kick a single post 
into "cached" mode if it gets a burst of traffic or something. We would 
need a garbage cleaner so these sorts of caches wouldn't stick around 
forever.)

Ah, yes, I see this now.  I had thought "posts" when I read "pages". 
Good enough.

Allow me to edit your comment a bit:

"It would also be interesting to have a stats plugin."

I also agree with your original thesis.

On third thought, possibly not. How many people are publishing from 
WordPress in things like GB2312 that will make non-Chinese XML parsers 
choke on the RSD? And what are the odds of not getting mojibake if you 
try to push GB2312 through XML-RPC, anyway?

MT has been doing RSD since February 2003 with no charset specified at 
all, despite being big in Japan; no matter what the weblog charset, you 
have nothing but US-ASCII/UTF-8 in the RSD; every XML parser will 
properly parse it if you declare it as UTF-8 or don't declare a charset 
at all; for other declared charsets, some XML parsers (possibly 
including the one that makes them think their RSS works) will accept it 
and some will refuse it; beyond that I don't really know.

Would be nice if the functionality similar to the PostLevels plug-in was
integrated into Wordpress.

PostLevels is a Wordpress plugin which allows you to restrict access to
posts based upon the user level.  It's quite handy for webjournals.

The current plugin is broken due to limitations in Wordpress.  Private posts
don't show up in Archive and Category Post listings.

I think we should revert 3020 (inclusion of accesskeys in tinymce).

Access keys are a great idea but have flawed implementations in all
browsers, which make using pages with them impossibly annoying. A
quick example: when I now go onto my Write Post screen and hit Alt-D
to select the URL bar (perhaps to navigate to another page), all I get
is the strikethrough button lighting up.

I won't talk much about this as there has been extensive discussion in
the past. See the following articles:

Giving up accesskeys *altogether* would probably be a poor move. They make
Web interfaces as productive as native desktop software. It is possible to
select  accesskeys that prevent a large number of key collisions/conflicts
(or mouse gestures collision as I recently experienced).

In  the case of Web browsers, the numbers (digits) appear to be valueable,
especially if you align the corresponding buttons horizontally. The choice
of  alt+D was probably not a wise one, particularly because it is accommo-
dated  by  a very fundamental function in a ubiquitous browser. You  could
never  avoid  all conflicts because there are global shortcuts  too  (e.g.
XMMS,  AmaroK). The best you can ever do is try a variety of browsers  and
check  the  default  key mappings. Imagine yourself  assigning  CTRL+W  to
tinymce,  which  is by convention "close tab" and may have someone kill  a
textarea  in the midst of writing an item. It is tempting to choose short-
cuts  that make good mnemonics of the word they correspond to, but  colli-
sions  should be the prime consideration, as well as the distance  between
keys. ALT1..7 appear to be 'safe'.

'nuff  sed'  as  I imagine that similar opinions have been voiced  in  the
past.

Roy

Just try pressing ALT1-7 in Firefox when you have a couple of tabs open.. :)

I never use access keys myself either, and when I hit ctrl-a to select 
all and instead get a url pop-up that's annoying.

The browser needs some way of "capturing" special keystrokes when a 
textarea is selected, the users eyes are looking at the textarea, or 
some other magic way of knowing what the user wanted to do! heh.

Oops.  I  have used these shortcuts for almost a year, but I get  ALT  and
CTRL mixed up sometimes. I wound up using ALT8-10 in my portal due to *ex-
actly* that issue.

How   about  a  user-configurable  set  of  shortcuts?  PHP   can   handle
accesskey="<KEY>"  on the fly. In fact, last year I conceived a project of
dynamically  assigning shortcuts and underlining letters in all Web pages.
I still have it among my list of ideas.

Would  user-configurable  (or  changeable) shortcuts ruin a  globality  or
break  some conventions? It would only affect WordPress after all.  Short-
cuts will be preserved when the Webmaster moves from one machine to anoth-
er  as the settings will be in the installation (/database). I think  that
enabling  the  users  to at least change default accelerators would  be  a
valuable  thing.  Imagine yourself users switching off keyboard  shortcuts
altogether because of one critical collision...

Forgive me for not quoting everyone. The gist is this: I hate mousing
the toolbar and I think you do, too. Hotkeys of one kind or another
are just necessary. Accesskey is the easiest and lightest way to go
but we must keep an eye out for key collision and user annoyance.

This can be done by adding our own key-related event handlers to the
ones already implemented in TinyMCE. It's several times harder to code
but it's the most flexible method.

It would be far easier to enable the existing accesskeys on editor
focus and disable them on blur.

> How   about  a  user-configurable  set  of  shortcuts?
> Roy

No. We do it right or not at all, IMO.

I think the best accesskeys are the ones already in TinyMCE core.
There are only three and they simply focus on the three parts of the
editor box. Our accesskeys do sometimes collide with browser shortcut
keys. I am to blame for not knowing my own browser's shortcut keys!
Also, I learned that Alt+p was already assigned to our Publish button.
How about that? :-)

Now, let's collect some solutions in one place:
* Disable the accesskeys while the editor is blurred. Actually not
that hard to do.
* Use only upper-case accesskeys. Takes ten seconds to patch. Are
there any collisions with Alt+Shift+<letter>?
* Revert accesskeys and write JS to capture Ctrl+<letter> only within
the editor. By far the most work to implement. Would there still be
any important key collisions?
* Develop a "safe" set of accesskeys with zero or very few important collisions.
* Code support and UI for custom accesskeys or JS-captured keys.

Everyone concerned, please weigh in.

My vote would go for a combination of the first two options, disable
the accesskeys when the editor is blurred and make them upper-case,
I'm not aware of any existing ALT+SHIFT+<letter> shortcuts and a quick
google didn't reveal any although interestingly it brought up Nestle's
website (www.nestle.com) that uses ALT+SHIFT+<number> for menu
navigation so it could already be some sort of defact standard to
avoid collisions.

It's both the least difficult and the option I like best.  Fancy that.

I disagree with this statement. Unless I am mistaking, most people who
actually use keyboard short cuts are fluent with computer programming. I
meet highly educated people everyday who have 10+ years of experience using
Word and Excel who have no clue how to copy, cut and paste using the
keyboard.

Also, I personally find using Alt quite unnatural, when compared to Ctrl.
Habit and the (un-)learning curve that comes as a result arguably are one of
the reasons. More importantly however, the Alt key is not as conveniently
located on the keyboard: Ctrl+X, Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Z all get pinky hits; their
Alt+ counterparts do not. Alt+Shift combos do not either.

Denis,
You and others are missing the REAL point of access keys. They are for
people who are using assistive technologies. For example, people who
have shaky hands and cannot use a mouse very precisely. It is a big
help to them if the tab order works correctly and they can use access
keys to move around the various controls or just sections of the page.
It is also important for people who cannot see the screen to be able
to move around the page in a logical and convenient way. They cannot
scan the page and click on the item they want to deal with.  They need
to be able to jump around with the keyboard and tab from control to
control.

I can't see the correlation. Persistence of use, not necessarily in a pro-
grammatic  context,  gives the motivation to favour keystrokes.  Have  you
seen travel agents and how they handle these repeatable queries? *grin*

I'd suggest a couple of possibilities:

*  Teachers or trainers should take the blame. I have seen people  copying
and pasting data using the context menus or, at worst, the main menu. This
reduces  productivity enormously if all you do is manage a spreadsheet  by
moving  elements  around and cannot drag-and-drop. In X11, you  need  only
highlight and use button2, so no need for the keyboard at all.

* (gross generalisation) People using Word and Excel have littler curiosi-
ty.  They  are less willing to *explore* a program, which refers  to  your
point above.

I  agree with you on that, but ALT (jointly with the mouse buttons) can be
used very heavily to control window position and scale. It has few reasons
to  be left untouched. CTRL+SHIFT combinations are becoming common. I have
collisions  with these (Thunderbird and XMMS). AmaroK goes as far as using
the Windows logo button.

These are also helpful when the mouse or motherboard go faulty. Many years
back  I was forced to tab my way around and realised that certain interac-
tions  were  not  designed properly. For example, to get  to  the  Windows
taskbar, a user needs to press the Windows logo, hit ESC, then TAB twice.

I thought about it before, but it requires JavaScript. Then again, TinyMCE
has JavaScript as a fundamental pre-requisite.

You  can never satisfy everyone. Choose keys that lead to 0 collisions and
users  will whine that they need to use two hands (e.g. CTRL+P) while bet-
ter  shortcuts  are available on their platform/browser. Choose keys  that
are  a  decent  compromise and signals will get devoured. Minutes  can  be
spent  trying to figure out why a certain function does not work. Finally,
it  turns  out that it is overridden by something obscure that  has  never
been used before and isn't conspicuous either.

I suppose you are right. Yet another set of options leads to confusion.

Rarely.  None  that I am aware of, but if WayV was configured  in  certain
ways,  things  could go awry. If you chose that combination, you  probably
could not go right of the 'R', 'F' and 'V' on QWERTY.

Nestle always have to be different. They actually patented coffee beer re-

This was already fixed in changeset 3048, and it would be a bit more
appreciated if you'd make sure you're running the latest revision or
you at least scroll the bug list for duplicate bugs.

The options and cache systems are undergoing heavy overhaul at the

Just to clear this up so the poor chap doesn't get confused... the 
ticket states that it was resolved in 3028 and not 3048. 3048 has 
nothing to do with adding/updating options.

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3028

If they did redevelop after 3028 it looks like they've been fixed 
(again) in 3052... http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3052

In regards to adding features without testing, yes, this is still ALPHA 
software in testing. Things get added, then people check to see if it 
breaks anything. This isn't a "stable" tree that you're running from.

Next time when reporting a bug and you're using an unstable version, 
make sure to note the latest changeset you have so people can figure out 
if its been fixed or if it needs to be fixed.

Criteria to keep in mind:

* Size (smaller the better)

* Popularity

I'd definately put a vote in on any decent spam fighting plugin, bad
behavior being my plugin of choice (the actual size for WordPress can
be cut down from the full download size, we don't need support files
for * CMS).

Jalenack's edit comments plugin, although I really think this would be
a great core feature with an option (*ducks).

I'll think of a few more later

A spam fighting plugin should definitely be one of the 2 or 3. I will leave
the fighting as to which plugin for the rest of the list. :)

Will ponder the other possibilities..

Spam Fighting certainly.
Maybe in the form of SK2, Bad Behavior, maybe Akismet.
Each one has their pros and cons to go into a default install though...
SK2 is like a swiss army knife which is great for the power user but 
overwhelming to the newbie...
Bad Behavior is silent and deadly to all spammers but without an 
interface, definitely bad for newbies.
And Akismet... depending on how keys are distributed in the future... It 
seems a little convoluted to ask people to get Flock to then get a 
WP.Com blog to get the key to put into the original WP install.
My money and time would go towards Bad Behavior with a light front end 
to manage the whitelist.

Editor Search
http://www.theoneandtheonly.com/wordpress-editor-search/
Makes finding code in the theme/plugin editor much much easier.

Enhanced Post Listing is functionality that should be baked in to 
WordPress IMHO.

Edit Comments is also hot. it gets a +1

Actually, I think this is all the better for newbies, less clutter,
set it and forget it.

I agree that set-and-forget is great at first but when something goes 
wrong, you have to diagnose it by messing with the database directly and 
then have to edit files to set the configuration options.
In the grand scheme of things, a little information and configuration 
screen isn't much to ask.

Isn't that a bit problematic when you want to change it?

I nominate the Blogs of the Day plugin. Its small, the code is pretty much 
final and stability has been rock solid even during beta testing. As for 
popularity, there are currently 1347 sites running it and that number grows 
steadily. I have no idea how that compares to other plugins, however. It 
also was a winner of one of the prizes in the Wordpress Plugin Competition.

I have a few plugins that I consider absolutely essential, but I tend to
think that they are things that should be part of the main application,
rather than actual additional add-ons.

I'm thinking of things like Time Zone (real TZ functionality), Preview
Post (which is now in 1.6) and Fancy Excerpt (because WP's default
excerpts are rubbish).

So actually, that's not really an answer at all.

As a more general comment, I think that the choices should be reflect
functionality that is definitely optional, but encourages (rather than
enforces) what WP backs as best-practice. So, I agree with everyone who
has recommended at least one anti-spam plugin. Other things that may
fall in this category are things like Google Sitemaps and other
SEO-targeted plugins, Technorati/del.icio.us/whatever blogosphere
integration plugins, and maybe a detailed statistics plugin.

We're doing two things: showing off the power of plugins (which, to be
frank, Hello, Dolly really doesn't) and introducing new technologies (we
 should be aiming for a "wow, I dind't know blogs could do that!").

There are a number of plugins who literally fix WordPress and who should be
considered for the WordPress core imho, e.g.:

Check IP Behind Proxy
Paged Comment Editing
Enhanced Post List
FixBack
Impostercide
No Ping Wait
Smart Update Pinger
Twilight AutoSave
Site Unavailable
Permalink Redirect
Fancy Excerpt

Once that part is done, you'll likely want things like

A spam plugin, e.g. Bad Behavior, Hashcash
An ego plugin, e.g. Blogs of the day
A caching plugin, e.g. wp-cache

No Ping Wait is defunct, the exact fix that I used was integrated into
1.5.2, an even better fix into 1.6.

I disagree with the suggestions for spam plugin bundling.  Why?

Spam Karma - Even if the default settings work well, the moment you need 
to configure anything you wade into a quagmire of UI that both isn't 
easy and doesn't look anything like the rest of WordPress.  This is too 
difficult to configure for beginning users.

Bad Behavior - Maybe the next version will suit me, but I think it's a 
major failing that it doesn't have any easy way for a user (visitor or 
admin) to deal with the problem of what to do when they're incorrectly 
blocked.  The logic that it uses to prevent spam works right now, but 
packing it with WordPress will only make the spammers write work-arounds 
faster.  It's also a bazillion files.

Akismet - As already mentioned; download Flock, sign up for a 
WordPress.com account that wouldn't be used, find the API key, insert 
the API key into the plugin.  If the plugin was modified to let you 
create new WP.com accounts on the fly, then maybe that would work, but 
it's still not exactly "set it and forget it".  Plus, the "high-earning 
blogs should pay" aspect of it being added to free software gives me the 
willies.

I don't think anyone has written a spam prevention plugin that addresses 
the needs of users who wouldn't think of reading this mailing list.  And 
I don't think that choosing a specific spam prevention solution is 
something we should do for everyone, given the specific downsides of 
each of these and each user's preference.  This is not to say that spam 
prevention should not be at the top of the list of plugins to include.

As far as suggestions are concerned, wp-db-backup is already in 
wp-plugins.org and ready to go, even with i18n support.  (An easy way to 
sift for qualifying plugins could be on whether they support i18n!)

And if you would allow me the hubris of recommending another plugin that 
I helped with, the search-docs plugin (also already in wp-plugins.org) 
could be very helpful, since it seems that all of our context-sensitive 
help links have vanished.

Both of those plugins have signifiant wow-factor with their ajax 
capabilities.  They both incorporate functions that users often wonder 
why they're not already part of WordPress, not just a nice/clever extra 
feature.  They're both reasonably established plugins, even though I 
would like to see more testing on any plugin that would be included with 
the distribution.

On a related tangent, has any more consideration been given to packing a 
different Default theme with 1.6?  This may be something to discuss 
further next IRC meetup.

Please please can there be LOTS of discussion about this - this single
issue could swamp the forums (does anyone on this list have any idea how
many Default Theme issues we have to deal with ?). If people start
saying things like CSS2 / Ajax then I trust they will provide all the
requested support.

WP-Cache and the caching system implemented are vastly different, and
yes, WP-Cache could have major preformance benefits even over the
built-in object caching.

Here's a list of plugins I use all the time. Some of
theme (Fold page list, for example) might be better
integrated into the core than a plugin, but I couldn't
just pick two!

Fold page list
(http://www.webspaceworks.com/resources/cat/wp-plugins/30/)

Registered only
(http://carthik.net/blog/vault/2005/05/12/registered-only-plugin-reworked/)

WP DB backup (http://www.skippy.net/blog/plugins/) and
maybe WP-Cron

That reminds me, I definately vote for inclusion of WP-Cron in the
core, so that other plugins may take advantage of its existance. Or,
even if its just a plugin that's deactivated by default, at least we
know we can activate it to take advantage of it.

I agree that for busy sites WP-Cache will give a lot but cause tha
presence of the object caching system i don't think it would be a
"basic" plugin to add to the list.

I agree, WP-Cron it's really usefull, with WP-DB-Backup and a Gmail
account you can forget to manually do backup ;)

My 3 plugins would be:

- Antispam: BadBehavior i think
- WP-DB-Backup: peoples often forget to backput until problems appears
and it's too late
- An image gallery... but not sure what it should be.

My vote would have to be with a backup plugin as well. WP-DB-Backup is
pretty small at around 30KB, is used pretty widely and has made it
through such trials as backup weekend, so I'd call it mature. Of
course, it's also a plugin that promotes good practice.

* Spam
   I like Akismet. I like the idea and implementation. I like that fact 
that it is, essentially, BUILT to work with Wordpress. Straight forward, 
simple to use, and highly effective. If there was someway to give 
akismet users an easy way to register and get an API key built into the 
plugin (a sort of 'welcome to akismet, got a key? enter here or get one 
here' screen after activation) then it would be the ideal choice.

* Stats
   I did a nice port of ShortStat at one point (wp-shortstat), but it'd 
need some work to get it ready for 1.6 (shoot, it doesn't even work in 
1.5 anymore because of various tiny changes to the core :/ ) However, 
most of the work on this is done and is ready to be extended to include 
fun WP specific stats (rss feed pulls, user comment count stats, etc 
etc). Plus with all the AJAX we're throwing into WP, you could add some 
'Mint-like' fun to it.

* Gallery
   The 1.6 functionality of being able to do inline upload and drag&drop 
is cool, but it ultimately falls short of the goal of having some kind 
of gallery functionality. This could be substituted for by including a 
high quality Flickr plugin -- but that would come back to the same issue 
Akismet has of needing another account on another service (except that 
Flickr accounts are easier to get)

How about some basic/simple things first, which can be readily usable
after install:

- colophon (or about page creation - eaxample: K2; kudos to Michael
and Chris for this; simple pleasures of not editing source file is
very cool for a normal user).
- archives
- a contact form.

These would make a blog complete in itself and give any first time
user a kickstart.

David's idea is excellent.
+1.
Backup should be a default feature and must be a priority. I'd add
this to the top of my list.

To  address  the principal question, all depends on personal  preferences,
experience,  the nature of the blog, and traffic. Thus there will never be
an agreement among everyone.

In  my humble opinion, colophon is not a crucial bit and an E-mail address
can  be quoted in its explicit form. For user navigation and SEO, archives
are  very much necessary and should probably be enabled 'out of the  box'.
In  their absence, people will rarely (if ever) bother to read the 'grave-
yard'  of  posts. Backup plug-ins are also important. Many neglect to  get
copies of the database because of proficiency barriers. Do not forget that
nowadays,  most  bloggers are not IT-savvy. There is no pain greater  than
the  loss of all blog content. That's why I consider these to be must-have
functionalities, which don't require much 'fiddling'. Bad behaviour -- be-
ing a third contender -- likewise.

Roy

Maybe I'm missing something, but WP has archives by default. By date, 
and by category. With RSS feeds.

And the archive plugins pointed out so far make heavy use of AJAX which 
is not as friendly to SEO as it could probably be.

Yeah, the SEO thing is covered, but for actual humans the archives are 
pretty cumbersome.

Good point. I hadn't realised that the plug-in mentioned by Firas involves
JavaScript, which spiders will never bother with. Although I have seen the
plug-in  in question, I thought it was pure-CSS. If someone disables (e.g.
comments  out)  standard sidebar archives in favour of this  plug-in,  the
blog indeliberately gets narrow and scarsely crawled.

What I found most impeding (both for humans and for deepcrawls) are LIMITs
on the number of fetched items (20 by default?), which means that calendar
(if  made  visible) is among few ways of getting to *all* posts. In  blogs
where  200  items are posted per month (centralised in a small  number  of
categories), this becomes a worrying bottleneck.

Roy

If we're going to limit what we can do in browser functionality by  
what search engines can do, we're on the wrong track.

If SEO is an issue, detect the search engines by their agent string  
and give them a non-ajax theme optimized for them. That way, user  
themes can freely use ajax and give a much better user experience.

That would make no sense, of course.

But to get this back on subject. Having a good, centralized page that 
can give a browsing user a much better archive exploration sense is 
something that WP does sorely miss.

There are general archive pages (a list of posts ordered by date -- 
essentially the home page if you hit "previous posts" enough) but they 
are not what they could be. The side bar is far to cumbersome to be 
called sufficient.

While a plugin would supplement this area, ultimately the core WP should 
feature a more comprehensive and centralized page as an archive jumping 
point like these serve to do.

This thread is creeping in the direction of the question, "what themes
should be included with WordPress?" The question for this thread is
"what plugins should be included with WordPress?" Just thought I'd
throw that out there :-)

True - but I wasn't asking for more themes, I was asking for more  
functionality, and that was the purpose of the thread.

If that can be accommodated by having search engines get their own  
non-javascripted look-and-feel, I don't much care if that's done by  
including a plugin or by including a theme, or both.

I've been using the bloxpress plugin for a few days, and I like what  
I see. I don't want the direction I'm going crippled by somebody  
worried about SEO.

It  is  often  the *nature* of blog composition  (namely  linearity)  that
should  take  the blame. It would be nice to combine inferred  information
like tags, categories, context and so forth and convert 'some blog' into a
*topical* site.

How  many  of  us will ever enter a blog to explore it  in  its  entirety?
Either blogs get syndicated or the front page checked periodically[1]. Why
do  we  not follow the same path with so-called typical/proper Web  sites?
Because the user experience is entirely different.

[1] To be complete, there are also search engines referrals, which are im-
portant as they attract readerships and subscribers.

If you could isolate Google, XML site maps would probably provide a better
answer.  Search engines loathe it when the user-agent string gets  sniffed
and  different content is delivered for optimisation purposes. It is often
perceived as cloaking and can lead to banishment.

and I think that Subscribe 2 Comments should be enabled by default in

since WP-Cron has already been suggested to be included, I've a 
suggestion,
better or not is up to you guys to decide. How about giving the user an 
option
to backup the DB at regular intervals, which the user can choose in the 
Options?
further, the user can choose the backup to be emailed to him if he wants 
or
have the backup done to a non-public directory on the server.

I don't know whether this is currently possible by combining WP-Cron & 
Skippy's
DB backup plugin, but it sure would be nice to give user this feature 
out-of-box
without requiring him to procure plugins from anywhere, since as I've 
seen, non-tech
users generally don't pay any attention to backups etc. of DB as such & 
then they
are really in a state of panic when their DB is lost somehow!!

I disagree that this should be a default plugin.  Notification of
updates for posts and comments should really be occuring with RSS and
Atom feeds (whenever we get back Atom for comments, hint hint).  For
those people who categorically reject embracing the new technology, the
plugins exist (as do services like Bloglet (www.bloglet.com)).  Bundling
subscribe-to-comments (or my own subscribe2 plugin for new post
notifications) would be a step back from the utility of syndication.

I'd vote that Mark's recent "Redirect Old Slugs" plugin be bundled (or
added to the core), so that we can use the word "permalink" with a
little more accuracy.

That is what WP-DB-Backup pkugin does if WP-Cron is installed :)

I agree with you totally, giving "classic" system to follow blog post
and comments will not enoourage people to use new tecnology.

1)  Comment Spam Management
*****************************************
I echo all of the sentiment for a default comment spam plug-in.  I use Bad
behavior and Spam Karma and love them.  This is such an important issue that
perhaps it deserves core/API level attention.

2) Contact Form
*****************************************
This is such a simple, light (code wise) thing to accomplish, it should be a
default Page.  If folks don't need it, they turn it off.  I do not think
that will be the case that often.

3) DB Backup Tools
*****************************************
When reviewing plug-in install or core upgrade docs, one is always prompted
to back up the DB first.  I am can handle MySQL from the CLI, the vast
majority of users cannot. So, I'd install a DB backup plug-in by default, or
better yet write a simple tool into the core.  It needn't be elaborate.

A)  Set back up configs (email or local file).  If email, provide email
address.

B) Provide a "Backup DB Now" Button.  On click, it dumps the MySQL DB to a
file in wordpress/backups and gives it a date/timestamp in the filename.  If
email is selected, it emails said file (or a link to it) to the assigned
email address.

C) Measures like password-protected/encrpted archives could be used to
ensure data security.

	Management)
In-Reply-To: <000001c5e774$3b5620d0$6702a8c0@DB>
Message-ID: <BF9CDFBD.E464%apakuni@gmail.com>

My previous post outlined the three current plug-ins I'd most like to see in
1.6.  However, the big kahuna of enhancements would be an extended, embedded
plug-in manager in the core itself.   I've outlined how I think it
could/should work below.

1) HOW IT COULD WORK
***********************************************

A) The Plug-in "Store"
---------------------------
This would be a new tab under "Plugins" which would pull in descriptions of
available plug-ins WITHIN Wordpress.  Think of the iTunes music store.

The "store" would list aggregate and categorize all of the plug-ins found on
the various plug-in sites and provide plug-in devs a centralized way to
alert the installed community to the presence/state of their software.

To populate the "Store", plug-in devs would simply fill out a form on WP.org
, or better yet register an RSS feed with WP.org.  This feed would describe
their plug-in(s) and provide download URIs and other relevant info like
version numbers.  WP.org would, in turn, publish a master plugins RSS file
which would be read in by all WP installs and displayed on the "Store"
pages.

In addition to all of the descriptive data, each plug-in would include an
"Install" link.  For additional detail, see Item C below.

B) "Installed" Plugins
---------------------------
In the "Store", installed plug-ins would either not appear or would be
color-coded to indicate their installed status and/or if an upgrade was
available. In addition to the "Store" tab, there would be an "Installed"
tab.  

The "Installed" screen would function almost exactly like the current
"Plugin Management" screen.  The only difference would be in the "Version"
column.   The screen would check the installed plugins version number
against the "Store" RSS.  If the plug-in is current, the Version column
would indicate this with "Current".

If not, it would indicate this with an "Upgrade?" link.     For additional
detail, see Item C below.

C) Embedded Installs/Upgrades
-------------------------------
After clicking on the "Install?" or "Upgrade?" link, WP would follow the URI
provided by the devs and save the required files to the plugins directory
(if a new install) or plugins/upgrades if an upgrade.  New installs would
simply appear on the "Installed" screen for configuration and activation.

Upgrades might require a new tab called "Pending Upgrades".  Clicking on
this tab would show all captured upgrades.  Devs could write specific
upgrade scripts if DB tables are affected and create a "archive/restore"
path if needed.

D) Plug-in Rating
---------------------------
Users could centrally rate plug-ins and these ratings would appear in the
"Store".  This rating system would be a great help to users and devs (both
core and plug-in) alike.

E) Plug-in Watch List
---------------------------
Another possible tab would allow users to "subscribe" to the developer's RSS
feed for a given plug-in.  If one likes the bleeding edge, they can install
beta or nightly plug-in builds as they become available.  Or, simply follow
the development notes until the feature(s) they want become available or the
next point release goes "gold".

F) Extend to Themes
---------------------------
Once developed for plug-ins, this toolset could very simply be extended to
include theme management as well.

G) Dev Tracking Plug-In
---------------------------
Once the functionality is in place, a special module could be created and
distributed to all core and plug-in devs.  This module would provide devs a
common UI for tracking notes, publishing releases and distributing
documents.  This plug-in would then create the RSS feeds for all of the
developer's plug-ins or themes.   These feeds would then be auto-registered
with the central plug-in feed at WP.org.


2) WHY IT SHOULD BE DONE
***********************************************

A) Provides a simple, central mechanism for plug-in publishing, discovery,
"subscription", rating and install/upgrade management.

B) The upgrade functionality could, at least in theory, be extended to the
core itself.

C) The collective toolset would greatly reduce the support burden in IRC and
forums by putting the solutions to the following questions in the hands of
the end users ...

"What is the best plug-in to install to address XYZ
problem/need/functionality?"
"How do I install XYZ plug-in?"
"How do I upgrade XYZ plug-in?"
"What does plug-in XYZ do for me?"

D) By moving providing self-help tools for end-users, the need for for
forums and IRC will not be reduced, but the "signal to noise" ratio will
greatly improved.  In simpler terms, core AND plug-in devs can focus more on
next generation code rather than handholding less sophisticated, though no
less important, end users.

E) Helps devs get the word out about their plug-ins and themes.


3) POSSIBLE CHALLENGES, SOLUTIONS & BENEFITS
***********************************************

A) Core Changes Required
---------------------------
Challenge: 
This would require pretty significant changes to the existing plug-in
manager.  

Benefit:
In the long run, this change will solve more problems than it creates.  And,
the increased usability for the less technically adept end user should
significantly expand WP's user base/footprint in the "blogosphere".

B) File System Permissions
---------------------------
Challenge:
Install/Upgrade tools would require file-system permissions to write and
then execute install/upgrade scripts and/or DB back up files.  This creates
potential security holes which must be addressed and it may be confusing for
less technically sophisticated end users.

Solution:
These issues can be addressed during the initial WP install or upgrade by
stepping the end-user through permissions settings in much the same manner
as is done with wp-config.php.   Also, in the unlikely event that a
malicious dev be found to distributing malware through his RSS
install/upgrade feed, there is a central mechanism (the "Store") for killing
the feed and reporting the devs action to the entire install base.

Benefit:
Even if "How do I set permissions?" questions filter into IRC/forum support
channels, this is a "fix once" issue for the majority of end-users.  Once
the permissions are set and embedded install/upgrade is working properly,
then the user and dev community enjoy all of the benefits described above.

yes, I agree with you, but the problem most non-techies have with RSS is 
that they
have to download & install a seperate software for aggregating the feeds 
or signup
for one more service like Bloglines to stay in touch.

Now people might argue that these guys can simply use LiveBookmarks for 
FireFox or
Opera but there's no denying the fact that IE still has the major 
share(more than 80%
last I read). Another arguement can be that they can use Thunderbird as 
their email
client but then there are a lot of users of Outlook/Outlook Express who 
simply wouldn't
want to change their preferred email client just b'coz of this. As I 
remember, there is
an addon for Outlook as well to syndicate feeds but that's not free & 
the point again
is that of downloading & installing a new software.

Another arguement that goes against syndication of feeds(as far as 
non-techies are
concerned) is that they add up as a clutter in the aggregator. I mean, 
say they subscribe
to 100 or so posts on different blogs, now this will keep increasing. On 
the otherhand
with email notification, its just subscribe & forget as far as the end 
user is concerned.
They just get an email when there's a comment on a post they subscribed 
to, no matter
how old that post is(if you were thinking about deleting old feeds from 
the aggregator).

I thought that technology was about making lives easy & improving 
usability, not to make
lives more complicated!!

I'd welcome any comments on my thoughts above!! :)

oh well, I didn't know about that!! thanks!! if this feature(these two
plugins I mean) is put in by default in WordPress, then that would be
cool as far as non-techie users are concerned since that often
overlook the importance of DB backups & if they get the tool right
there without any extra effort, they are more likely to use it.

I chose to offer "subscribe to comments" in addition to the built-in RSS 
feeds because subscribing to comments via RSS just isn't a good 
experience yet. The support isn't there on the aggregator side to handle 
it in a sane manner and RSS aggregator penetration isn't that high.

I think the purpose should be to make it easier for both authors and 
readers to participate in a conversation. Authors are already given the 
option of being subscribed to the comments via email for any of their 
posts, they are not forced to subscribe to the comments feed.

WordPress doesn't choose sides in these squabbles of format, ie. RSS v. 
Atom, so why should it choose which method a reader uses to subscribe to 
comments for a post?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comments and Google Maps
Message-ID: <6F6B0E53-525B-4C0C-A8B6-B48C15F8481F@bravo5.org>

Good evening, all.  I'm trying to find a way to plot the location of  
commenters on a Google Map within a Page in WP.  I don't yet see a  
plugin for this, so I'm going to attempt to whack something  
together.  If this has already been done by someone, please let me  
know so I can stop wasting my time and everyone elses'. :-)

The basic concept is this: have a Page (in WP parlance) titled  
something along the lines of "Reader Locations", and collect on that  
page, via comments, the location of the commenter.  I intend to  
create a plugin that will add several fields (post code, lat/lon) to  
the comment form, and then, from within the page, present a Google  
Map with the locations plotted onto it.  This started off seeming  
fairly simple, but now I'm starting to see some additional complexity.

It looks like, in order to store the additional geographical  
information about the comment, I will have to create my own table in  
the DB.  Is this correct?  Is there any existing mechanism for  
storing arbitrary data about a comment?

I'd say that's the first thing I'm struggling with.  Once I'm able to  
store the content, enabling a Page or post with this capability will  
be simply adding a custom field or checking a box when editing the  
post.  I'll probably provide another PHP template that will provide  
the comments as an XML file to be consumed by the mapping code.

Is there a good example to follow that does something similar?

Thanks,
B

First of all, I suggest you have a look at the following:

http://www.mapservices.org/myguestmap/

I  assume you are familiar with MyGuestmap already, but I should  probably
not assume anything. The service plots readership, not comments, but these
are technically similar.

I  once subscribed to the service, but did not take this further since, if
I  remember  correctly, JavaScript needed to be inserted to all pages.  In
turn, it 'calls home' and gathers statistics on somebody else's server and
exploits  somebody  else's traffic. Much like Flickr, they are willing  to
give away traffic with future expansion in mind. This can, in turn, trans-
form  the third-party service into one you are uncomfortable with (if  not
loathe).  This makes you plug-in a very desirable one in comparison and  I
think it will attract enormous interest among WordPress users, particular-
ly if it is made trivial to install. Having said that, MyGuestmap recently
moved from a .br domain to a .org domain, which is a good sign, for them.

Will it perhaps be worth anonymising? People might not want to be publicly
bound to an IP address or, even worse, their postcode and location. I sup-
pose you speak of a temporary (intermediate) solution here.

How about a schema for 'user'? If commenters return time after time, there
might  be plenty of duplication. If you change the database, however, this
would make the plug-in difficult to install and retract.

How  about  changing wp-post-comment.php (not sure about the filename)  to
include  a call to a completely separate and new function which does noth-
ing but accumulate IP addresses or locational information? This will leave
everything  else unchanged. This isolation would be a healthy one for rea-
sons I described in the previous paragraph.

I can think of other services (including ones which use Yahoo's API) where
the  intention is assign items to locations in the map. As there are  many
of them, there is probably place for re-use of source code.

Hope it helps,

Roy

Elixir is a project by Firas Durri, Robert Deaton and Andrew
Sutherland (wp-elixir.com) that is setting out to be the ultimate
plugin manager for WordPress. It will basically duplicate all the
features available to package managers like RPM and That Gentoo One
(which I can't remember the name of right now :))

Along with it's plugin counterpart, Alchemy, Elixir will allow for
one-click install of plugins (and themes?), allow for dependancies
etc. (i.e., WP-DB-Backup could require WP-Cron), as well as
automagically handling updates.

Oh, and it'll do away with chmod, too. :)

yeah, that certainly looks promising the way it has been touted as, but
they are still working on it & I don't think that its even in a beta 
stage,
or if it is, then its a private beta since they don't have any more info 
on
the website!! :)

btw, since we have an official plugin repository at wp-plugins.org, why

where they can browse the available plugins(via RSS or XMLRPC) and

& wp-themes.org can be integrated like that as well.

I was not.  It looks similar to Frappr.com.  It's not doing it for  
me. :-)

It's nice to have an idea that others appreciate. :-) I don't think  
it's going to be simply a drop-in thing, however.  There's only one  
extension point for the comments form, and that puts additional  
fields *after* the submit button (and not very neatly, at that).   
This will probably mean that the user will have to modify or create a  
Page template (if they choose to limit this functionality to just  
Pages) to make the comments form look prettier.

I will also need to figure out how to display the map on the Page;  
perhaps I can do that via a filter...

I'm doing this in the vein of Frappr, which allows you to specify a  
post code, and it's done in such a way that the user is expected to  
*not* be anonymized.  Again, this will be the user voluntarily  
contributing their location, so it'll be up to them to give up their  
location.  I don't feel there's a need right now to hide their identity.

Oh, can arbitrary user data be stored?  I didn't realize that.

Continuing along with comments on a blog, perhaps I've lived a  
sheltered life, but I've yet to see a single WP blog that uses an  
account (or even provides a "register" link) for people posting  
comments.  That might make sense in a more closed-door community, but  
not for what I've got in mind.  For example, two different sites in  
the last week (whiteroofradio.com and motoringfile.com) have created  
Frappr maps for people to add their location if they read the site.   
That's what I'm trying to emulate.  I think there's value in being  
able to display the map and collect the data within the confines of  
WP and without sending the user to another site.

I'm unfortunately aware of the limitation of creating a new table,  
but provided I don't modify the schema of any existing tables (which  
did briefly flit across my mind), it won't really be impacting  
anything...

Ah, without the user's explicit interaction?  Not a bad idea, except  
that the ip->geo data isn't good enough.  My IP (sometimes!) shows me  
being in Chicago.  I live in Indianapolis.

Go ahead and write that and then we can talk about including it.  Since 
1.6's release is imminent, let's talk about plugins that are actually 
available.

No denying the fact? Where did you read it? On my site IE is not the #1

Pete,
80% browser share for IE is a commonly thrown about number based on some 
averages done by the large web stat firms.
Don't distract yourself with things like "On my site IE isn't #1" 
because your friends could all be on Macs and prefer Safari or be 
luddites and prefer Lynx. Who knows. Each site is different.

Enough opinion, let's throw out some stats:

Date reported, Market share, and reporting firm:
09-23-05      88.46%      WebSideStory
11-02-05      85.45%      OneStat
09-02-05      86.87%      NetApplications
10-11-05      85.09%      Janco Associates

 From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer#Usage_share

Finally, a word from that learned scholar Homer Simpson:

 *Kent: *Mr. Simpson, how do you respond to the charges that petty
       vandalism such as graffiti is down eighty percent, while heavy
       sack-beatings are up a shocking nine hundred percent?
*Homer: *Aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent.
       Forfty percent of all people know that.
 *Kent: *I see.

Brian, a hack I used to add a "preview" button for my comments preview
plugin, without requiring the user to modify templates, might help
here.

There's a line in the wp-includes/comment-functions.php file that
applies the 'comments_template' filter to the file name of the
comments:
$include = apply_filters('comments_template', TEMPLATEPATH . $file );

It's meant to allow you to change the file name of the comments
template.  What I did was change it to the path of my plugin file (so
that it would return true but do nothing), but I read the original
comments template file into a variable, used regular expressions to
make my changes, and then evaluated it to mimic the include action of
the core file.  Here's a stripped-down version:

function replace_comments_file ($comments_filepath) {
$comments_template = file_get_contents($comments_filepath);
$comments_template = preg_replace( * whatever *);
eval('?>' . $comments_template );
return __FILE__;
}

add_filter('comments_template', 'replace_comments_file');

I'm not a typical user, so my personal plugin list isn't of much use.

But I still have an opinion on the matter :) In some cases I may name a 
specific plugin due to familiarity, but generally speaking it's the 
*idea* that I'm promoting, rather than a particular implementation.

Gravatars/Favatars: lightweight, adds visual interest, indirectly 
encourages more participation in commenting. The main downside is that 
gravatars depend on a third-party service. But I think it's definitely 
worth consideration. When I eventually get around to redesigning my 
site, some form of gravatar plugin will definitely be included.

Some sort of "local weather" plugin. You know, for when you can't be 
bothered to look out the window. Seriously, though, much like *vatars, 
these tend to be visually interesting and moderately dynamic, with just 
enough "neato" factor.

Customizable Post/Comment Listings: Good sidebar fodder. Dynamic, easy 
to fold into the default templates with a simple conditional.

Contact form: Let's face it, this is a popular request. Something 
simple, with built-in protection against empty form submissions, and 
maybe even hooks into our spam filtering (though merely to flag the 
message, not to reject it outright).

Subscribe to Comments: Let's face it -- while many of us reading this 
mailing list might be RSS power-users, your average joe still doesn't 
know RSS from TCP/IP. But everybody knows what email is.

Tags (Bunny's, Ultimate Tag Warrior, etc): The ability to add additional 
keywords beyond a post's main categories in a manner that enhances its 
"findability" is quite useful and powerful. Let's make the long tail 
even longer.

Lastly, I would specifically vote *against* including any extra 
anti-spam plugin. I know, I know, you're all in shock. Trust me, I hate 
spam *at least* as much as you do. But the default WP grey/blacklist 
(when used properly) works pretty darned well for most sites. And 
spam-blocking is tricky and potentially dangerous if you aren't careful. 
I don't think any of us want new users losing comments just because they 
enabled a default plugin without realizing the potential implications.

Caveat: We might consider Eric Meyer's Gatekeeper plugin. It's not an 
automated spam killer, it's simple in function, and will stop some of 
the more stupid spambots without adding too much burden on commenters.

Instead of trying to identify the 3 best plugins across all use cases, 
maybe it would be worth considering alternative wordpress packages. 
There could be a personal wordpress package which would be the standard 
WP core, plus 2-3 plugins that personal sites would be most likely to 
use, a professional package, expert package, etc. (I don't know what 
would be the best breakdown of packages) They could even be packaged 
with or without the core Wordpress distro.

Personally I would vote for a lean wordpress core tarball and have 
additional tarballs for cases mentioned above.

Just a thought.

These are excellent choices.

Ability to control access across a group of posts (by category, by  
ranking) is very important in many organizational contexts.

Message-ID: <200511150122.38704.burguet@cern.ch>

Hi,

I have written a little converter from bBlog (http://www.bblog.com/) to 
Wordpress, which can add the posts to a working wordpress blog. I needed such 
a tool myself, because I wanted to switch but couldn't find anything similar. 
Although it is quite basic, it may interest you, or people outside there who 
have the same problem I had. At least the code is easy to extend and handle 
more complicated conversions.

Well. hope this is the correct list to mention it!

Thanks very much for Wordpress, it is an extremely nice piece of software. 
Cheers,
jordi

languages folder - this to still live inside wp-includes ?

I personally vote that we move the languages folder to somewhere into
wp-content, for the whole upgrading reason that has been previously
discussed.

Plugins on/off, I could really care less about.

Agreed. I mention it because when upgrading plugins can and do cause
errors. Those familiar with WP just dig in and sort it, those that do
not run to the forums. It's partly speed - it takes ages to deactivate a
number of plugins - and that is the one page which could do with some
ajax throwing at it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] idea: no SQL in themes
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0511151539590.2561@tribal.metalab.unc.edu>

Hello,

What do people think of the idea of not allowing database calls in themes? 
There would be an obvious security benefit, but also it would make it 
easier for less geeky people to develop wordpress themes.

Looking at a few themes it looks like the only calls to $wpdb methods that 
people use are 4 in comments-popup.php, and the query counter in the 
footer. This functionality could all easily be provided through wordpress 
functions.

So I guess the questions are:

[1] does anyone know of more extensive/custom/complicated sql that any 
particular themes use (therefore rendering SQL restriction a Bad Idea)?

[2] how difficult would it be to restrict calls to the database within 
themes? a few simple solutions pop to mind, i'm going to have to think a 
little more about what a comprehensive solution would entail.

Cheers,
John

I don't see any reason for positively banning SQL calls, but certainly
providing a comprehensive API for all possible DB calls is a good
idea.

I honestly think that there is no real way to stop database queries
from within themes, and I don't see the security benefit from it.
Sure, you may say stopping SQL from running would make it more secure,
but don't you think there are other areas we should be focusing
on...shell_exec, popen, etc. SQL should be the least of our worries,
and I don't think this sort of security is really much of a worry at
all.

Well, a malicious person could distribute a theme that had

   $wpdb->query("TRUNCATE $wpdb->posts");

The chances of someone doing this and succeeding in convincing others to 
install it are slim, but non-zero. As WordPress becomes more popular it 
will become more of a threat.

A more likely scenario is someone having a typo, some debug code, or just 
some bad logic, that worked fine during testing but on someone else's 
setup is destructive to data.

I think people generally don't think of a theme as being capable of 
affecting their data. A somewhat savy but non-programmer wordpress user 
might backup their DB before installing a plugin, but not before 
installing a theme.

Thoughts?

John

p.s. I thought of this is because I am working on a multi-blog branch of 
WordPress [http://lyceum.ibiblio.org], so it is a much bigger problem for 
me because a buggy/malicious theme could damage every single blog in the 
installation. But it is still an issues for single user WP, and such a 
features could also perhaps benefit WordPress MU. I see (at least on 
wordpress.com, I haven't checked recent builds) that MU does not allow 
per-blog theme customization.

This has probably been mentioned before, but it seems to be inelegant:
Click Lost Password
Get sent to a screen that has a login link
Get reset email
Click the link in that and get sent to a screen with another login link
Get new password and a direct link to the login page.

I have no idea how to improve it but having just had to do this twice I
thought I'd mention it.

one of my beta testers complained about this and suggested the following 
process:

1) fill out lost password form
2) system emails you a special URL to visit
3) you visit the special URL
4) this web page has you type in a new desired password. As a bonus, it 
automatically logs in you too.

Without devising a fully tag-based templating system that would
inevitable force us to lose some of the power of templates due to the
lack of the ability to use real PHP, I'm afraid that blocking out SQL
is, to my knowledge, impossible without modification of php.ini.

Even if $wpdb was not available, the standard mysql calls are, or
regular function calls are, in which case you could wrap functions in
a plugin that you ask to be bundled and execute it from there, or even
include another file that defines the functions. Heck, you could even
grab the values of the constants set in wp-config and open up your own
mysql connection. The odds of us being able to stop this are severly
in our disfavor.

If your multiblog implementation would like to devise a complete tag
based system like that of MovableType to solve this problem, you're
more than welcome to mess with it, but I highly doubt anything like
this going into the WordPress core.

Hi,

I searched the archives using gmane, but I couldn't find the answer hope 
you don't mind me asking this one.

Will there be significant changes in the way themes are handled in 1.6 
comparing to 1.5.2? If so can you point to some more info regarding the 
specifics differences.

Thanks in advance!

I like your suggestion, but it is slightly less secure. In your flow  
below, someone could theoretically type in the URL with a guessed  
forgotten password key, create a new password and get right in. By  
mailing a new password to the user, someone would have to have access  
to your mailbox to steal your password via the forgot password feature.

A proper key -- like, say, a hash of the generated password -- is as
secure as the password itself, no?

hi
Actually I think the first step to cure this behaviour might be very 
simple: get rid of this first loginlink which  makes you think that this 
was all.
Replace it with a text "New password on it's way. Check your inbox".
Suddenly everything makes perfect sense ;)

just my 2 cents :)

It's true, a malicious theme distributer might ask the user to install a 
certain plugin. It would be hard to protect against that case.

But for the theme-only case, right off the bat it seems like it would be 
possible to restrict theme access to $wpdb, class wpdb, and wp-config.php, 
by having them check for the path of the calling/including file. I swear I 
have seen this done in PHP before... I will investigate and get back.

Unless you plan on parsing the files beforehand, it can't be done, and
even then some minor obfuscation could get right around it. Moving to
a non-PHP templating system is the only way to avoid this.

I think the point is that even if you were able to unset $wpdb or make 
$wpdb unavailable to the theme and still have WordPress function, you 
could still do this:

mysql_query('TRUNCATE wp_posts');

This is a PHP function that you can't disable, and it's really a better 
attack than trusting to the WP database object.

Maybe it's better to spend this time educating users on verifying the 
safety of their themes.  I haven't seen any overtly malicious themes 
yet, have you?  I imagine a system will soon exist for obtaining peer 
reviews on themes, either via themes.wordpress.net or Elixir, which 
should quell this issue a bit.

To date I know of only two 'dodgy' themes. One has adsense code embedded
along with the publisher ID (or whatever it's called) and the other had
a few links hidden in the footer.

Indeed.  Themes shouldn't use $wpdb directly.  We need to provide API
for them to use. Taking comments-popup.php as an example:

$comments = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT * FROM $wpdb->comments WHERE
comment_post_ID = $id AND comment_approved = '1' ORDER BY
comment_date");

This could be replaced with something like
get_approved_comments($post_id).

$commentstatus = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT comment_status, post_password
FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE ID = $id");

This should use get_post() so that the cache is used.

I agree totally with you and Podz, moving language it's necessary.
Even the idea to have a global toggle for plugins it's a good idea

Dear Friends ,

I've just heard about one of my friends(http://behdad.org) projects on
google called "Google Summer of Codes
http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html", A place to match Students & Open
Source projects , Currently (and just after less than 3 months) plenty(near
40) of open source projects participate this program , you can see in the
list some of famous PHP based open source softwares like Drupal, Gallery,
Horde.

I am now thinking about Wordpress joining the program ... Is it possible?
Any Idea?

This has actually been discussed before. I have just tracked down the 
thread in
case you would like to find out more:

I'm still waiting the the Winter of Code, but something tells me it

I think if there's any shot of WordPress joining, you'll need to wait
a few months anywyas, as it is certainly fall here in the US, where
google is headquartered, so we've got a while before the "Summer" of
code starts back up again

Summer of Code ended September 1st, 2005. There was some talk about a Winter of Code taking place, but that has been denied by Google at this point.

Google may very well launch a new SoC next summer, but there has not been any official announcement regarding that as of yet. Gallery, which I'm closely involved with, was a part of the SoC this summer and it was a great experience for all of us. Mentors and coders alike. If Wordpress gets a chance to take part of this the next time 'round, take it. It was well worth it!

Has this discussion come helped decide what plugins should/will be bundled
in 1.6? It seems that most people think it should include a comment-spam
plugin, and a database backup (possibly scheduled) plugin. Does this mean
this will make it into 1.6? Will a definite decision be made soon?

That does the two examples you picked out in comments-popup.php, and
also replaces $wpdb->num_queries with get_num_queries() in footer.php
for completeness.

An older version of WPMU used Smarty templates - it's still used on 
blogs.linux.ie and powers my blog at http://blogs.linux.ie/xeer/
Using Smarty in secure mode is a pretty good way of allowing users to 
edit their templates. It does of course require that all templates be 
rewritten. :(
It's not as flexible as the PHP templates, but that's not because it's 
using Smarty, WPMU was using Smarty before the current PHP templates 
were in WordPress and didn't get as much thought or design.

http://blogsome.com/ uses the same version which is how they allow 
editing of templates.

You could examine all the PHP commands in a template using the PHP 
tokeniser and only allow a subset. I explored that possibility here: 
http://blogs.linux.ie/xeer/2005/07/12/security-checking-php-templates/

Recently I thought about using the markdown engine to convert templates 
from a "user safe" form into standard PHP templates and back again for 
editing but haven't looked at it at all.

Another compromise is to allow editing of the CSS stylesheet. That would 
be a lot easier to secure.

Donncha.

Well, apparently it wasn't done, so I did it.  The (in progress)  
result is here:
	http://bravo5.org/blog/2005/11/17/testing-the-geocomments-plugin/

I'm having a problem with Safari showing the map properly  
*sometimes*.  I'm working on that.

The other problem I'm having is that this isn't going to be a drop-in  
kind of deal that will work with Pages.  Pages don't have the same  
hooks for actions and filters that regular posts do.  I really want  
this to work with Pages, so I guess I'll have to provide a sample  
template, but I think that this is a shortcoming of WordPress that  
really undermines the usability of Pages...  Should I report a bug on  
this, or is it a known area of enhancement?

The best option would be to make it work from the Wordpress Admin 
interface (like the other import scripts) and then submit it as a patch 
to be included in the core of wordpress.

See:

Yeah, but it's quite simple to use a little javascript to reformat the 
comment area correctly. And if you add it inside a <script /> tag in 
that hook, it happens right then and can be quite fast.

Of course, if they turn of JS, it'll still be ugly and below the button, 
but it'll work still.

Search for "function get_option" in the WordPress files. It allows you 
to store arbitrary data (there are similar functions for retrieving, 
updating, and deleting too.)

The same could be said for plugins. Distribute a largely complicated 
piece of code that fetches weather info a sneak in a quick "truncate all 
tables" command and you've got the same problem.

The only real solution would be some kind of verification system for 
plugins/themes which, to put it lightly, would be a major pain in the ass.

For just themes we could switch to a template system, but this has been 
overly discussed and isn't likely to happen.

Note, that the key will only exists if it has been requested. This seems 
just as secure as a password to me.

You could brute for the login script, or you could brute force the ... 
login script.

And if you give the key an expiration of, say, 5 minute it'd be all the 
more effective. (Maybe 10 -- who can't get an email in 10 minutes...)

Now that the "Personal" tab's disappeared from the Options menu, what
do you think about moving the "Import" tab off the main menu?

IMO, a good place for it is under "Manage."

Yep. It's not used much, it shouldn't have top-level priority.

I see Matt axed someone's suggestion that the importer be moved on
this ticket ( http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1884 ), but do you
think he'd be open to just moving it under the Manage tab?

Message-ID: <d6491f480511181154h738a081cxcd4059a1f9230bc6@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know of an easy way to allow certain sets of tags when
posting through xmlrpc? For example I want to be able to use
<tag>...</tag> and <itag>...</itag> to tag my posts when blogging from
my Treo using a client like u*Blogger but at the moment the tags just
get stripped.

I could hack something in to allow those tags I guess but I was
wondering if there was a cleaner way?

Tag is not a valid HTML element, and thus it is stripped if your user
doesn't have the "unfiltered_html" capability. Add this capability to
the user you are posting with and all should be well.

Well I know tag & itag aren't valid XHTML, Taggerati takes care of
generating the XHTML and what not before it gets posted but I forgot
to mention that this is running the latest SVN and posting via the
admin user with the Administrator role, which I thought should already
have the unfiltered_html capability.

If the host computer is Windows and smtp settings haven't been
configured in  PHP.ini or via an ini_set() command, that e-mail will
never arrive.

That was completely irrelevant, we assume you can set up your server
if you plan on running WordPress (or your host can set up your
server).

I think it was previously suggested that it should appear at different lo-
cations  depending  on  the  stage  of use.  In  most  curcumstances,  the
importer/s  will  be  used once, at the start. Subsequently,  this  option
would just consume screen space, unnecessarily so.

I  can't  remember the previous thread on that topic quite so  well.  Yet,
among  the possibilities was making the importers part of the installation
process. On the one hand, you want these to be visible and easily-accessi-
ble  to new users. Then again, in order to avoid clutter, maybe it's worth
putting  it under "Manage" and then, throughout installation, clearly tell
users something along the lines of:

"If  you  already have a blog, the next step to follow might be  'Import',
which  can be found under the menu 'Manage' at the top." (or click  >here<
to import your blog)

Take a look at http://wordpress.org/support/topic/24981 and tell me if
that's a safe assumption. It sure ain't a part of the 5-minute
install.

Message-ID: <ebe43d680511190239o25153dc2q@mail.gmail.com>

Now we've entered beta, would it be appropriate to call a feature
freeze? This would mean a couple of things:

* Any new code is just bugfixes
* Setting the milestone of all 'enhancement' bugs to 2.1

Personally, I think a couple of weeks worth of bug reporting and
subsequant squashing would be the way to prepare WP for 2.0 final. Any
new features are likely to introduce just as many bugs as get fixed by
them, and I'm sure there's still quite a few bugs lurking around the
tinymce and cache areas (for example) that really need to be fixed for
2.0 final.

What does everyone else think?

Since the Dashboard is eminently useless on first install (it's not as
though you have comments to track, or care about WordPress development
news), why not put some kind of welcome message there?

if (!get_settings('show_welcome')
// show dashboard ...
else

This a quick mockup of what I mean, though presumably it would be
rewritten by someone who actually knows what users want. :)

I think this is a good idea. Eclipse also use this feature when you open a
new workspace. The content should also still be available even after the
initial install.

WordPress makes several (IMHO) valid assumptions as part of the setup.
Namely, that you have php, apache, mail, mysql, etc, all set up. Of
course if you don't have these things it will take longer than 5 minutes
to install. However, I really don't think that the 5 minute install
should include instructions as far back in the process of "Determine
which webhost you would like to host with, feel free to purchase a
server and colocate it, or build a server yourself and colocate that.
Click here to determine what hardware needs your site will have, or
click here to skip to step 57 where you actually set up WordPress."

The point of the thread is determining a better way to handle Lost 
Password's. Both the current way or a revised way (keys, expirations, 
whatnot) will require a working email setup -- that's kinda going off topic.

And as stated later on in the thread, the assumption of a working mail() 
function is not far fetched.

Actually, some hosts disable a few functions in an effort to improve
security and/or to cut spam. mail(), in particular, isn't necessarily
available.

Well, the point is, that for all practical purposes a Web hosting server 
without working outbound mail is a broken server.  This is a problem
beyond the scope of WordPress.  They are not wrong to assume a
properly-configured, non-broken host that provides minimal standard
behavior, regardless of the operating system and specific
implementations of those standard services.  It is true that there are
hosting services doing dumb things as well, but this too is beyond the
scope of a WordPress install.  The marketplace will take care of those 
hosting services that deliberately break things.

There is already a page: http://wordpress.org/hosting/
that page lists hosting services "which meet the WordPress minimum
requirements", and I would suggest that these are minimal indeed, but
that http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/ ought to be updated a bit
to include:

   * Working outbound SMTP via the PHP Mail() function

And it should also probably mention that it is helpful to be able to
send mail using the domain name you're paying for the use of as opposed
to having to send it as the name of the Web server.

Has anyone tried running WordPress under PHP "Safe Mode"?

Dear weblog administrators,

 

Have you ever wondered why you are being targeted by blog spammers?  Having
worked with Trackback spam before, we have often felt that it was unclear as
to the exact mechanism by which Trackback spammers find their victims.
There has some evidence that some web spiders exist which look for Movable
Type Trackback URLs at conventional locations.  Presumably, there also exist
more sophisticated web spiders that examine webpages for a piece of RDF XML
that identifies the correct Trackback location-here, obfuscating your URL
will not prevent you from receiving a helping of blog spam in such cases.
But how do the spiders target you, their victim weblogs?

 

This problem has been under investigation by computer scientists at Rice
University.  We have developed a free Trackback plug-in called Trackback
Validator (http://freepastry.rice.edu/~dsandler/trackback/) to provide you
with security against these attackers; this plug-in has been beta tested by
a small set of weblogs-now it is ready for general use.  Beyond the
protection it provides, it will help us study how spammers locate sites like
your own!  

 

It is likely that these spiders follow links from other weblogs that they
know about to yours.  If so, this would help explain the power-law
distribution in spam:  the more popular your site, the more inbound links
and hence the more visible your site is to attackers.  The data collected on
identified spam postings will help us deduce some patterns in and sources of
weblog spamming plaguing your sites.  Hence, with the use of the Validator
plug-in, not only will you receive great protection from spam, but you will
also help us collect information about spammers targeting your site and help
us improve upcoming versions of our software for you!

 

Thank you very much and enjoy the world of spam-free blogging!

Misleading and ineffective, at least. Were it me, I would have said 
something more like "new release of the plugin we told you about back in 
August, which now adds foo and bar..."

> Besides, isn't the premise behind this plugin "Trackback URLs that point to

Absolutely. The plugin could just as easily be called "Turn Trackback 
into Pingback" (as Matt noted when they first announced it). One of the 
best examples, from when this first came up years ago, was "I see people 
posting all the time, asking 'why is the sky blue?' so I wrote a post 
explaining why, and when I see someone asking I send a Trackback ping to 
their post, so they and any readers who also wonder can find my answer. 
Since someone who has read my explanation doesn't have any reason to 
want to read hundreds of questions asking 'why?' I don't link to every 
post I ping."

You are of course free to ignore any ping that doesn't link to you, just 
like you are free to ignore any ping that includes the word "pink" and 
any ping that doesn't include "blue," but it's very much open to false 
positives.

That's a darn good mockup.  I'd say include it to ease newbies' transitions.

How exactly is this disabled? Is the mail() function removed totally?
If so, we could easily do a function_exists() on this and provide an
alternate (if less secure) method of recieving the password if mail()
doesn't exist.

If it's disabled at a lower level, we may have to be a bit more
creative in our resolution. It may not be worth doing at all, as
others have suggested.

on free.fr, I recall mail and chmod were removed entirely (this may have
changed since). They replaced it with a custom function with a different
name on the one side, and a server side script that automatically chmoded
stuff as required on the other.

Importers for the "Nukes" (Postnuke and PHP-Nuke) and Xaraya will get WP a
ton of new users.  I manually moved my stuff over and have lots of former
nukers asking me how I did it.  Usually, they do not want to suffer the pain
I did, so an importer would rock.

I completely agree with this. I converted to WP from Xaraya (to which
I'd converted from PostNuke some time before).

If it wasn't for WP's import-rss, I think it would have been MUCH harder
to convert my large site from Xaraya to WordPress. Importers for these
folks would be a great selling point.

Sorry about that.  The project's changed hands a couple of times  
(sometimes unavoidable with student projects), so I'm not sure  
everyone knew about previous announcements made to this list.

This is absolutely true.  Here's my take on why this is still  
useful:  The common case of Trackbacks is blogs linking to other  
blogs, where this additional reciprocal-link constraint seems  
reasonable.  (These same blogs are also the common-case target of  
Trackback spam.)  If this model doesn't match the way you use  
Trackback, this plugin probably isn't something you want to install.

Subject: [wp-hackers] uploads in 2.0
Message-ID: <43826DC0.3090906@skippy.net>

I'm not sure if this is a bug, which is why I bring it here instead of trac.

In 2.0, there still exists a Miscellaneous Option to enable uploads.
Enabling this seems to have no effect:
* no top-level Upload menu is activated
* the post screen's upload form is still present
* the post screen's upload form does not honor the additional filename
extensions I defined (ogg, for my test).

Is the Miscellaneous Option cruft to be removed, or is the missing
upload bit yet to be included?

Thanks!
Scott

Scott, the inline uploading box is almost capable of handling file
types beyond images. It is in no way linked to the options you see,
although that would be nice, huh? If you take a look at the uploading
functions, you'll see that they handle extension/mime relationships.
The options interface isn't designed to handle this yet. If you have a
great idea, write it up or better yet, code it!

Douglas, I suggest you have a look at the following:

It was posted in this mailing-list not so long ago.

If free.fr is doing free hosting (as best I can tell from the
translation I get) as they appear to be, then of course my previous
comments about the marketplace dealing with them deliberately breaking
things doesn't apply, and I am loathe to criticize free hosting services
that are providing PHP and MySQL for doing what they feel is necessary
given they have a different situation than paid services.

If they've removed the function entirely, then I presume that free.fr
users could put something like this in their wp-config.php

   if(!function_exists('mail'))
   {
     function mail(....
   }

and after doing the same for chmod they could use an unaltered WP and
not have to worry about extra work for upgrades.

Or the user could just install wp-phpmailer [1] which takes advantage of 
the pluggable-functions in wp 1.5.1 and later and replaces wp_mail() 
with a full SMTP implementation to talk directly to an SMTP server

Incidentally, free.fr pretty much is your marketplace in France. They
started as a free access ISP and have grown to be one of the four biggest
ISPs in the country. They are now into phone, DSL and ITV, and they have a
multi-million subscriber subscriber base. All get a free hosting account
indeed as part of their deal, and this free hosting package.

As for the mail function, it still exists -- last I tried, it would output a
'this function has been disabled' warning message. And on the top of my
head, something along the lines of the following would more likely be needed
as a replacement:

# default:

$GLOBALS['email_callback'] = 'mail';

# custom:

function custom_email($mailto, $subject, $message, $headers)
{
  # fetch emails from $mailto
  preg_match_all(pattern_email_list, $mailto, $out);
  $emails = end($out);
  
  # send emails one by one
  foreach ( $emails as $email )
  {
    return email($email, $subject, $message);
  }
}

$GLOBALS['email_callback'] = 'custom_email';

# usage:

call_user_func_array(
    $GLOBALS['email_callback'],
    array($to, $subject, $message, $headers)
    );

I put the parametres into a string passed to the function like in

Any help? Thanks in advance

I wonder then what it is they think they're accomplishing this way?  If
they're a major ISP then this whole diversion thing is pretty silly and
pointless.  Probably consumes a lot of support resources as well.

This is documented in the Codex:

   http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_pages

   wp_list_pages("child_of=$menu_ID");

If you need to pass more than one option, you might also want to review 
this page:

Message-ID: <1132740561.1474.33.camel@portnoy.fuzzybelly.org>

The Blogger and Textdrive importers have patrons.  Anyone want to adopt
the MT importer?  It's mostly there but needs a little love and lots of
testing.

http://trac.wordpress.org/file/trunk/wp-admin/import/mt.php

The other importers are waiting to be ported to the new importer
framework and updated to use the latest API.  The Blogger, RSS, and MT
importers provide good examples of how the importers should be
structured.

http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/import/

The old-style importers still live at wp-admin/import-*.php.  Grab one
and update it.

Could we have a few volunteers post database dumps of some of these
other systems, for those of us who do not have any of these systems
installed to really test it out? A couple from each system would help
ensure that everything will not just be a WFM.

I would agree. I'm the Textpattern "patron" and have one TXP dump that I
have used to design an effective importer.  However, I could use a few more,
preferrably with convoluted situations surrouding them.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Gap for translators
Message-ID: <43849ABE.8090009@developer.bg>

Is it possible the translators to receive some time (for example a week) 
before the 2.0 release to finish their work (being sure no string will 
change meanwhile), package their non-English versions not in a hurry. 
This will both make translators' days (and especially around new 
releases - nights) easier and for first time will enables us to have 
english and non-English releases of WordPress at the same happy moment. 
I beg for this gap between code freeze and release, because the current 
situation forces translators to catch up and hurry in the days after the 
official release. As a side note - this routine is present in many big 
projects (as far as I know - Gnome, KDE...).

Please, if somebody is powerful enough to make this desicion and really 
makes it, it should be announced in the wp-polyglots list.

Thank you in advance,
Nikolay

Whilst I have no involvement in the translation work, advance notice of the
upcoming release sounds like a good idea. This will also allow those
involved in documentation and support to look over to check that things are
clear.

I was thinking it would be a good idea to include a simple robots.txt

wp-admin, wp-includes, and wp-content directories.

Aren't we redirecting everything in index.php now? Make it a rewrite
rule: if robots.txt exists, use it, otherwise output something reasonable.

Not everyone installs WordPress at the top level either. The implication of
multiple robots.txt files would be user confusion. I suggest prepending to the
top of each administration page e.g.

<META HTTP-EQUIV="CACHE-CONTROL" CONTENT="NO-CACHE">
<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX,NOFOLLOW">

I personally think this whole discussion is a moot point. Maybe we
should throw a blank index.php file into wp-content to make sure that
robots can't get a directory listing, but other than that, there isn't
any information a robot would gain from spidering, other than a
WordPress login page. If users feel the need to protect themselves
more, they can add their own robots.txt.

Message-ID: <BAY109-DAV14220216EB1F9961C9AB7190570@phx.gbl>

Hi there,

I just tried out the WordPress 2 Beta 1 and the new
interface style looks very nice. :)

Then I looked a little bit around in the source code
to figure out how the AJAX request and fade effects
were realized. 

Unfortunately I had to see that you are using custom 
classes to do such "common" effects. That makes
plugin development harder if you have to deal
with them on plugin options pages for example.

Why not rely on well known, stable libraries
like script.aculo.us and prototype? There are
a lot of developers who already worked with 
them and adapted to functions like "$" which
replaces the document.getElementById.

So it would be very nice if future versions
of WordPress ship script.aculo.us and 
prototype with them.


Best regards,

  Theodor Ramisch

While I don't know the answer to this, I might point out that WordPress
opted NOT to use the "common" XML-RPC libraries and by doing so, avoided
having thousands of blogs vulnerable to an exploit a few weeks ago.  Mob
tendencies, while often nice for developers, aren't always a good thing.

I'd say that learning to use the libraries that WordPress is using
won't be that hard. I mean you learnt to use the plugin API as
well, no? its not similar to other blogging systems if I'm not
wrong, so why the fuss over the client-side API? its not mandatory
afterall, you can take it as an expansion to the plugin API if you
want & learn it if you want to make use of it in your blog, else you
can just leave it.

yeah well, you can say that!! :) every coin has two sides. ;) using a

So, I'm setting in on my next big WP project.

I've been running a forum now for a little bit and, to say the least, 
have been annoyed at the difficulty with which it takes to update/modify 
this hunker (and punbb isn't even that heavy).

This got me thinking, "gosh, I wish this had the Wordpress API -- it's 
totally awesome for simple patches and fixes." This, in turn, got me to 
thinking, "well, gee, couldn't I just turn WP _into_ a forum?"

I've been pondering this for a few weeks now and have started on 
development[1], but here's my aim:

"Utilizing Themes and Plugins, transform Wordpress into forum software."

I thought I might hit up the list for suggestions or ideas. I did some 
googling to see if this had been tried (outside of bbPress) but only 
found things like merging user tables, or including forum software as a 
plugin.

I figure, Wordpress (2.0, that is) has most of what is needed and the 
rest is just a matter of formatting (themes) and some functionality 
(plugins):

  - Topics == Posts
  - Replies == Comments
  - Users == Er, users
  - Profiles == Author Pages

And plugins could provide optional "on top" functionality like
  - Subscribe to forum/thread via email
  - Avatar support
  - More User Meta
  - Image Upload (sorta already built in)
  - Signatures
  - Polls
  - ... and other things - a lot of which already has some sort of WP 
Plugin made!


Anywho, just looking for some input about the idea.

What about bbPress? - http://bbpress.org/

I believe it is very similar in design and aims to WordPress / What you 
want.  The main thing it is probably missing at the moment from a quick 
scan of the code is plugin hooks

Yes, bbPress would be very good for this, its what powers the WP.org
forums and shares a good bit of code with WordPress, so you might want
to look into that

QFE: I already mentioned "outside of bbPress".

I don't think there *needs* to be a separate code base to do this.

Exactly. Let's not forget that less commonly-used libraries, e.g. homebred
implementations, even with flawed security, are less unlikely to have their
vulnerabilities exploited.

There are exceptions nonetheless. There used to be many 'in-the-wild' viruses
for RISCOS despite it being a scarce minority. The platform suffered despite
claims such as the ROM-based O/S making immune to trojans. Then again, we see
cases where Sony's rootkit is maliciously 're-used' by malice. Obscurity is
valuable in the context of security.

well, there was a theme for the WP1.5 theme competition that Alex King 
ran,
that theme was called something like 'Forumed', I'm not sure but it gave 
a
WordPress blog the look of a forum. maybe that can be your starting 
point,
since the post was displayed as the thread starting topic in that & all
comments to that post looked like the replies!!

Message-ID: <d4d3e29e0511290158w7def2e6dq16b358f47e738be9@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

As an wordpress i18n hacker , I would like to suggest to add some
flexibility to current installation proccess, something like what exists as
action_hooks , but not that complex, I mean for some i18n porpuses it's
vital to add some action_hooks in install proccess, I mean it would be great
to include some"fixed name files" in install php.

If the files exist in specefic folder (like
wp-includes/languages/xx/install) they would be included!

Imagine that for some i18n purposes it's vital to activate some plugins
through the setup... It's better than a patch? isn't it?

Before blindly mailing random mailing lists, it's perhaps a good idea to
take a look at where it is that you're posting. This is a mailing list for
those interested in extending or developing with WordPress, and not a
information security resource.

As much as I like the word hacker, I fear it sometimes gives the wrong
impression...

Not to mention, I highly doubt somebody with your obvious caliber in
"security" skills would be hired by infosec, and in the odd event that
you were, I do hope that your boss reconsiders your appointment, as
you obviously haven't a clue.

We can move the code that creates the first post, page, etc. to a
create_defaults() function that can be replaced by a function of the
same name loaded from wp-includes/languages/xx/install-functions.php.

Maybe to not add a new dir level the file should be named
xx_XX_install-functions.php that will be distributed with locales .mo

This flexible installer would be useful for more than just il8n folks.  It
would also prove extremely helpful for folks who maintain a wide variety of
WP installs on different servers for different folks.

So, if I want every site I create to have Spam Karma, WP-Contact and 4 other
plugins installed, activated and configured a particular way, the
create_defaults() function could go along way towards this goal.

I was going to create a custom WP distro for myself that would address this
need, but it makes much more sense to have the guts of the "roll your own"
subsystem as part of the core.  Then, everyone can take advantage of the
toolset.

Not to mention this would make it much much easier to
publish your own "plugged in" versions of Wordpress -
like Alex King does:

Yep.  Another consideration is the prevention of project forking. I've been
down that road with other OS projects.  People spin off independent projects
which are really unnecessary and create more noise, less signal, when the
issue could have been addressed by by accounting for custom distros within
the core.

This way, the core grows in a solid, predictable way and you do not end up
with 50 ill-conceived forks which are really just ugly, inefficient hacks,
on top of hacks on top of even more hacks.  You get the picture. :D

Baking "roll-your-own" into the core will keep WP strong for years to come
by keeping everyone on a common codebase while allowing for custom distros.
If/when forks happen, they will only be because the devs think something
substantive in the core must change, not because Dev X got his/her nose out
of joint because his plug-in was not moved to the core.

I'm open to either style.  If we start adding other files, we might want
a directory.

For such semi-custom installs, we probably don't want to tie our file
load to a locale.  It may make the most sense to just load
wp-content/install-functions.php instead of digging in the languages
directory.  install-functions.php will be used once, at install time,
and thereafter will be useless.  It is a prepackaged, one-shot item.

So, this is me trying to understand. I'd package my
Wordpress with this "install-functions.php" file in
the wp-content directory. It would contain all of the
functions that I wanted run when Wordpress gets
installed. I could leave the file there and not worry
about it, since it would only run once. The creation
of the db tables and the insert of the default post
comment - would that still run? I guess the best thing
would be to have a way to know each thing that is done
on install, and then to have the option of doing it or
not doing it. I don't know what all happens when you
first install, but it's got to set the default
options, too?

Will bbpresss integrate with the WP users table?   That is the worst part of
any OSS integration, getting to a single sign-on (SSO) for a common user
table.

Sorry, slightly OT, but this has been a real timesaver for us:

Just wanted to share w/ the group how we're managing over 24 different
installations of WordPress - on theoretically different servers.

We ended up creating a Subversion trunk with stock WordPress 1.5.2 +
all the plugins that we need (added as needed); I think we're up to
15-20+ plugins.

We don't include the wp-config.php, of course, but everything else,
including themes... is shared.  (hard-disk space is cheap these days,
eh? =)

In retrospect, symlink may have been a better friend.

With this setup, though... in theory, all installs can be on totally
different servers.

A little Expect + SSH + svn update magic, and the blogs are all
updated to our latest trunk / custom WP distro.  =)

Shanti

PS: I know, the deployment purists might be cringing right about now.  =)

I think discussing enhancements and architectural changes on the hackers
list before submitting to trac is a good policy.  In this case, I think
we're on to a good idea and should log it in trac.  I'll create a bug
report and put a link to this thread in it.

The parts we would make pluggable are the creation of the default
category, post, comment, page, and blogroll.  This happens after the db
schema is laid down and the options and roles are populated.  The custom
function could activate plugins and change options if it wanted too.

Would we want an example template for module devs so they could make their
modules "install-function" ready?  Or, would the current module
install/activation/config mechanisms suffice?

Does that make sense?

Subject: [wp-hackers] usermeta
Message-ID: <438D2ECB.4000600@skippy.net>

I'm looking at the usermeta stuff.  Do I read this correctly at line
2133 in functions.php:
        if ( '' == $meta_value )
                return false;

If the value is empty, don't update the value?  What if one _wants_ to
place an empty value in there?

But the real point is that I don't see a delete_usermeta() function
anywere.  Once I add in a meta value, how do I delete it?  I'm not
opposed to making a SQL query myself, but it seems like an omission to
require users to do this.

I actually noticed along these lines last night (but didn't investigate
it further).  If the value in a custom field is 0 (zero) then the field
is never added.

I added delete_usermeta().  Please test.

I'll look into the other issue.

Message-ID: <A575D6EB-6E7D-4C91-82D6-640AB3DBD828@cloudthirteen.com>

I wanted to expand the templating engine with this idea I have.     
Whenever there is a place where WordPress is generating a piece of  
content, such as with wp_list_cats, you can add a class name to the  
parameter list, so each category will  belong to the class you  
specified.

Is this something that can be a module, or is this something that has  
to be done to the main branch of wordpress, also is this a good idea?
