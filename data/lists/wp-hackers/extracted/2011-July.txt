hello :)

question for wordpress core developers: have you considered the
feature that wordpress will auto update automatically in the
background? In the way, that blog admin dont have to even log into
wp-admin. If new version of wordpress is available, will be silently
installed.

Thats my small idea in those days when many software is going thiss
way (chrome, firefox...). :)

I've got a hunch that this wouldn't be feasible/likely to happen in the near
future, due to plugin compatibility issues. I agree that it would be nice,
but there'd likely be quite an uproar ("you broke my site!!!1!!11!!"), even
though the actual root of the problem would be bad/no longer developed
plugins.

This is a little harder than one might think..
For example, users who rely on FTP Upgrades would need to store their FTP
credentials somewhere WordPress could access them, not a good move IMO.
Not only that, but not all plugins are compatible, yadda yadda, it's a
complidated situation and not as straight forward as it is for desktop
applications.. Web Applications are running in restrictive environments
which have umpteen different configurations.

It's not something I expect you'll see in core anytime soon, however, with
some improvements in 3.2, I can see a plugin offering point-release updates
(ie. 3.2 => 3.2.1, or 3.2.1 => 3.2.2) not that difficult at all and quite
seemless.. Watch out, you've got me thinking, I'll be trying out a proof of
concept plugin on that once 3.2.1 is released (as there'll be a point
release to test with then..)

Anything like this should definitely be an "opt-in" feature.

A plug-in that sends me an email telling me "Yo dude important update,
come visit me at http://www.mydom.com/wp-admin" would be preferred.
Yeah, it would mean several dozen emails in the in-basket. But, I
don't mind.

I have a few plug-ins that I need to wait a day or two after an wp
update for notice that all is clear before updating. That's only a few
out of a couple dozen sites. But, if those sites were suddenly broken
by a fully auto update, that would not be good.

But yeah, have my wp sites complain through email until I either
update or tell them to stop.

Just my 2cents.

Actually, Firefox has quite a large footprint when it comes to downloading
updates.  But the way Chrome updates in the background is fantastic.  I've
always been a fan, and I love the idea of continuously keeping my website
up-to-date (which is why I run bleeding edge nightlies in production).

I've got a hunch that this wouldn't be feasible/likely to happen in the
> near future, due to plugin compatibility issues.


This is a fair argument against the idea and one of the most valid I've
heard so far.  Considering the standard process of updating is to deactivate
plugins, update WordPress, then re-activate plugins and fix any problems
that come up, it would become problematic to script.  Say WP 3.X installs
just fine, but Awesome Plugin 2000 wasn't updated to use a new API and
breaks on re-activation.  Do you just leave the plugin alone and alert the
site owner?  Do you roll back the entire update and alert the site owner?
 If any kind of continuous update process is considered, this is something
that needs to be addressed.

This is a little harder than one might think..
> For example, users who rely on FTP Upgrades would need to store their FTP credentials
> somewhere WordPress could access them, not a good move IMO.


This is already something they need to consider for automated theme/plugin
installation and the one-click updater.  Either you store credentials in
wp-config.php or manually enter them every time.  Not the best argument.

It's not something I expect you'll see in core anytime soon


Doesn't need to be in core from the beginning.  I would love to see this as
a plugin, so those of us who like to "live on the edge" could use it to
break our sites.  Really, anyone who's using `svn up` on a cron is
essentially already doing this anyway.  It's just a matter of making that
possible for people who have no idea what my last sentence meant.  Not every
WordPress user, beta tester, or fanatic is a version control wizard.  Any
many people using inexpensive shared hosting can't run command line tools or
cron jobs like that anyway.

But yeah, have my wp sites complain through email until I either update or
> tell them to stop.


If you follow any of the core team on Twitter, subscribe to any major
WordPress blogs, or ever visit the WordPress Stack Exchange, you're going to
be nagged from several directions until you update.  The idea of building a
continuous release system into WordPress is so that you don't *need* to go
to the dashboard to update.

For updates, there are a few particular things I'd like to accomplish by the
end of 2011. Here's two:

One, my installation should email me when there is an update to core. It
should, in the process, let me know if there's any plugins or themes out of
date. This should target the admin email address.

Two, I'd like to release a plugin that, as a working proof of concept,
handles point release updates in the background, provided the site is
configured correctly.

I am installing my first WP site on a NGINX platform, that was build by the client IT department and am getting this error.

Warning: Creating default object from empty value in /var/www/blog/wp-admin/includes/post.php on line 421

Should I be worried, or should I just hide it.

Actually it should target the email address of Administrators and we should deprecate the admin_email option.

And we should do similar things to the other emails we send - target them based on a role / capability.

But please make it all hookable.  Imagine what it will be like for the person managing 20+ or even 100+ sites for clients.  It will be like their birthday (where every site and company that's ever gotten their birthday emails them happy birthday) except it will be non-stop email for every site!

Regardless of auto-updating, I think adding in support for (manually)

Message-ID: <463c9a09-8063-48a6-96fa-9223198fca61@5g2000yqb.googlegroups.com>

I have about 2000 blogs running on a WP 3.0.1 install, and we get
roughly 15-20 million pageviews a month across all the blogs. We rely
on wp-cron to do normal things like publish scheduled posts, delete
old items from the trash, etc... We also use wp-cron to schedule other
events, like the wp-super-cache garbage collection mechanism, and a
custom page view counter plugin that we wrote.

I'm noticing that on a number of our higher traffic blogs, we are
getting a ton of duplicate data in the "cron" row in our blog options
tables. For example, here is a piece of the serialized array in one of
our blogs:

Notice that wp_version_check and other entries appear multiple times.
Is this the expected behavior? It seems to be causing a ton of extra
load to be placed on our servers, and I'm wondering how I can go about
fixing the issue.

I have heard that simply deleting this row from the table periodically
could help, but that doesn't seem like a good long term solution.

Thanks for your help,

Not sure why your option is being polluted with duplicate information, but I recommend removing version checks. Multi-site does lots of redundant version checks because there isn't a network-wide wp-cron. 

remove_action('init', 'wp_schedule_update_checks'); // don't schedule update checks

Okay, I can do that, but I guess that doesn't really resolve the issue
of duplicate entries getting in there. Would it be valid to delete
that row once a day?

This function does not appear in my source code because I'm only on
3.1. I guess I'll have to wait to make that change.

Any other thoughts on how my cron options rows are getting so crazy
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Nacin, I think does the trick but would need to be cleaned up before it was released live. I run it on my own sites to check for updates every 12 hours and email me once a week if there is an update pending.

function thisismyurl_check_update() {
	if (!get_transient('_site_transient_update_core_timer')) {
		wp_version_check();
		set_transient( '_site_transient_update_core_timer', true, (60*60*12));

Deleting things outright is bad. Try cleaning it up first. Then maybe
you can find what's adding the extra entries.

I like the WP-Crontrol plugin for managing what's happening in my cron.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-crontrol/

Works fine in 3.2. Activate then go to Tools->Crontrol to see what
jobs are there.

Well, actually, just now looking at it, I see it causes a few minor
warnings in 3.2. Probably needs an update. But it seems to work okay
despite that.

Kind of a long way around to do it, really. Better to use the
get/set_site_transient functions instead of using the _site_transient_
prefix yourself.

Also, you can just hook to the set_site_transient_update_core and take
your action then. That way, your code only runs when the core update
check actually occurs. Something like this:

add_action('set_site_transient_update_core', 'demo');

function demo() {
  $update_core = get_site_transient('update_core');
 ?if (... stuff here to check $update_core->updates array ...) {
     wp_mail(...);
  }
}

If only we had things like email filters to manage a sudden influx of
identical-looking mail. :-)

Of course it'd be hookable. I'd expect a profile-based opt-out.

Thanks. Having the hooks needed for a plugin installed on each of the many managed sites that would allow the plugin to locally intercept the notices and then aggregate them on to a central WordPress install using a different plugin would be all we need.

Firefox says they'll be doing Chrome style auto-updates within the next

If you've never read about it, it's pretty interesting how Chrome does

Thanks Otto, much cleaner! get_site_transient() makes a lot more sense to
use in this case.

For in-branch partial build updates, we're sending full files, but now
they're trivially small. Updating from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3 required the download
of a 3.1 MB zip and the moving of more than 900 files. Under the partial
build scenario, that same update would have been 78kb and 10 files.

That's 2% of the size and 1% of the I/O. Smaller is faster, and safer too.

Hide it.

We should have a $post = new stdClass; there (ticket/patch welcome), but PHP
will handle it just fine.

hello list,

i am using wordpress since 2 years without any trouble, update  
regulary , but last friday, i got a mail from my hoster
that someone "uploaded" a phishing script into my "upload folder"  
after i found out that the "contact form" module might cause
the problem because i allways found a "wpcf7_captcha" directory in my  
"upload folder , i removed the module and all when fine.

Today i ve got another mail from rsa.com  that the same script is  
still on my site just in a "theme" folder.
I  looked into the installed "phishing script"   http://www.2shared.com/file/M9zwMVr5/www1royalbankcom.html
it seems everything is loaded from https://www1.royalbank.com/  for  
example
https://www1.royalbank.com/common/images/english/logo_rbc_rb.gif  <  
but this is not the original banking site !!

Is this a DNS manipulation ? https://www1.royalbank.com <  ??? when i  
try http://www.royalbank.com it redirects me to the original banking  
site at

http://www.rbcroyalbank.com  !!!!

After  i searched for some information , i found this on the full  
disclosure list , and i am a bit  concerned now....

The Hackers list is not the first, or best, audience for this type of
message. You should email security at wordpress.org directly if you believe you
have discovered evidence of a vulnerability or an exploit vector.

Also, be sure to read the Hardening WordPress entry in the Codex:

I missed this discussion previously, so sorry for bumping, but I thought
it was worth noting Firefox's process for this:

http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2011/04/19/add-on-compatibility-rapid-releases/

As far as I know, that's all done automatically. It'd be awesome to try
and do this for WordPress as well. The easiest way I can think of doing
it is to search for any APIs we've changed in the plugin files. If we
detect that a plugin uses those APIs, we can either mark it as
incompatible straight away, or do some better API compatibility
checking. The latter would be preferable, but I'm not sure how easy it
would be (most likely, we're going to have to run the plugin, or do
complicated stuff with the tokenizer, and neither of those sound
appealing to me).

Automatic updates are something I'm planning to try in my own software,
so I'll see how that goes.

Morning all,

I just updated one of my plugins, http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pages-children/. The information, version, etc. for the plugin updated corrected. But the 'Last Updated' date still shows 2011-01-23. 

As far as I'm aware this is not something I directly control via the plugin PHP or readme.txt file. Anyone else seeing this issue?

Thoughts?

Message-ID: <CAGcUGA9PN6eHuGw98WCgTJ0D77b8f-EB4=9fVVn79DnPTY-n1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm using "Theme my login" plugin to move in front-end all the
features concerning login, registration, password recovery, etc.
The language of admin area is italian (unfortunately my customer
doesn't know english :-/) but the website should be entirely in
english (it's an international social network).
In order to do so also the error messages (login failed, etc.) should
be in english but now they are of the same language of admin area, so
in italian.

How can I force WordPress to display these messages only in english?
Is there a solution different from to select english as admin area language?

I hope I was clear.

Thanks

I have not tested it, but something like this may work.

if ( is_admin() ) {
	function foo_change_admin_locale() {
		return 'it_IT';
	}
	add_filter('locale', 'foo_change_admin_locale');
}

True but other people have also been seeing this problem recently over
much longer time periods:

The Language Switcher plugin[1] allows you to select your admin are
language from the languages you have available. It should do the
trick.

Hi Andrew,

I'm using your plugin for know how to handle post types, but it seems is 
unable to get the translations in post screens too. I see there are some 
mods for not show some aspects, etc but I tried in remaining buttons and 
labels around and the translation just don't reach anything. If I change 
your code for display a whole editing screen, translation still doesn't 
work.

I'm waiting for bbPress to see how this is handled there.

No worries. Thanks Otto. I did find some other sites mentioning making sure the readme.txt is UTF-8 and other 'techniques'. At the time this morning tried all. But just checked the date and now seems to be correct. Thanks.

Not sure I get the question fully, or if it should be discussed on the
polyglot's blog[1], but the way bbPress (plugin) does it is the way
any well behaved plugin should, i.e. it loads a language file for its
own textdomain[2], uses internationalized strings with that
textdomain[3], which can be translated from a .pot file, specific to
that plugin.

If, on the other hand, those custom post types are being defined by a
theme's functions.php file, the process is only different in that the
file should load the textdomain for the *theme* [4], and said theme
should have its own .pot file.

In short, individual custom post types are not a part of core and
hence those strings do not exist on core's .pot files

Also, AFAICT, the Log Deprecated plugin isn't loading a textdomain at
all, nor are its calls to __(), _e(), et al, using one. It doesn't
even have a .pot file (although it's easy enough to create one).

Not sure which deprecated log plugin you are talking about. I'm talking 
about this one http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/ 
made by Nacin Last Updated: 2011-2-9.

Line 134 says:
load_plugin_textdomain('log-deprecated', null, dirname( plugin_basename( 
__FILE__ ) ) . '/languages/' );

Mine (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ada-plugin/) has everything i18n, 
but the translations never reach the post type screen. Contextual Help 
works, but the labels in edit screen, no, nada.

I'm surprised no-one pointed this out straight away... It's something I've
accidentally done before, infact, It looks like Log Deprecated Calls may
even have this problem too

You're registering your post types before you're telling WordPress to load
your translations. You need to load your translations before registering the
post type/taxonomies.


Furthermore, You should really not be running any of that code before the
init action IMO.. The only core functions you should call before init are
add_action() and add_filter()

You may want to add a priority to your items as well, for example:
add_action('init', 'myplugin_load_translations', 1);
add_action('init', 'myplugin_various_items', 10/* default is 10*/);

And while i'm at it, Do you really need to handle back-compat with old
versions of WordPress using WP_PLUGINS_URL etc?  You shouldn't even be using
those constants anymore, and instead using plugins_url() (eg: $url =
plugins_url('css/myfile.css', __FILE__); )

However, I just realised I suggested something very silly then. If you don't
need to load your plugins textdomain on the front end, as many wouldn't,
it's probably worth skipping loading it... For example, i'd perhaps try this
(completely untested)

add_action('init', 'myplugin_various_items', 10/* default is 10*/); //
Register the post type for the front end, will get a English string
add_action('admin_init', 'myplugin_load_translations', 5 /* Register the
textdomain before the post type is included*/ );
add_action('admin_init', 'myplugin_various_items', 10/* default is 10*/);
// Reregister post type, this time, with translated strings

You could probably also return early in myplugin_load_translations() if !
is_admin() too, theres half a dozen different ways around this..

Thanks Hulse, I don't undertand too much about all this, quite adapted the 
plugin from many sources.

I think your note on priority can be helpful (no tested yet).
I don't understand how register post is being loaded before anything or the 
post types are always handled firstly, by default !?

I'm surprised no-one pointed this out straight away... It's something I've
accidentally done before, infact, It looks like Log Deprecated Calls may
even have this problem too

You're registering your post types before you're telling WordPress to load
your translations. You need to load your translations before registering the
post type/taxonomies.


Furthermore, You should really not be running any of that code before the
init action IMO.. The only core functions you should call before init are
add_action() and add_filter()

You may want to add a priority to your items as well, for example:
add_action('init', 'myplugin_load_translations', 1);
add_action('init', 'myplugin_various_items', 10/* default is 10*/);

And while i'm at it, Do you really need to handle back-compat with old
versions of WordPress using WP_PLUGINS_URL etc?  You shouldn't even be using
those constants anymore, and instead using plugins_url() (eg: $url =
plugins_url('css/myfile.css', __FILE__); )

My apologies, It looks like i've misread the code, It's hard skimming code
where indentation isn't consistent.
The post type isn't being registered before init, it's being registered on
init.

However, The post type structure,
http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ada-plugin/trunk/creation/pet_post_type.php?rev=404248#L14IS
being run on plugin inclusion basically.. It's creating the $labels
array
before the language files are loaded, so __(something, 'ADA') is returning
'something' since at that point in time, the translations functions havn't
been loaded..

So;
 * PETPostType() is run at plugin inclusion time, this sets the labels and
attemptt to translate them (and fails);
 * Then on init, adafunc_setup() is called loading the translations.
 * And then, on init again, PETPostType::register() is called, registering
the post type, with the previously "untranslated" strings from step 1.

That combined with the priorities, should be able to get you on the right
line.. Make sense?

Tried the priority and still no changes. Also, the metabox script never get 
translated, I think some problem there.

I tried to move the
    $PETPostType = new PETPostType();
    $LOSTPostType = new LOSTPostType();
For their "respective" file, but no luck.

Pasted in pastebin http://pastebin.com/Zwj0akPX

You can also check this administration plugin to get your backend interface
into your prefered language.
There are several options how to permit a user specific backend language.

The Language Switcher plugin[1] allows you to select your admin are
language from the languages you have available. It should do the
trick.

You are loading your translation at the init hook processing but your
constructor for PETPostType executes before loading your translation file
inside the plugin class constructor. So any translation stands at english
while translation is missing.

You have 2 options:
	a) load your translation directly in front of your constructor
executions. (not recommended)
	b) hook into init hook execution, load the textdomain and 2nd define
now the posttype objects.

Thank you very much guys.

Plugins Language Switcher WordPress Plugin could be a good solution.

I have just a doubt: doing some testing on admin area language I've
realized that the language of error messages is the same of admin area
one, so I suppose that the only way to change the language of these
messages is to change the language of admin area.
Especially because error or warning messages are displayed by default
by WordPress and not by other plugins.

Is it correct or am I wrong?

Anyway I will try to drop language constant definition in
wp-config.php (or wp-settings.php, now I don't remeber) and to follow
some of our suggestions. After that I will report on this thread the
result and the solution.

For the moment, thank you very much.

Hi all,

maybe I've forgotten to say one important detail: my website is
multilingual and to manage this feature I'm using WPML plugin.
So I already have a plugin that manages the language of both front-end
and admin area.

I've set as front-end language English and as admin area language
Italian and now all seems to works fine.

Thank you very much for your support.

Sorry for asking this over here. I just can't login to the wp.org Forums.

I'm searching for the link where I can change the wordpress.org password and

Any help would be highly appreciated.

You could try the 'the_post' hook which fires at the beginning of each
iteration of the loop. It's called by the_post() so anything you
output during that hook will be placed where your call to that
function is.

Thanks Heiko, (thanks also for Codestyling plugin, I love that!)

I tried the a) load the translation directly in front of constructor 
executions, and didn't work. Again, translation only in some parts. About 
b), not sure how that should be, but I wil try.

Also, I tried to use differente events from init for post types, with no 
sucess. Translation always work, but only for some parts :(

Maybe is better to merge the post type files into a single file?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Why meta noindex nofollow only in one page?
Message-ID: <CAGcUGA8cBaociYXTLTPwUGvHq4jzWa9F8T03NcEThL58pvqTEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've created a page that I want render using a custom template so I've
created a file called page-home.php that implements a custom template
for the home page.
Unfortunately only in this page the metatag noindex nofollow is
displayed, why? What could be the reason?
To load the header I simply call get_header() function.

Thanks

Oooh, fail. Would probably make sense to move the load_plugin_textdomain()
to init, but wrap it in an is_admin(). admin_init is definitely too late if
you've got a post type being registered on init. Thanks Dion.

If you're logged in, you should be able to change it here:
http://wordpress.org/support/profile/your_username/edit

Sort of off topic, but also, if you're into saving passwords, you should try
a manager like 1Password.

The settings are correct because the privacy level is "public".
Anyway I've solved in a raw way surrounding in header.php file the
wp_head function with an if statement.

Thank you very much for your suggestion.

Thanks everybody for help, I solved this. I'm not really aware if the best 
way ever, but works:
http://pastebin.com/Z0nkLADq

I created a function, add all inits there and that's it. I think Reiko, 
Hulse Nacin said that, I just wan't getting. In fact everything was just 
hanging around the code, quite a silly thing.

If someone else point wrong things going in this solution, let me know.

Thanks again, sorry for any newbie nonsense!

Message-ID: <CAK3PZGv656S=3hohxBz3mkWgz6x3tTZqfOmEEf58Q+WTz9vA9Q@mail.gmail.com>

I tried an automatic upgrade of 3.2, and it was slightly rocky (.maintenance
had to be manually deleted).

I went to the update page, and clicked 'Reinstall' to make sure everything
was updated correctly, and it gave me the following error:

Downloading update from http://wordpress.org/download/wordpress-3.2.zip?

http://wordpress.org/download/wordpress-3.2.zip doesn't exist, but
http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.2.zip does. Not sure where this incorrect
URL is being referenced, but a copy of 3.2 should be placed in the right
place soon!

Subject: [wp-hackers] contextual tag cloud (filtering with tags and boolean
	AND)
Message-ID: <4E12C921.4050608@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on creating a contextual tagcloud widget. This is more or
less based on the default WordPress tagcloud except for:

1) The tags should be shown contextually. Meaning if the user selected a
tag and gets a result. The tagcloud will be updated and show only the
tags which have been used in the results. By doing this the widget
limits the possible tags to those which provide a new set of results
_within_ the current set. In other words the tag(s) function as a
boolean AND filter

2) The tags link should take any already selected tag(s) into
consideration and built it's permalink including the selected tag(s) in
such a way that it will become a boolean AND. In practice this means
tags will be delimited with a plus sign in the url.

Are there any plugins or widgets already offering this functionality?
Any hints, tips in making this widget? Currently my approach tends to
focus on getting the object ids from the results and based on this
retrieve the term ids to pass to wp_tag_cloud's include parameter.

Ps: Congratulations to all who made 3.2 a reality!

I've started to format the code of older files to make them WP coding 
standard compliant. The codex says that there should be spaces at round 
brackets:

function( parameter ) {}

but it does not say anything about square brackets. So what's the 
preferred style?

$_POST['link_url']
or
$_POST[ 'link_url' ]

Should be $_POST['link_url']. That said, if it were a variable, then it
should probably have spaces: $_POST[ $link_url ].

There are much more useful ways to contribute than creating huge patches for whitespace / coding style issues.

The Coding Standards are guidelines for the development of new code and do not need retroactive application en-mass pieces of code are updated as they are edited to fix bugs / add new features.

After reading this I looked at the Codex again and saw that it's not 
explained for round brackets neither. In the code there are both 
versions

---
current_user_can('edit_posts')
do_action( 'in_admin_footer' );
---

(copied and pasted from the core code).

To be consistent these should be written without spaces if it's a pure 
string and with spaces if it's a variable. What if it's a mixture, like 
function('string', $var); I would vote for spaces.

I didn't want a long dicussion but after I started this I can't stop

Didn't want to do it for every file just did it for one since I was 
changing spacing for a function anyway because it was horrible to read 
and to understand and as I finished I thought I could do it for the 
whole file, wasn't much more work.

For parentheses, spaces are in order. But as Peter said (as well as others
in the ticket), we have some standards when it comes to refactoring:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Conditionals not working properly when trying to
	filter admin_footer_text
Message-ID: <4E139FF5.20901@kpdesign.net>

I'm trying to filter the admin footer text just for the Subscriber role 
using admin_footer_text.

I'm using conditionals to target Subscribers and version 3.2. The code 
I'm using is:

---------------------------------------------------------

function my_custom_admin_footer_text() {
     global $blog, $blog_id, $current_user, $custom_footer_text, $id, 
$wp_db_version;

     $custom_footer_text = '<span id="footer-thankyou">'.__('Powered by 
<a title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>').'</span>';

     /* Let's change the footer text for Subscribers in WordPress 3.2 or 
higher */

     if ((!current_user_can('edit_posts') || 
!current_user_can_for_blog($blog_id, 'edit_posts')) && $wp_db_version >= 
18226) {
         echo $custom_footer_text;
     }

}

add_filter('admin_footer_text', 'my_custom_admin_footer_text');

---------------------------------------------------------

The results are:

- In version 3.1, for all roles, the footer text for every role is 
getting whacked completely, rather than displaying the default footer 
text from admin-footer.php. Conditional indicates db version is WP 3.2 
or higher, so 3.1 shouldn't get touched.

- In version 3.2, the footer text is being replaced for Subscribers, but 
is whacked completely for all other roles.

Is there an issue with using conditionals when trying to filter 
admin_footer_text? If not, any ideas on why the above code isn't 
functioning properly?

Thanks in advance.

"admin_footer_text" is a filter which means you should return
$custom_footer_text instead of echoing it. This will explain the
behaviour you're seeing.

Thanks for the response John. I tried making the change you suggested, 
but no love - the results are the same.

In all of the examples I found on the web where people were trying to 
change that text, they applied the change to all roles, rather than 
limiting it to a specific role - none of them used conditionals.

Any other ideas on what may be happening?

As John pointed out you need to return the footer text in your 
function. In your code you're returning nothing if the condition is not 
fulfilled. You have to use the standard footer text as a parameter for 
the function and return this text if the condition is not fulfilled.


This function should work:

function my_custom_admin_footer_text($footer_text) {
     global $blog, $blog_id, $current_user, $custom_footer_text, $id, 
$wp_db_version;

     $custom_footer_text = '<span id="footer-thankyou">'.__('Powered 
by<a title="WordPress" 
href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>').'</span>';

     /* Let's change the footer text for Subscribers in WordPress 3.2 or 
higher */

     if ((!current_user_can('edit_posts') || 
!current_user_can_for_blog($blog_id, 'edit_posts'))&&  $wp_db_version>=
18226) {
         return $custom_footer_text;
     }

     else {
       return $footer_text;
    }
}

I was looking over the twentyeleven theme, and I saw if you added the search
widget to the sidebar it has the same id as the one in the header
id="searchform"

You should really only have 1 id per element, any thoughts on this?

Hi Fris,

Consider creating a ticket in Trac for this, preferably with a patch :)

Message-ID: <CAAiY+byXLtGX0H+z7x-n0QF1yZ-uhB4-fb+PNaL715eGJzs5KA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have got my first plugin ready to go and it has been approved. However i
am now completely flumoxed by how to actually add it to the directory! I
have not used SVN before and am struggling with it TBH. I have added my
plugin to /trunk and then tried various ways of copying it to /tags/0.1 none
of which worked and now i cant delete /tags/0.1... ARGH!

I am getting all sorts of weird errors now. I believe i have well and truly
messed it up. I did read through all i could find on this but the Wp site
inparticular seems to assume you have knowledge of SVN which i dont. Could
someone please point me in the right direction? I just want to know how to
get my plugin in the directory! It shouldnt be this hard!

Also is there a way i can start again with my repository? I would rather
start again once i know what im doing.

Did anyone else struggle with this?? Its made me feel really stupid!

Thank you

Andy

What software do you use to commit your stuff on SVN ?

If you use TortoiseSVN, there is a feature "Branch/Tag" which allows you to
easy create a new tag of your trunk.

So you have to commit your trunk folder, then create a new tag by clicking
on "Branch/Tag" in the right click menu on trunk, and that's it.

Anyway, if your tag 0.1 is wrong and can't delete it, you can also create a
new tag, and specify into your readme that there is a new tag version.

I published a tutorial a few weeks ago that walks you through the steps to
creating and committing a plugin complete with screenshots from TortoiseSVN.
 If you're on a Mac, I have it on good authority that you can use SCPlugin
instead and follow the exact same steps.

http://mindsharestrategy.com/2011/how-to-publish-a-wordpress-plugin-subversion/

Basically, you develop on trunk until you're ready to release, then you use
SVN to create your tag - don't try to move things to the /tags folder
manually, because you might accidentally copy the .svn subdirectories ...
and that can break things.

Hi all,

A related question: How do you just update the readme.txt so that the 
"Tested up to: 3.2" line can be updated? It seems silly to have to 
upgrade to a whole new version number just to change form 3.1.x to 
3.2 in the readme.txt.

I'm using SVNx. I committed the change yesterday, and it shows in the 
plugin log at http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/ but on the 
plugin page at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ still says 
"3.1.4" Thanks very much, Mike

Looked through "what" exactly?

The branch/tag option is in the contextual menu that pops up when you
right-click the folder.

The message list doesn't support attachments.

When you right-click on the folder, you should see a TortoiseSVN item in the
contextual menu.  The Branch/Tag option is in there.

Here's a screenshot directly from the TortoiseSVN site:
http://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/images/ContextMenuDirControl.png

If your on a Mac (never quite sure if people are using Mac or Windows), the
SCPlugin menu is slightly different:
http://scplugin.tigris.org/images/contextual_menu.png  But you see
"Copy/Tag" in the menu there as well.

I was actually talking about Versions, as im on a mac.


Just so you know, stating you can't find a menu I mentioned when you're not
even using the software I was talking about doesn't help either of us.  I
can't give Versions advice since I'm not on a Mac and have no experience
with it ... but I have been told that SCPlugin works the same as
TortoiseSVN, which is why I recommended that and linked to the tutorial.

I keep getting messages like this


> Commit failed (details follow): access to

With that commit failure message, I'm wondering how you checked out the
repository in the first place.  It almost looks like you're trying to commit
to a specific changeset rather than to the repository in general.  Can you
explain the steps you used to checkout for us?  If you used a specific
tutorial, can you link to that as well?

Eric, of course i didnt know you were talking about a different piece of
software. Im not an idiot. You replied to a response of mine to someone
saying they use versions. In fact you are the one talking about software out
of context.

I hate trying to ask for help on here. I always get a smarmy response from
someone.

This is the definitive source for information about svn.  I encourage you to
read sections 1-4 and 9 if you really want to understand how to use svn.

I would also encourage you to learn to use it from the command line rather
then any of the GUI tools.  The #svn channel on freenode can also be a good
source.

Not trying to be smarmy.  I posted a tutorial and tried to help, someone
else replied "I use Versions and love it", you responded with "I looked
through that but couldn't find the branch/tag option."  I assumed (my fault)
that you were referencing the advice and tips I'd given, not the "I like
Versions" comment.  My bad, really.

But I did do some more searching for you, and it doesn't look like Versions
supports a tag/branch feature.  Their help documentation for tagging is
quoted below:

To create a branch or tag, all you need to do is copying the entire trunk
folder over to a new subfolder in the branches or tags folder. The easiest
way to do this is to browse the repository (not the working copy) and make
such a copy there. That way, Subversion can take care of the actual copying,
instead of having to transfer the entire contents of the trunk to your local
working copy and sending it back to the server again.

There is no need to be concerned about disk space, Subversion is quite smart
about making copies. If two folders are nearly identical, Subversion will
only store just enough information to be able to reliably reconstruct the
files when you do a checkout or export.

It looks like, if you're sticking to Versions, you'll need to export the
trunk of your repository and copy it manually into the right subfolder of
/tags.  Not the best solution, but it does work.

That said, it still doesn't answer the question of why you're getting that
error message in the first place ... but without knowing how you checked
things out in the first place, there's not much more advice that we can
give.

Generally speaking, you simply make the change in both the trunk and
whatever is the current tagged directory. Then wait a while. Sometimes
it won't take immediately.

If I knew what plugin you're referring to, I could take a look.

I took a look at the repository directly, and I see the /0.2 folder in /tags
... things *look* fine on a first glance.  Is anything missing?

Here's the Trac log:
http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/wordpress-gallery/  It shows your most
recent commit as 32 minutes ago and all of the files seem to be there.

Okay, first, stop trying to do weird and strange things. Stop making
new folders and checking things in randomly.

If you're getting an access forbidden error, then it doesn't like your
username and password. Make sure that your username is using exactly
the same capitalization as your username actually has in it. Make sure
it's the same password on wordpress.org.

But most importantly *stop doing things when you have no idea what
you're doing*. Making new directories, checking in incorrect files.
Your SVN listing is all screwed up and it's no wonder it's not
working.

Stop. Sit down. Set up your local directory the way it should be.
Delete the extraneous crap folders you've created for no reason. Once
you have it set up correctly, then commit it.

-Otto

Hi Otto,

Thank you for checking this. 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ultimate-category-excluder/ I'm 
sure you're right, and I only updated one file and not the other. Mike

Okay. Now that we're settled, here's the problems:

http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wordpress-gallery/tags/0.2/wordpress-gallery.php
has version 0.1 in it. Shouldn't that be 0.2?

http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wordpress-gallery/tags/0.2/readme.txt
has Stable Tag 0.1 in it. Also should be 0.2.

Making a new tag = making a new version. If you didn't make a new
version, then you shouldn't have made a new tag directory.

Your checkin problems are straight username/password issues.

Yep. Your readme only says tested up to 3.1.2:
http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-category-excluder/tags/0.7/readme.txt

If you're using tagged versions, then the only part of
trunk/readme.txt that gets read is the Stable Tag. Everything else
comes from the tag directory.

I generally just follow the http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/ and http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/svn/ for updating and tagging 

And may be just me. You will get a lot out of SVN by learning the command line instead of trying to figure out to do things in some interface.

Message-ID: <CAP+Cxx2-mDeptuQbec_CE5796wXp35_OLQsXgRrzxdS2PR9C5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm currently working on a plugin that allows users to create posts from the
front-end (non-admin area). I've been using a non-tinyMCE jQuery Rich Text
solution, but for continuity, and my sanity once clients take over the data
entry, does anyone know of a reliable way to place a WordPress tinyMCE
editor on the front-end? I've dug through lots of includes and WordPress
core files, but I can't find a good answer. Has anyone tackled this problem
before?

Thanks a lot for your time,

Kevin

Thanks Rafael,

I've looked at that site before, the biggest problem is that I can't figure
out how to enquque the same styles used on the admin and post pages. I've
tried

do_action("admin_print_styles-post-php");
do_action('admin_print_styles');

but to no avail. I'm thinking that you can't run those from the frontend.
Using the info on that site I was able to get the editor to show up on the
page, but their isn't any css info attached to it. That means that you can't
see most of the buttons and the "Full screen" editor/mode is visible at the
very top-left of the page. Any ideas?

Thanks again for your time,

Kevin

Hi folks,

I'm currently programming a utility for a wordpress blog we're hosting at
work, and now I just wanted to ask, if it's possible to use the export
script from wordpress via command line interface, or is there somehow a
plugin which I could use to export (wordpress content) via command line

Thanks in advance!

Hi Otto

Thanks for this. 

You're absolutely right, I have no idea what I'm doing! I will try to figure out the right way to do this!

get_the_excerpt doesn't take any parameters, it can only be used within the
loop [1].

echo $parent->post_excerpt will return the excerpt of your parent post.

i'm not at my PC at the moment so not sure if that applies the correct
filters or not, so you might need to do:

echo apply_filters( 'the_excerpt', $parent->post_excerpt )

The important thing to keep in mind here is to not get all confused by
the terminology. Just check out the directory, then set up the files
in the right way, and check them in. The whole branch/tag/copy thing
doesn't matter. You can make copies yourself into the right
directories then check them in and that works fine too.

That's what confusing me. 

I remember someone saying I shouldnt do that and that's what threw me. 

So! Without doing anything stupid and after stopping, sitting and thinking here is what I believe I should be doing. Please correct me if I am wrong-

Create a local folder on my Mac and using scplugin checkout my repo to there. 

I am then going to delete everything in the tags folder and the trunk folder. 

Then I will copy my plugin files in to the trunk folder. 

I will make sure my plugin header and readme has a tag of 0.1. 

I will create a folder called 0.1 under tags (in the finder) and copy everything in trunk to that folder. 

I will then commit the whole thing back up. 

Is that right?

Thank you for your help Otto and everyone else. It must be frustrating having someone like me asking questions the answers to which are so straight forward to you. I appreciate your patience! When I have this sorted I will write a blog post about it so hopefully it can help others in my position. 

Thanks

Are you sure? If you copy a tree of files into a new directory (e.g.
tags/1.2) then check that in, you are not going to be creating a tag,
because a) subversion doesn't know anything about tags/1.2 unless you svn
add it. and b) you'll have copied the hidden .svn directories which still
point to the original path.

Well, obviously you'd have to svn add the directory, and the files in
it for that matter. You have to do that to check anything in. As for
the hidden .svn files, it's easy: you don't copy those. You copy the
files, not the directory.

Yes, it's easier to do "svn copy http://whatever/trunk
http://whatever/tags/1.1" and so forth, but that is far more confusing
for somebody just getting the hang of SVN in the first place. Teach
people how to commit files first. Later you show them the advanced
crap.

You can't actually "delete" things. You've already committed them.
Commit means *commit*. In order to delete something, you have to a)
delete it and then b) commit the fact of that deletion.

So don't try to delete everything and start over. Try to *fix* it
instead. Make the files correct and in the correct places. Work with
what you have and correct the mistakes. That will be much simpler to
do.

Ok. That sounds like sound advice. 

In my efforts yesterday I created 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 folders each trying to get it right. Which I obviously failed in. 

So is what I should do update the 0.3 tag folder and the trunk folder to be correct in terms of plugin header and stable tag in readme. Then commit that. Or should I start a new 0.4?

Thanks so much.

OK so what ive done is update the trunk to reflect a new 0.3 version.

I have then copied the trunk files in to the 0.3 tags folder.

I then commit.

However subfolders within the 0.3 tags folder arent committing... any ideas
why?

thank you

Use svn status (http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re26.html) to find out if
you actually added them.  You most likely need to svn add them.

If you copied the folders over wholesale from trunk, they probably have
hidden .svn directories in there. Make your folders anew and copy just the
files you need over.

Actually, I've got just the thing!

http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pods/trunk/ui/wp-editor

Andrew Ozz developed this as the new API for TinyMCE which allows for
front / back end forms and much more functionality beyond the current
mess (you already know what I'm talking about). Goodbye the_editor,
hello wp_editor!

We modified the CSS location in the script, so you'll want to pop it
out and update the location to wherever you end up putting it.

To use use the editor, you can do this:

<textarea name="whatever" id="whatever" class="whatever"><?php echo
esc_html($content); ?></textarea>
<?php
global $wp_editor;
$media_bar = false; // set to true to show the media bar
echo $wp_editor->editor($content, 'whatever', $media_bar);
?>

Oops! Actually I meant to include one more variable before $media_bar
in the function usage. My line above was wrong, see below for the real
code:

<textarea name="whatever" id="whatever" class="whatever"><?php echo
esc_html($content); ?></textarea>
<?php
global $wp_editor;
$media_bar = false; // set to true to show the media bar
$settings = array(); // additional settings, these also pass onto
TinyMCE options, but there are some settings you can tweak
// wpautop: to enable wpautop (default is true)
// wp_buttons_css: location of css;
// editor_class: additional classes to set (default is wp-editor-area)
// upload_link_title: The title of the <a> for the media button(s)
// media_buttons_context: The text to show before the media button(s)
// textarea_rows: how many rows to have on the editor (default is 10)
echo $wp_editor->editor($content, 'whatever', $settings, $media_bar);
?>

Hi all,
current it is possible to include the editor via the_editor()
function, also an different scripts and works. But it is not possible
to add this function clear to meta boxes for posts or other
post_types, if has an editor. The problem is the javascript; the
editor buttons of the editor for switch html/visual has fixed IDs and
the script use this, thats is a great problem and if you switch on a
editor, also the other editor switch and the active button is not
correct.
you see this in editor.dev.js
var ed, qt = this.I('quicktags'), H = this.I('edButtonHTML'), P =
this.I('edButtonPreview'), ta = this.I(id);

if you will include the editor on a othe rpage, include css and
javascript (fast code on mail !!):
add_filter( 'admin_head', 'example_tmce' );
function example_tmce() {
	wp_enqueue_script( 'common' );
	wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery-color' );
	wp_print_scripts('editor');
	if (function_exists('add_thickbox')) add_thickbox();
	wp_print_scripts('media-upload');
	if (function_exists('wp_tiny_mce')) wp_tiny_mce();
	wp_admin_css();
	wp_enqueue_script('utils');
	do_action("admin_print_styles-post-php");
	do_action('admin_print_styles');
}
$value = $this -> load_post_meta( $data->ID );
$id = 'fb_example_tmce';
the_editor($value['example_content'], $id, $prev_id = 'title',
$media_buttons = true, $tab_index = 4, $extended = true);

Best regards

Wow Scott,

I haven't tried the solution yet, but that looks amazing and exactly what
I've needed! I've gotten a hacked together version of the_editor() working
on the backend, and almost on the frontend, but it's really a pain in the
butt to do it that way. I'll try it out soon and let you know what I come up
with.

Thank you very much for responding.

Kevin

This is very cool, and probably something I can use for a plugin that we'll be releasing that I am working on right now!

A couple comments and questions. 

1.) I think your example code is wrong, here's the calling signature from the code from from the link you shared:

function editor( $content, $editor_id, $settings = array(), $media_buttons = true ) 

2.) Any reason the $media_buttons is a forth parameter and not just something to pass in via the 3rd $settings parameter?

3.) Why name it wp_editor? Isn't it best practice to let WordPress itself reserve names prefixed with 'wp_'? I see that it was written for WP3.3 (or a future version); is it actually going into WP3.3 as is, or wouldn't it be better to call it pods_editor?

4.) I notice on line 26 the PODS_URL constant is hard-coded. Since it's named wp_editor that seems like it's intended to be a (semi-)defacto standard extension?  Wouldn't it be better to have that default to (something like) dirname(__FILE__) and/or get_option('wp_editor_path')?

5.) Clearly it is GPL licensed, right?  If I wanted to take it, make these mods and then include in my own plugin what would I need to do be follow the GPL license? (Sorry, if this last question is a bit off topic.)

Once again, it's a really nice extension and thanks for sharing.

I've definitely run into that problem. Would it make any sense/gain any traction to propose making a change to WordPress core to enable the use of TinyMCE on pages that also support the content editor?  To make it work as-is definitely requires some ugly hacking by a knowledgable developer and it would be nice to empower others to do this more easily.

That's right, I posted a correction via reply, not sure if it arrived.
Will correct again, but that's right I was missing the $settings var
before the $media_bar var I was using.

Andrew Ozz put this together, you'd better ask him.

Andrew Ozz put this together, you'd better ask him. The plan is to get
this into WP core for 3.3 or 3.4.

GPL yep

Andrew Ozz is the lead dev for TinyMCE stuff on WP core, so he's THE
man and has done an awesome job with this work.

Hey Scott,

In the CSS code, a menu.png is referenced as a background. What would that
be? I've looked through the core and all I can find is the
wp-admin/images/menu.png. That contains the side-bar images, and I can't
imagine that it is the right one, though I'm willing to be wrong. Thanks
again,

Kevin

No clue, we just implemented Andrew Ozz's work with some minor
modifications (like CSS location).

Now that 3.2 is out, could someone please take a look at Ticket #14397 again
to see if it is something that could be fixed in the next release?
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14397

It's one of the places where I always need to manually patch the core code
before I can roll it out to production.

Thanks!

Scott,

I got the code inserted into a page template (just trying to get it to work)
and I don't see any Visual Editor buttons. I can click on HTML and it
switches so that I see those buttons, but I don't have any Visual buttons at
all. I've changed the CSS location and can view-source and verify that it's
being linked in correctly. Any ideas?

Thanks again,

Kevin

It should also be noted that I'm using this on the Front-end of a website,
not the admin side.

Hmmm, I definitely have a second TinyMCE editor in one of my custom posts
types working fine (though I didn't need nor try to use the image uploader).
No hacking required. It even has visual/html toggle.

I'm heading out now for the rest of the day, but will try to post some code
late tomorrow (I'm on-site with a client all day) or Saturday.

Really?  The default code target a specific element ID and is not designed to be usable so I'm not sure how you'd get that working.  I've got it working, but it took writing a different set of code to do it.

Looking forward to it.  Thanks.

Hey Mike,

Thanks for your help, but my current need is to place the tinyMCE editor on
the front-end of my client's site. They need to be able to use it from the
front-end. I've tried Scott's code, but I'm just not getting it to work
properly. I have a few examples of using the_editor() in multiple places on
the backend, however, I just can't seem to get it to function correctly on
the front-end. Anyone who has been able to do this successfully, please let
me know. I'd really like to have this job done. ;)

Thanks to all who've replied,

Kevin

Have you guys checked out this Front-end Editor plugin? http://scribu.net/wordpress/front-end-editor

I've been using it for front end editing. The version (2.0.1) I'm using uses CLEditor (which is a jQuery extension/plugin) as its editor. The latest version (2.1) has started using an editor called Aloha that I'm not too fond of myself.

I found this plugin before I knew about the wp_editor. Is it easy to add wp_editors to multiple textareas on the same page? Sometimes that can be tricky with tinyMCE.

Here's the actual code we're using in the TinyMCE for Pods package,
I'm sure you can make use of it in some way. After looking, you don't
need to put a textarea in there before it - my bad!

<?php
// New TinyMCE API by azaozz
require_once(PODS_DIR . '/ui/wp-editor/wp-editor.php');
require_once(ABSPATH . '/wp-admin/includes/template.php');

global $wp_editor;
echo $wp_editor->editor($value, $css_id, array(), false);

Hey Dan,

I've only tried wp_editor on the front-end, so I'm not sure how well it
would work on the admin-side. I've toyed around with the idea of using
CLEditor or something similar, but I'd really like to use the built in
tinyMCE if possible. This would keep me from having to include RTE files in
my plugin.

That's what this new code does, multiple instances either on front or
backend of site.

@Kevin - Works for me on front and backend. If you have an issue,
check your browser's console for errors and see if it's an issue with
the editor code or something interfering.

@Scott - Thanks for your help. What version of WP are you using this with?
Is it compatible with 3.2? I've found that I have to enqueue the css file
manually for it to actually affect the editor. Simply changing it in the
wp-editor.php code doesn't do anything for me. Strangely, I can click on the
code in the view-source, and I know that it's linked in correctly. Any
chance that I could see your working front-end version so that I could see
where my problem might be?

Thanks,

Kevin

What format are you looking to export too? Is this being imported to another site?

You could always use commandline mysql and some shell scripting.

Not sure what you are after, more information is needed ;)

Hi folks,

I'm currently programming a utility for a wordpress blog we're hosting at work, and now I just wanted to ask, if it's possible to use the export script from wordpress via command line interface, or is there somehow a plugin which I could use to export (wordpress content) via command line

Thanks in advance!

I'll see if I can set an example page up for you somewhere. Will get

@Scott - Thank you soooo much. I think it is, but I will make sure. I've
check my console, and I don't have any warnings or errors about the editor
on that page. I appreciate all your help, and I look forward to seeing your
example.

Thanks again,

@Scott,

I can report that it does, in fact, work perfectly well. I had some plugins
activated that broke it. I'm looking through them now, activating one by
one, so that I can get a list of the culprits. I'll post those here when I
get it completed. Thanks so much for your help, you have saved me a ton of
time and extra work. :)

It looks like it's just C-Forms II that was causing the problem. Thanks
again for all your help.

Yes, planning to propose this as one of the improvements in core for 
3.3. Relevant tickets on trac so far:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17144
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16695

If all goes according to plan, the class in core will be named WP_Editor 
too and will work pretty similarly to this code so this can be used for 
older versions of WP and 3.3 will have it built-in.

@Scott - Yeah, I've had lots of problems with C-Forms in the past. I'm
actually working on an update to a newly released premium forms plugin, so I
have all kinds of other form plugins installed on my server. Thanks again
for all your help.

Message-ID: <CANqqJr5Hqbne-F4Pw8zNk9GL03yzxnY9RNtJRi8QBiqzv8zpUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I'm trying to figure
out why one of my listings in the WordPress plugin directory is not
updating:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/http-authentication/

As is normal when I release a plugin, I updated the plugin yesterday
with a new version number and updated the readme file with that
version number as the stable tag.

http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/http-authentication/tags/4.1

Other plugins are showing as "recently updated" in the directory. I've
verified my readme file, made sure that the version numbers match,
etc.

Did I forget something? Should I just bump the version number and retag?

I manually forced it.

Next time it misses one, just make a simple edit, like adding a space
to the readme.txt or something, then commit that change. Every commit
should force an update bump.

@Scott - So, I've got it working well on both the front and backends, but I
have a question. If you have more than one per page, how do you keep
media-insertions from always targeting the last tinyMCE? I'm trying some
focus() stuff now, but it's not working out very well for me. Any ideas?

Thanks again,

Kevin

@Scott - Disregard my last email. Sorry to be such a pest, but I think I got
it all working. I'm basically using the tinyMCE command to change focus when
the user clicks on the "add media button". Seems to work nicely. Thanks
again for all of your help.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Accessing wp classes/functions from command line for
	upgrades
Message-ID: <CAAV3MXTpFeASDYn9Cza4swcnN8hReQhcsdccXYK_ZdFRAEUcpQ@mail.gmail.com>

My host has file permission limitations that make plugin
installs/upgrades and core upgrades very difficult. I have to do it
all from ssh. I upgrade core using SVN, which works great for me, but
since I maintain 6-7 sites at this same host, plugin upgrades become
quite time-consuming. I end up having to do this:

cd /home/public/blog/wp-content/plugins
wget http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/google-analytics-for-wordpress.4.0.13.zip
rm -rf google-analytics-for-wordpress
unzip google-analytics-for-wordpress.4.0.13.zip

For each plugin I have installed, and then repeat 6-7 times for each
site. I planned to write a bash script to accomplish this via ssh, or
a php script to run from the command line, but before I went through
the effort, I briefly browsed through core to see if I could re-use
any of the upgrade components  (e.g. WP_Upgrader class).

As a quick test, I dropped the following script into my blog root, and
ran it from ssh using 'php script.php'

define('WP_USE_THEMES', false);
require('./wp-blog-header.php');

include ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/class-wp-upgrader.php';
$upgrader = new Plugin_Upgrader();
$upgrader->upgrade('core-control');

I get the following error: "Fatal error: Call to undefined function
screen_icon() in
/home/public/blog/wp-admin/includes/class-wp-upgrader.php on line
960". I am assuming that since I'm not using themes from the command
line, that all of the UI code in this class may not work correctly.

So my questions:

1. Is there an easy way for me to call this class or other core code
to accomplish this? (maybe subclass the Plugin_Upgrader class and
remove the UI code?)
2. Am I setting up the script correctly to run from the command line?
3. Is this a stupid idea, and I should just write my own php/ssh
script to handle it?

Thanks!

Josh Eaton

You probably can get the actual editor id from the button id (it's a 
substring) and make sure that instance is active. Was thinking to add 
that as default.

Hey Ozz,

That's what I did.Basically the JS grabs the id of the editor then makes it
the focus, so that the images go into that editor. Not a problem obviously
if someone already has their cursor in there. I am having a problem,
however, in getting the wp_editor to work on the admin-side. It's in a
plugin page and the Visual/HTML switch buttons don't work. Moreover, I can't
get more than one to work on the page at once. When I place multiples, I get
the first one fine (minus the not being able to switch from Visual/HTML),
but the second doesn't even have any buttons. When I look at a console, I
get the error that wpEditor is not defined. But when I view-source, I can
see the wpEditor object in the Javascript on that page. I've spent a few
hours going through the code, making sure there isn't something missing from
the admin, I even tried adding the scripts and styles I've needed to get
the_editor to work in the past. I'm pretty much out of ideas of how to fix
it at this point. The front-end is without either of those problems. It
works perfectly there.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,

Kevin

Used this in a plugin:

$upgrader = new Plugin_Upgrader();
$options = array( 'package' => $url,
		'destination'		=> WP_PLUGIN_DIR .'/' . $folder,
		'clear_destination' => true,
		'clear_working'		=> false,
		'is_multi'			=> false,
		'hook_extra'		=> array()
	);

@$upgrader->run($options);

$url is the url on plugin download page, $folder is the actual plugin
folder name.

You are setting it properly, right?

global $wp_editor;
$wp_editor->editor( 'some content', 'one' );
$wp_editor->editor( 'more content', 'two' );

I found the problem. I was using brackets in my form element name and
unwittingly passing those on to the WP_Editor. I attempted escaping the
bracket characters, but eventually just wrote a quick find and replace so
that it can have a bracketed name but not id. Thank you for a great piece of
code. It will save me a lot of time and heartache!

Thanks for this, it helps to have the correct usage.

I guess I should have been more persistent, because I was able to get
it to work after including a few more files.

define('WP_USE_THEMES', false);
require('./wp-blog-header.php');
include ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/misc.php';
include ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/template.php';
include ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/file.php';
include ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/class-wp-upgrader.php';

$url = 'http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/polldaddy.2.0.4.zip';
$folder = 'polldaddy';

$upgrader = new Plugin_Upgrader();
$options = array( 'package'         => $url,
                'destination'       => WP_PLUGIN_DIR .'/' . $folder,
                'clear_destination' => true,
                'clear_working'     => false,
                'is_multi'          =>  false,
                'hook_extra'         => array()
);

@$upgrader->run($options);


I basically just had to use trial and error until it worked, which
made it feel like I was going about it the wrong way. Am I setting up
the script appropriately to run outside of wordpress?

Subject: [wp-hackers] after 3.2 upgrade cannot set images as featured or
	insert
Message-ID: <CADrkmAwe_fN9Mn7tezvhStZ619tt-bncqxFKFH+173crFFiV6w@mail.gmail.com>

I just upgraded to 3.2. Nothing else has changed.
Now I can upload images fine, but when I try to insert into a post or
"use featured image" it just hangs.
Is anyone else having this problem?
Is a bug report in order?

Response headers http://www.pastie.org/2180743

HAR Export http://www.pastie.org/2180751 (viewable in
http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/)

The 3 POSTS is weird, they all return 200 OK but nothing happens and
after clicking "Use featured image" it shows "Saving..." indefinitely.

All comments/help appreciated,
@msacks

I've searched for an answer and didn't find anything. Not even a premium plugin exists, to my knowledge.

Is there any way to do the following:

Have multiple sections within a single WordPress installation (or domain) that each call up a distinct theme?

For example: Maybe I'd like to use one theme for the opening pages; use a second theme for a dedicated e-store; a third theme for a dedicated video store; or another theme for a ticket / help section.

These are just examples.

I know that much can be done with single post templates, but this is not what I'm talking about. I'd really like to be able to use more than one theme on my domain.

(p.s., I know subdomains would be a way, possibly, of doing this. But it seems an awful hassle, to have several installations running, several databases, etc, and I'm sure there would be issues later, not least, perhaps, with SEO).

ANY IDEAS??

thanks,
JB

You might be interested in this SSH Update layer:
http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/wordpress.htm

WordPress has built-in support for the PHP SSH extension, but it requires it
to becompiled manually, that library & plugin will allow it to be done in
pure PHP.
I havn't tested the plugin, and have a few suggestions for the code as it
currently is, but it's a option for you

Multisite install with subdirectories instead of subdomains perhaps?

You can use the body tag's class as a selector in your theme(s). The class
changes depending on where in the blog your are. I've used this technique to
style the links for a single post differently than the rest of my blog. See:

http://blogan.net/blog/2007/10/15/pink-for-liz-colligan/

Obviously, you could use the body class in your CSS selector to make much
more substantial styling changes.

Ah, shoot. Just ignore me. That only allows you to make styling changes, not
theme changes. Back to your original programming... :-(

It's possible to do this by using conditionals in the header.php to serve
different css and JavaScript files to different categories. This only works
if the underlying HTML structure is the same for each of your sections and
you are happy to have each section set up as a category. The only other way
to do this is by using a multisite install and setting each section up as
its own instance within subdomains.

Thanks for that Lynne.

1. What kind of conditionals would I be looking for?
2. General comment thrown into the wilderness: It is obvious that very large organisations have different wings. Wordpress has made great leaps forward lately, in terms of adoption as a full blown CMS. This could be encouraged more if this kind of functionality (the ability to have sections, recalling different themes / aesthetics) were able to be built into a single install.

I'll look into the multisite option.

best,
JB

Using the template system, perhaps in conjunction with custom post types,
will achieve what you're looking to do. *front-page.php* or *home.php*, for
example, will be used on your site's front page. *archive-[custom post
type].php*, *single-[custom post type].php*, etc will be used for a specific
custom post type. *category-[category slug].php* is used for the given
category archive. For more in-depth coverage of this, see
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy.

For greater control, the *template_include* filter, found in
wp-includes/template-loader.php, can be used to override WordPress' selected
template, offering even greater control when paired with conditional tags.

I'll second the multisite with subdirectories suggestion. Since themes for
things like tickets can also have functionality built in and you may be
going with something pre-built, seems like doing all this switching within a
single theme is more trouble than it's worth. Not to mention the weight of
scripts and stylesheets that aren't being used in X section but still being
loaded. My experience with a sprawling multisite subdirectory installation:
it mostly behaves like one site (especially if you use the admin bar to
access tasks - no dashboard switching), visitors are none the wiser, and
search engine results seem unaffected.

Not all that difficult, really.

Let's say each "wing" of an organization's site is a separate Page
hierarchy. You have several options:

1) Create separate custom Page templates for each "wing" (Page hierarchy).
2) Programmatically modify the default Page template content/markup, based
on Page hierarchy (i.e. Parent Page ID), a few different ways:
    1) Hard-code directly in page.php
    2) Call different headers, via get_header( '{page}' ), where {page} is
the "wing"/context/whatever
    3) Call different content, via get_template_part( '{page}' )

The main conditionals you would need are is_page( $page ), and a custom
conditional to determine the top-level parent Page.

Just wondering if the ability to conditionally select child themes
would give you enough of the flexibility you are looking for?

If I had to do this, I would place all of my themes in one basket - inside
the main theme. I would use the base page.php, single.php etc... as an
include engine to identify the context and then include the specified theme
parts. You could get more complex per template such as if(is_page('foo'))
get_theme_template_part(2, 'page', 'front');

Basic file structure of your theme:

   - root - basic WP files only - page.php, single.php etc... I would not
   use any other assets here (css, images, js, etc) - make sure you have all
   the contextual template parts here to fully control the theme (search,
   category, tag, author, etc...)
   - /themes/
      - /theme-1/
      - /theme-2/
      - /theme-3/


Basic functions you would need to build:

   - get_theme_functions($theme_number)
   - get_theme_template_part($theme_number, 'slug', 'name')

I would caution you to make your base theme extremely light. You don't want
to be loading two heavy-weight themes over the top of each other. This is
purely theoretical. I've never tried anything of this nature. Let me know
how it goes.

Cheers!

Are there filter(s) that are far enough up the chain that would allow me to alter every SQL call on both the read and write.

I would like to Find and Replace every query and every write.

Is there somewhere that I can do this with two filters, one for read and one for write.

I do not care about performance, I just want to find and replace all text on both the read and write.

thanks,

How about something like this?

add_filter('query', 'my_query_filter' );

function my_query_filter($query) {
     if ( preg_match( "/^\\s*(insert|delete|update|replace|alter) /i", 
$query ) ) {
         ...
     } else {
         ...
     }
     return($query);
}

And actually, I think that should be "\s" instead of "\\s". Test it out 
to make sure it works for you, as I haven't personally tested it.

Message-ID: <8AD5970A-915E-4464-9D38-8AA4C4E52D30@graymerica.com>

All,

I was wondering if anyone had any sample code or pointer for how to add a custom post type via XML-RPC.

I am trying to create a WP plugin that will let you post a custom post type to central WP site.

It needs to use a API key to authenticate the end user and allow them to post as the user that is associated with the API Key.

I want to be able to add a page to the end user WP dashboard that will let them add a custom post type to the central site.

Any links or tutorials would be great.  If someone has done this before and has code they want to share or sell, I would be interested in this as well.

Thanks,

Andrew

Andrew,

There's a separate mailing list for XML-RPC stuff:
http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-xmlrpc

That said ... you can't *add* a custom post type via XML-RPC.  The custom
post type needs to be defined by a plugin on the site you're posting to,
otherwise it won't stay around after the request is complete.

But if you are writing a plugin to create your own XML-RPC methods (that
sounds like what you're trying to do), here's a tutorial that would be a
good starting place:

I did my GSoC project on this.
The plugin code is here. Still i didnt upload it to the plugin repo.
http://gsoc.svn.wordpress.org/2011/nprasath002/
It works as far as I,m tested.

To use multiple header.php files where you have created template pages for
your sections, see this:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_header

If your sections are set up as categories you can change the appearance &
layout with CSS (and, optionally, JavaScript). To ensure that only the
CSS/js you need for those sections is loaded use the following:

<?php if (is_category(category-1-ID)) { ?>
header.php content
<?php } elseif (is_category(category-2-ID)) { ?>
header.php content for category 2
<?php } else { ?>
Default header.php content for everything else
<?php } ?>

Also see http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags#A_Category_Page

You can use the same conditionals within templates to alter the output or by
calling different templates when certain pages or categories are called.

There are several different ways to achieve what you want within one single
WP site but if you intend to make a lot of conditional calls, for example to
load different templates within your sections, WordPress will perform better
if you take the multisite subdirectory install route. Swapping out the CSS &
scripts etc in the header by using conditionals doesn't have any noticeable
impact on performance. However, if you use this PLUS loads of custom
templates it can make a noticeable difference.

Hi all,
Probably an easy question but still I need to know if there actually is a
safe way of doing this:

Say a plugin creates a custom taxonomy and attaches it to some custom post
type. Is there a safe way to attach that same taxonomy to Posts without
messing with the plugin code?

Thanks in advance!

You can include this in a plugin on a hook that runs later than
whatever the taxonomy is registered at (or at a "higher" priority):
register_taxonomy_for_object_type( $taxonomy, $object_type )

Note however, that this doesn't mean that it'll work with all plugins
which are hard coded to a single post type.

So there really is no way of doing that in the functions.php with just one
line eh? Darn

When i say a plugin, I mean a plugin or a themes functions.php.

Usually this would do it:

add_action('init', 'some_function', 100);
function some_function() {
register_taxonomy_for_object_type( $taxonomy, $object_type );
}

but that's no guarantee.. it'll depend on the plugin.

Works perfectly in my case mate and it's much more elegant than the code
I've written, thanks a lot!

Hi folks -

I  can't figure out how to populate the fields on the image meta box. I see that the title, and description are populated from the image's EXIF fields, but they are not stored in the attachment meta so there for i can't use wp_generate_attachment_meta filter to populate/change them.

Where are they stored?

I'd like to filter the values before they are populated in the image meta box upon new image upload.

Thanks,

They are the title and the_content of the attachment:image post-type.

[Not sure about the appropriate place to pitch this, so here goes nothing.]

Currently, all the mobile apps <http://wordpress.org/extend/mobile/> for
WordPress are 100% native.

Aside from the phone camera, there isn't any native functionality that's
being leveraged.

Therefore, I think it would be a good idea to start thinking about moving at
least part of the code to HTML5, as this article suggests:

+1000000 from a mostly-observer, if that helps :)

Just some very humble thoughts/silly questions:

- This should open mobile development up to a lot more people (yay!)
- Extensible screens for mobile sound awesome, but a little scary (bad code
will always be bad code)
- Curious as to how multiple sites/domains would be managed centrally, from
.com to hosted installs - log in for your bookmarks/added sites? Everyone
makes a .com or .org account?
- Would these mobile versions live in .org somewhere (probably not
extensible then) or core? Maybe a plugin?
- If changes to mobile admin are made in core or even a plugin, maybe this
is a feature that helps parallel and highlight the movement toward
background/silent incremental updates

By extensible you mean via plugins?

The way I see it, a hybrid app would still live entirely on your phone, so
nothing changes in this regard. (Eventually, we could have some code in WP
Core that would be leveraged by the native part of the hybrid app.)

The code and development for the current apps (as well for hybrid apps) live
on .org. For example, see http://android.wordpress.org/ So, again, nothing
changes in this regard.

The goal is to have at least some common code between the apps and
eventually to have some common code with WP Core.

At first, the update schedule will also remain unchanged, i.e. each app has
it's own.

Yes - like I said, it sounds like territory that could be dangerous, but I
could see how the occasional mucking with a screen could work well for,
let's say, a CMS-oriented installation (e.g. a custom post type or similar)

I think I get your idea now - I was thinking more along the example of Bank
of America, where it loads pages remotely, rather than building the
interface using HTML/CSS/JS. The advantage of loading remote pages is that
it wouldn't require the users updating their specific applications to get
updates, but it does also eat up more data, I suppose.

ok, getting a little closer. I'm now using the attachment_fields_to_edit hook to populate the empty form fields on the attachment meta screen but i can't populate the "Alternate text" field. 

I see it in the $form_fields array that is passed into the hook but any label or value I set on it does not show up on the form.

any ideas?

-P-

Is this any help? It's some code I found somewhere and adapted to put the EXIF title in all three text boxes on the image upload page:

add_filter('attachment_fields_to_edit', 'image_caption_to_title', 11, 2 );

function image_caption_to_title( $form_fields, $post ) {
	if ( substr( $post->post_mime_type, 0, 5 ) == 'image' ) {
		$form_fields['post_excerpt']['value'] = $post->post_title;
		$form_fields['image_alt']['value'] = $post->post_title;
	}
	return $form_fields;
	}

Works for me, anyway

Thanks for this.

When it comes down to it, I really need to activate the entire theme, with the functionality it has. So it's more than appearances. This is the difficulty.

Having looked into this more, and having tried a multisite installation (and then having experienced the difficulty of cloning a multisite install, and even backing one up), I'm heading in a direction few would agree with: discreet installs in subdirectories.

Consequently, I have a new question: 

I now have four installs working together to constitute a site: 1) http://mydomain.com (an opening theme); 2) http://mydomain.com/main (the main site, based on a separate theme and a separate install); 3) http://mydomain.com/store (based on the same theme as /main but with a custom skin); and 4) http://mydomain.com/ads (based on the same theme as /main but with a custom skin).

I want to keep the last two installs (#3 and #4) because I want to keep the URLs tight (i.e., http://mydomain.com/store and not http://mydomain.com/main/store).

My question is: How can I integrate http://mydomain.com/main and http://mydomain.com/store so customers joining and logging in to /main are automatically linked to (and logged in to) /store and /ads?

All sites are run within one database, with different wp_ prefixes. I tried adding the following to the bottom of the wp-config.php file of the installs I want to link:

/** Unify Logins. */
define(CUSTOM_USER_TABLE,'wp5_users');
define(CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE,'wp5_usermeta');

wp5_ prefix is the prefix of the install I want to take precedence.

(I picked up this tip here, by the way).

But when I log into wp5_ (install #2) and go to the admin of wp6_ (install #3) it asks me to login again. 

So: a) customers of wp5_ (install #2 or /main) would have to have a separate account on wp6_ (install #3 or /store) and wp7_ (install #4 or /ads). People would be logging in twice or more. I want to unify these.

Can I somehow bridge these installs?

An added complexity is that I want to use s2Member or something similar to manage membership of my site as a whole.

I also wanted users to be able to use their login details to access the site's forum (which so far is based on phpBB3; this plugin allows you to bridge Wordpress and phpBB3, but only by making all access to Wordpress be handled by phpBB3).

If anyone can help me navigate through this maze I would be eternally grateful!!

best,
JB

Make sure all the installs share the same salts/keys as well

You'll then need to make the cookie apply to / rather than /install/
You can do this by defining the extra constants.
see the *COOKIEPATH constants here:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/default-constants.php#L198

The capabilities for each user are stored in the usermeta, while you
can define a custom user table, the capabilities are stored as
per-site, meaning, the usermeta row has the database prefix prefixed.

You're probably also not going to be able to use most plugins such as
s2Member without heavy modification or syncing of the options to all
the sites in your "network"..

Long story short? You're going to have some headaches tieing 5
different installs together, and then getting plugins working nicely
on it too, there is a reason MultiSite installs were invented.

Thanks Dion,

You're probably right about multisite. I have two problems with it, however: 1) I really wish BackupBuddy played well with it. I can make an individual backup within multisite, but I can't see how to import a site using it. The tutorials I have read on importing an existing site into multisite are either confusing to me, or, if I follow them, don't work. I don't end up with the site I have externally, but rather end up facing starting from scratch; 2) I'm worried about incompatible plugins.

If could solve problem #1 it would be an advance.

I guess a third problem is how (given that I'm working localhost) I get my multisite online eventually.

It's just scary.

There really needs to be a cloning plugin for multisite!

best,
JB

Access to the camera is a pretty big deal, mostly the reason that the current native apps exist right now.  If you can't upload an image from your device that would be a huge loss to the user.  I have seen support for accessing files from the mobile browser in Android, so hopefully other platforms will support this soon as well.

Maybe we could start developing the HTML5 version as development continues with the native apps, then potentially switch over if the web app becomes more awesome than the native experience?

There's nothing stopping development of a HTML5 web-app as a plugin, which
would effectively give a mobile version of the admin panel - you would just
visit the admin panel via your phones browser. Then, if it becomes good
enough, it could be merged into core.

There certainly are issues surrounding the access to phone hardware via a
web app though, so maybe the hybrid approach of a native app using web-views
within it would work.

This is what Facebook does for its iPhone app - the activity stream is
actually a web-view.

Great to see interest there, I was planning to bring this up on the
3.3 dev meeting.
I think native apps still make sense, not only for access to hardware,
but also to optimize the experience at some points (background
uploading, notifications, offline, performance, ...)
That said I think parts of the apps could use more html5 and we have
plans to at least experiment with that and see how it goes.

What I'd like to see is a wp-admin that works as nicely as possible on
mobile devices. You're probably not going to get a wysiwyg editor or
file upload from the browser, but the rest of the features should be
available.

Once we have that, we can truly focus on simplicity on the mobile apps
and having only the things that make most sense to have in a native
way (e.g.: Quick Photo, QuickPress-like posting, notifications,
comment moderation,...), and then maybe integrate the full dashboard
in a hybrid way (or just send the user to the browser)

Just speaking from my own experience developing and maintaining a high
profile multisite in subfolders installation, which we chose in part for the
same reason you should - single sign on, discreet URLs. You'll still need a
function or plugin to assign a user a role on each network site during/after
sign up, I would guess, but is_user_logged_in() will tell you whether
they're logged into any part of the installation.

1) I've never dealt with a backup plugin, but really, it's not all that
difficult to just export the database/tables with phpMyAdmin yourself. I
personally would rather rely on myself than a plugin, but that's definitely
the type A "if you want something done right, do it yourself" in me. It
seems like BackupBuddy does the entire DB in a multisite instance, rather
than individual sites. With just a few network sites, I'd probably be okay
with restoring the whole thing if something went wrong, but of course I
don't know exactly what you're doing.

2) There are definitely incompatible plugins out there, but there's usually
an alternative that does work.

3) Migrating takes a little work (unserialize, search and replace,
reserialize the DB), but once you get used to it, it's also not particularly
difficult or even necessarily time consuming. It's just about developing a
routine that works for you.

If, by cloning, you mean copy an existing sub site when creating a new sub
site: there are a couple of (commercial) plugins out there that will do
that. Check out wpebooks.com for their replicator plugin. There are others
too. I even wrote a custom one for a client a couple of years ago.


As for developing on localhost, here's how to solve all those related
problems: modify your hosts file to fake your final site. e.g. add
127.0.0.1 myrealdomain.com
to your hosts file. On windows the file is
c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts on mac/linux it's /etc/hosts

That's it! Now all you need to do, when you have finished developing, is
dump the whole database from local and import the whole database to live.
Don't forget to ftp themes, plugins, config files, and content.

As for your original request. You can switch themes based on which part of
the site your are in using something like this proof of concept
http://pastebin.com/SESyAu0S

It's quite crude, but if your site is organised with distinctive urls it may
be enough

 Cheers,

Mike

+100. Anyone willing to work on that would have full support of the

Remember the fact that you cannot comment in a post if it has no prior comments (in fact, you cannot comment at all, just reply to comments). When you have a P2 or a blog with multiple authors you feel somehow limited.

I know that it's not a priority because it's not the general use of the mobile apps. Just something to keep in mind.

Hopefully enough relevant pieces to see what I've done.

As mentioned, it works fine: the content gets passed in the correct form
field.

I didn't need to support media insert here so I don't know what might be
needed to enable that and get it to work, though there seems to have been
some pointers in the rest of this thread.

you can also see on this plugin as example.
but i think, the function the_editor() is very nice for dong, only the
javascript problem from an older mail here is the bug, the script use
a static id for switch html/visual.

Message-ID: <CAH9UVvGqXdysxHqLHtZ8Fuj24F6Ad2dq+ftT55yza5N8tV+xyA@mail.gmail.com>

With WP 3.2 has WordPress maybe a new function for add quicktags to
the editor. But i font an function to set defaults for the
link-button: wplink.js (Line 278
http://wpseek.com/source/wp/latest/nav.html?wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wplink/js/wplink.dev.js.source.html)

    setDefaultValues : function() {
        // Set URL and description to defaults.
        // Leave the new tab setting as-is.
        inputs.url.val('http://');
        inputs.title.val('');

        // Update save prompt.
        inputs.submit.val( wpLinkL10n.save );
    },
How it is possible to set the values for a custom values? Thanks for
an answer from javascript-experts.

Thanks and best regards

I'd be interested in helping with this, too.

I believe that media queries are considered a safe bet for mobile
devices, certainly recent generation ones. Modern mobile devices have,
in the main, extremely good support for the emerging HTML, CSS and
JavaScript standards.

I agree, and actually I was thinking that TwentyTwelve should include 
this technique to show how it can be leveraged to serve content to 
mobile devices.

Subject: [wp-hackers] options capabilities bug?
Message-ID: <CAGEuVU1xvyMC1wTBTuQ6wVCG37T0+xcTpLx1+iCwWDqoE+4rqA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using Justin Tadlock's excellent Members plugin to create a "Super
Editor" role. Basically to allow some client editors to change
settings on the site, but to keep them from updating, installing
plugins, etc.

So, besides the usual Editor capabilities, I've assigned them the
manage_options one.

They can see the Settings menus, but when they submit one, they get
the "You do not have permission" notice.

I've tracked this down to this in my custom theme code:

add_action( 'admin_menu', 'slt_all_settings_link' );
function slt_all_settings_link() {
	add_options_page( __('All Settings'), __('All Settings'),
'update_core', 'options.php' );
}

I want this "all settings page" output just for admins, so I use the
update_core capability. However, setting it this way causes the above
issue with users who have been granted the manage_options capability,
but who don't have the capability set for the options.php page. If I
change the above capability to manage_options, the other screens work
too.

Is this a bug? Or is it just something unavoidable in the way the
internal options handling works?

I'm setting the above page to be visible with manage_options for now,
it's no biggie - just thought I report this in case there's other
ramifications.

cheers,

Steve

This is a known issue, with a workaround added to 3.2. (You can see the
workaround in action in Twenty Eleven.)

Copying straight out of my own
code<https://github.com/chipbennett/oenology/blob/d586858687a4b00885a88c0b7084dd87153b1c4e/functions/options.php>(so
I don't have to rewrite the explanation):

/**
 * Filter Capability for Theme Settings Page
 *
 * This filter implements a WordPress 3.2 fix for
 * a minor bug, in which add_theme_page() is passed
 * the "edit_theme_options" capability, but the
 * settings page form is passed through options.php,
 * which expects the "manage_options" capability.
 *
 * The "edit_theme_options" capability is part of the
 * EDITOR user role, while "manage_options" is only
 * available to the ADMINISTRATOR role. So, users in
 * the EDITOR user role can access the Theme settings
 * page, but are unable actually to update/save the
 * Theme settings.
 *
 * The function is hooked into a hook, introduced in
 * WordPress 3.2: "option_page_capability_{option_page}",
 * where {option_page} is the name of the options page,
 * as defined in the fourth argument of the call to
 * add_theme_page()
 *
 * The function returns a string consisting of the
 * appropriate capability for saving Theme settings.
 */
*function** oenology_get_settings_page_cap() {*
*	return 'edit_theme_options';*
*}*
*// Hook into option_page_capability_{option_page}*
*add_action**(** 'option_page_capability_oenology-settings',
'oenology_get_settings_page_cap' );*

I added on a bit to what Twenty Eleven does, by passing
oenology_get_settings_page_cap() to add_theme_page(), just to ensure
consistency:

/**
 * Setup the Theme Admin Settings Page
 *
 * Add "Oenology Options" link to the "Appearance" menu
 */
function oenology_add_theme_page() {
	add_theme_page(
		// $page_title
		// Name displayed in HTML title tag
		'Oenology Options',
		// $menu_title
		// Name displayed in the Admin Menu
		'Oenology Options',
*		// $capability*
*		// User capability required to access page*
*		oenology_get_settings_page_cap(), *
		// $menu_slug
		// String to append to URL after "themes.php"
		'oenology-settings',
		// $callback
		// Function to define settings page markup
		'oenology_admin_options_page'
	);


So, easy fix, once you know what's going on.

Hi,

I was wondering if there are already best practices developed for adding
default widgets to sidebars for a custom theme, so that upon
installation those widget will be attached to the sidebars automatically
during activation.

Thanks in advance!

Hi,

As far as I can see there is no roadmap for what will be the focus for
the next version(s) of WordPress? Or am I just overlooking it? I tried
trac, but this just shows the tickets still open for the next version.
What I'm looking for is more of a 'vision' or focus for the next
versions, so I know what I can expect (& tell my clients) and see where
I may be able to help out. Anyone know where I should look?

Thanks,

Hi guys,

I am trying to display a random post on homepage using
 query_posts('orderby=rand')

The problem is I want to display the next and previos post links
alphabetically. That is to say, if I have posts with following titles:

Apple
Ball
Cat
Dog

And if Cat is chosen as random post, the next and previous link should show
Dog and Ball respectively. Any help for achieving this would be highly
appreciated.

I haven't tried it, but from a quick glance at the query code, this might work:

query_posts(array('orderby'=>'rand title'));

There's a single space between rand and title. So you'll get random
posts which should then be ordered by the title.

Ahh, yes. Of course that doesn't work. SQL doesn't work that way.

Well, the only thing I can think of is to sort the $wp_query->posts
manually after getting the random list.

Message-ID: <CAD-Fghzo39Pzs9uqWAWX3Cc0EMNNgfXG8U98+t=dN+2aQHvs7w@mail.gmail.com>

I just put a patch on http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16687
yesterday that should make verbose page rules less painful. However,
testing the patch is tricky, as I lack a site with a lot of pages and
which wants to use the %postname% or %category%/%postname% rule.

If anybody has such a site and knows how to performance test and such,
it would be handy if you could work with this patch* and see how it
improves things. I think there's still room for improvement by
modifying it to not use get_page_by_path and instead to create a new
function which both get_page_by_path and this code would use to check
if a page exists, sort of thing. But to know if it helps, I'd need
before and after type numbers of some sort.

Hi All,


hope you're doing well.. I'm using the latest *bbpress* beta and implemented
custom login/register/forgot pages using the page templates which come with
the theme. my only problem is when there's an error (email exists, empty
password etc.) the form redirects to /wp-login.php , I can't seem to find
the way to override this url and return the user to the page he came from
along with the notices/erros.. any ideas?

Wondering if there's a best-practice way to add styles to the DFW - the
editor styles are golden, but with the background color being different, it
looks a little awkward and I'd like to make it that much more seamless for
users. I'd also like to change the title style while I'm at it. Firebug
inspection tells me it's possible, so if there's a particular way I should
do it, I'd love to know.

If you want just simple style overrides, something like this should do the
trick: https://gist.github.com/1078876

You can also just add the styles directly to your editor-style.css.

It might help that you don't have to fully sort the list.
All that should be required is to traverse the list looking for the
post that is less than the rand post but greater than any other post
which is also less. In addition find any post that is greater than the
rand post but less than all other posts which are greater.

So a single loop through the titles should give you want you need.

Claude

I solved the issue by creating custom_field with 'title' key and just
copying same title. This is because I could use comparison operators on
meta-values in WP_QUERY. My code looked something like this:

In index.php above the loop:
query_posts(array('orderby'=>'rand', 'posts_per_page'=>1));

In functions.php:

function next_prev_links ($title){
wp_reset_query();
$next_query = new WP_Query( array( 'orderby' => 'title', 'order' => 'ASC',
'posts_per_page' => 1, 'meta_key' => 'title', 'meta_value' => $title,
'meta_compare' => '>' ) );
wp_reset_query();
$prev_query = new WP_Query( array( 'orderby' => 'title', 'order' => 'DESC',
'posts_per_page' => 1, 'meta_key' => 'title', 'meta_value' => $title,
'meta_compare' => '<' ) );

/*
echo permalinks here....
*/
}

This gave me objects for the next and previous links and used them for
displaying the links.

Although this uses 3 SQL queries, I thought it was a much cleaner solution
than sorting an array of random posts (which might contain 100s of posts),
then looping through them to find next and previous posts.

Thanks for all the help :)

For everything but TinyMCE you can add styles to the page (the normal 
way). For tmce you can add them to editor-style.css or add another 
stylesheet with the filter 'mce_css'.

Note that in 3.2 the editor body in the tmce iframe gets class 
"wp-editor" for the normal one and "wp-fullscreen-editor" for DFW so you 
can target them easily.

If you want to modify the background for DFW, take a look at this plugin to

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using WP_CONTENT_DIR
Message-ID: <9DB57A2C210B472391FC32B718662A3C@gmail.com>

Hi all,

For some reason I'm having no luck with the line in my wp-config.php:
define( 'WP_CONTENT_DIR', '/path/to/my/wp-content' );

I've added it with all of the correct parameters and I've already set my wp-config.php to work in the same remote directory. It just doesn't seem to register at all. Nothing coming from my error log either.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

Jack

Not to be rude for asking such a simple question, but it's a common one:

Are you adding the define above (where it should be) or below (where
it won't work)  the "Stop Editing!" & Include wp-settings lines?

(As a side note, you'll probably want to define WP_CONTENT_URL once
you get the directory one working)

Subject: [wp-hackers] 3.3 brainstorm ideas from WordPress DC
Message-ID: <CAGeDw9_DnG3XOML7=gG6=-zj1UsFxQTk1kOBKV72GJQF1nRSTg@mail.gmail.com>

Last Night Matt was in DC and led a brainstorm of ideas for 3.3.  This list
is just a brainstorm of things that people would like to see and it is very
possible some of these would make better plugins then core features.
 Posting it so others can benefit from seeing it.


   1. Media - John P Block


   1. Media library over 20 pieces
   2. Custom taxonomy as a file system?
   3. Media library management (popular) - searching images
   4. Better lay outs (popular)
   5. Single image post, could be easier
   6. Galleries
   7. Drag and drop upload (Drag and Drop Uploader)


   1. Tags on link manager
   2. Social - Super Community ()
   3. When to use Tags and Categories (inline help)
   4. Improved API for screen options
   5. Keyboard shortcuts for absolutely everything
   6. API for trimming Jorbin?s beard
   7. Image suggestions, Zemanta
   8. Easily customizeable for users, design control in next default theme
   9. Certification process for 3rd party themes, kinda already done


   1. Themes should have a requirement for better documentation, user
   documentation


   1. Seperate template themes
   2. Sidebar media widget library, Video Widget (amen!)
   3. Coding standards for themes
   4. Multiple galleries in one post? Galleries like objects
   5. Review old themes, mark unreviewed themes already accepted
   6. Lots of pages and permalinks slows down. See Chris Coyier, CSS-Tricks
   post about this
   7. Plugin quality


   1. Better screen shots
   2. Indication for code review
   3. Number of committers
   4. Active users
   5. Installed vs. Active
   6. Deprecated function search, latest stuff = good
   7. E_Notice requirement, if it?s quiet with WP_Debug on
   8. Plugin version pie chart broken
   9. Image slugs
   10. What plugins have been approved for VIP
   11. Author notes about external calls
   12. Is plugin comment helpful? Like Amazon comments
   13. Alternatives/ suggest / related plugins


   1. Voice and SMS comments/notifications
   2. Social twitter/facebook comments coming back
   3. Integrated message board, aka bbPress
   4. Front end editing, in place
   5. More export options on export, dev exports


   1. XML export widget settings


   1. Native mobile device detection, integrated WP_Touch
   2. Visual editor for text widget/ visual editor api
   3. Mobile editor theme
   4. Asset Manager for distraction free writing
   5. Autosave doesn?t work if you remove title from custom post type
   (localStorage HTML5 goodness)
   6. VIM keybindings in DFW

Pulling the Theme-related brainstorm items up from the list:

   -   Certification process for 3rd party themes, kinda already done
   -   Themes should have a requirement for better documentation, user
   -   documentation
   -   Seperate template themes
   -   Coding standards for themes
   -   Review old themes, mark unreviewed themes already accepted

If I may, could I request that, if anyone has ideas for
standards/best-practices/guidelines/etc. for Themes, that such discussion
include the theme-reviewers email list? The Theme Review team would love to
know what the community is thinking along these lines, and would be the
"front line", so to speak, in implementing standards for repository-hosted
Themes. also, the theme-reviewers mail-list is the most-likely place to find
the largest assembly of Theme developers, who may have input on such ideas.

If not the theme-reviewers mail list, then I would recommend
make.wordpress.org/themes.

And if not there, just let us know where the discussion will take place, so
that we can do our part to ensure that the Theme Review team and the Theme
developer community are as involved as possible.

I would agree, I had just copied the list of ideas.  Thanks for pulling
those out Chip.

It should be green and both of these should be a plugins (and pretty awesome
plugins too)

Also, Russell Heimlich deserves the credit for taking the notes on all of
these.

These items are not 3.3 feature requests, so I wouldn't expect them to 
be decided somewhere other than

make.wordpress.org/themes. That said, I would like to figure out a way to get the theme review team working closer with core team instead of it feeling siloed like it does now. Maybe we could set up an IRC chat to brainstorm ideas?

If we add this one, can we also have an API to clean my house? That would rock.

Subject: [wp-hackers] File management permission/owner best practices
Message-ID: <4E1DC39F.2090309@philipwalton.com>

I'm running WordPress on my own server (Debian 6.0) that I have ssh and 
root access to. My web server runs as www-data. I'd like to set up all 
the files in my WordPress directory to user/group philip/www-data, but 
I'm encountering problems.

According to this site 
<http://www.chrisabernethy.com/why-wordpress-asks-connection-info/>, 
before WordPress download a plugin/theme it "creates a temporary file 
and confirms that the file just created is owned by the same user that 
/owns the script currently being run/". in this case 
|wp-admin/plugin-install.php|. In my case the file it creates is owned 
by www-data, so it fails because |wp-admin/plugin-install.php |is owned 
by philip.

I could do "chown -R www-data:www-data .", but then I run into issues 
when trying to do things like rsync because I connect via ssh as philip. 
I use rsync to upload my own themes and plugins all the time, and it's

What do other people do to overcome this? What are the recommended best

And now, for another question - can I change the width of the
#wp-fullscreen-wrap div? It's a little narrower than it should be (12px to
be exact) and, having just now tried it in Twenty Eleven on another site,
the same thing happens there, down to the pixel. I see that it's an inline
style and I'm guessing it's determined in the JS. Is this something for Trac
instead?

Yes, basically you're looking at this from the wrong perspective.
There's two cases to consider.

One is a dedicated webserver, where there is only one user of the box
and its websites. In this case, you don't really want the webserver to
be the owner of the files, because if there is any sort of hacker who
gains access via the webserver, then he will end up with the
credentials of that server. So if somebody breaches the code, then
they end up being the "www-data" user. If www-data has access, then
now your hacker has the same access. If www-data can rewrite your
files directly, then so can your hacker. So for security reasons, you
*need* to have that FTP data input there.

In the case of a shared server, you have multiple users all sharing
the same webserver. Each user has different credentials. In this case,
a hacker who gained access as www-data would now have access to a much
wider range of accounts and websites. However, in such a scenario,
users are more likely to have more open permissions schemes, such as
777 uploads directories and the like. This makes these users targets
even for the hacker with www-data credentials, giving him backdoor
access into those other sites.

In such a case, many shared servers use a method called "setuid" or
similar. Essentially, this is a modified way to run PHP such that,
when the webserver process calls the PHP executable, a script or other
code changes the user id of the running process to be the same as the
owner of the PHP script. So instead of PHP running as "www-data", it
runs my files as "otto". This has two effects: a) anybody hacking into
my website gets my credentials, but that protects other users of the
machine (since I won't have access outside my directories) and it
eliminates the need for sites to run with open permissions schemes
like 777 and such and b) if the process creates a file, it creates it
with my user id, thus allowing the direct upgrade method to work and
eliminating my need to input FTP credentials.

The bottom line is that you shouldn't be changing file ownership in
order to use the direct upgrade method at all. That will always lead
to poorer security. If you're on a testing machine or just totally
unconcerned about security issues, you can pre-define the FTP
credentials by using defines in your wp-config.php file. Use FTP_HOST,
FTP_USER, and FTP_PASS. If you are using ftp over ssh, you can also
define FTP_SSH, FTP_PUBKEY and FTP_PRIKEY as needed. For ftp over ssl,
define FTP_SSL. You can find all these in wp-admin/includes/file.php.

1) how do I fix this

2) is this bad for SEO?

The site feed is working fine but the errors are occurring like so...

URL/category/title/feed

What am I doing wrong?

If your on debian, its pretty easy to switch to suPHP which will use
your username/group
Its not as fast as mod_php, or alternatively there is mpm_itk in
debian, which has the speed and the shared memory of mod_php and still
uses usernames.
I used to use it before switching to gentoo.

Thanks Otto, that's very helpful. I'll look into the setuid process as 
it sounds exactly like what I'm wanting to do.

Message-ID: <16183231.1708.1310580268933.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@yqdy19>

I built a Theme Settings page via the Settings API and managed to add the 
"screen_layout" tab (right next to the "help" tab in the upper right corner) 
and customize its content. After inspecting global $current_user, I found 
that $current_user saves stuff like $current_user->screen_layout_{$screen} 
for posts, pages and custom post/content types, but nothing for custom 
Settings pages. I inspected core, but couldn't get around what is 
responsible for saving the screen_layout. Any help would be highly 
appreciated. Thanks! K.

Hi Aaron,

Thanks, so this means there is not a more long-term vision document
somewhere? Sometimes (more corporate) clients would like to see a more
'visionary' document for the near future if you catch my drift. Would be
great if something like this would become part of the WordPress
Foundation's actions. I will keep an eye on wpdevel.

Interesting list. I definitely could agree with some of the items to
become part of WordPress Core. What is the procedure to get a vote on
what gets into WordPress core (and when) and what not?

Message-ID: <CAL7NTe92Dzhekj67qbFN81YEdX6Dy42_ha=yhOBCRrsXuB6iPA@mail.gmail.com>

Maybe this is something within 3.1/2 already and I'm missing it, I can't
find the trac ticket if one exists either.

I've been using something very similar to this for quite some time and I'm
wondering why we don't have _termmeta built in,
http://shibashake.com/wordpress-theme/add-term-or-taxonomy-meta-data

I'm not looking to extend any UI; just add a new table and allow us devs to
continue to build cool stuff.

I'd be happy to create a trac ticket if one already doesn't exist
(I haven't already because I find it hard to believe) and also write my
first patch.

Thanks everyone.

What's your use case?

Terms are labels which are attached to a taxonomy. A taxonomy is a
system for grouping objects in some way. Meta information is attached
to objects describing those objects. So, basically, because terms
aren't objects, they therefore don't need meta information. They kind
of *are* meta information, in that they label the groups of other
objects.

Generally, when people have talked about this with me, I've found that
there is usually a better way to solve their problem.

I'm not saying that there isn't a use case, I just don't know of one
off the top of my head, and would be interested in finding a good one.

I understand the desire for such a document. However, I think it would be
dangerous. It would be encouraging expectations that very well might not
ever be met.

I think this is a rather short-sighted viewpoint of the purpose of a roadmap
for a project of the size and maturity of WordPress.

Dates and goals can, will, and do change; but it helps *everyone* to have
some long-term vision laid out for the project - especially for a project
that depends on contributions from a diverse community. Having expectations
that change based on changing circumstances is far superior to having no
expectations at all.

I'm sure, somewhere, internally to the core devs, some sort of long-term
roadmap exists. Personally, I'm fine with that group maintaining that
roadmap (no need for bikesheds), but I think it would only benefit the
contributor community (and, for that matter, parts of the potential user
community) if more of the roadmap were made public.

Fair point. I probably locked in to the desire to have a plan for upcoming
versions to show to clients, which made me assume the desire was for
something fairly specific, rather than an overall vision. Mea culpa.

That's pretty much the reason we don't have one. The annual core team 
meetup generally maps out the vision for the coming year, and takes 
input from the dev channel, forums, contributor working groups, etc into 
account. When we met this year in January, it was a decision to try and 
give releases more focus instead of a hodgepodge of random new features 
(i.e., focus on performance, update experience, media, whatever). Since 
development is largely driven by the people who write the code, and 
because the web application landscape changes so quickly, by the end of 
the year we usually find ourselves shifting the plan to stay ahead of 
(or at least current with) the curve. Doing a multi-year plan would not 
work well in this environment. Overall, the mission is to democratize 
publishing, so the vision as we move forward will continue to evolve as 
influencing factors (user requests, competitive landscape, technical 
limitations, contributor interests) change.

Hi Travis,

Yes, or it could inspire us all and make sure we will deliver. I guess
it depends on how to manage expectations :)

Well, that's pretty easy for you or me to say. We're not the ones doing the
delivering, though.

This decision is made by the core team leads and permanent commit-level 
contributors (taking user and developer feedback into consideration). 
Being a contributing developer who submits good patches, takes feedback 
well/is willing to collaborate, doesn't appear to have an agenda at odds 
with the core leadership, and sticks around will carry the most weight. 
To this end, being helpful on Trac, constructive during the weekly core 
dev chats in IRC, and leaving useful comments on wpdevel are ways to 
earn a good reputation.

Scope is determined via two IRC meetings each cyle with a wpdevel post 
in between. Watch wpdevel this week for the post, and the scope 
decisions will be made next Wednesday for 3.3.

I'm more than willing to help out with the delivering, as long as I know
what it is what we need to deliver :)

Joking aside, in the past I have participated with some tickets but I
lost interest in doing so as it was not (and still isn't very) clear to
me how to make sure my contributions were seen and eventually put to
good use. It felt to me to much of a gamble if my time investment would
be in vain or not. So instead I focus on developing plugins and helping
out other people.

I'm still very much willing to invest time in working on WordPress Core,
but I still have the feeling that WordPress misses clear and transparent
guidelines on contributions, especially when working on bigger issues.
Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from how other open source projects
deal with this? Btw this is also one of the things I have suggested on
the survey Matt is conducting.

We built a theme that styles the site differently based on where you're at
on a site. Think of a travel site: where San Francisco has the bay bridge as
the background for the term archive and the individual pages, then New York
has the park.

I couldn't think of any other way to do this since we want to use term's (
location taxonomy ) instead of building something that essentially recreates
the taxonomy functionality with term meta.


Thanks for the time!

What's the definition of an "object" in WordPress such that some things apply and others do not?

-Mike
P.S. Also, are you making a distinction between "Term" not being an object yet "Term Taxonomy" is an object?  Or not?

Just out of curiosity, what are you wanting to do, that you can't do with
some combination of:

1) category-{slug}.php/tag-{slug}.php, with is_category()/in_category(),
is_tag()/has_tag()
2) taxonomy-{taxonomy}-{term}.php, with is_tax()
3) , the CSS classes output by body_class()

Given your example use case, I think it can be accomplished easily using
nothing but the above-available tools.

Taxonomies exist in the template hierarchy. That would work for your
taxonomy archive cases:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Custom_Taxonomies_display

Example:
taxonomy-location-new-york.php
taxonomy-location-san-francisco.php

Although for background images, your case might be simplified by just
using the appropriate body_class() styles. body_class() generates
tax-taxonomy and term-slug on taxonomy archive pages.

Example:
body.tax-location.term-new-york {
 background-image:...
}

body.tax-location.term-san-francisco {
 background-image:...
}


Doing this on individual post pages are harder, since posts can be in
more than one group in a taxonomy (like cats and tags can). For
something like that, you're going to always need some kind of custom
code to determine which term to use to decide what to do.

Message-ID: <CAKh11B6iJF7vNzomtbzVaBNuyzLj_L_zqXp-D7mg37pD-OLtoA@mail.gmail.com>

In a recent wordpress-dev chat I requested that the three line patch in
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15600#comment:16
be merged.  This patch checks for a null return result and avoids emptying
out the post contents if there was a regex error (the common one being too
much regex backtracing).  This is to avoid post bodies becoming the empty
string randomly when somebody has multiple shortcodes in use.

I was told that only critical patches or regressions would be accepted for
3.2 or 3.2.x.  Today 3.2.1 came out with bugs addressed like
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18046 to add some padding to the admin
interface.

Is there some sensible explanation why fixing padding in the admin interface
is important enough to do on the release branch, but adding a null return
result check which prevents erasure of the post content in reasonable
real-life circumstances is not?  If this is an oversight, could the null
return result patch please be applied for 3.2.2?

Thank you,
Bill

PS.  There is also a more comprehensive fix in that bug which is hopefully
scheduled for 3.3.  I am only talking about the patch in comment 16 for
3.2.x.

I think term meta is one of the key features missing from WordPress.

I've run into various situations, a number of which are hosted on WordPress
VIP, where clients would like to associate different information with a
taxonomy term (SEO meta data for categories, for example). We often will
hijack the term description field, storing in it a serialized array of "term
meta" since VIP doesn't permit custom tables.

It would be great if we could finally have this capability built in. It,
conceivably, shouldn't that much more complicated to associate meta data
with a specific term in a given taxonomy.

Erick,
Agreed. In fact, terms ALREADY have meta data (description, for instance),
although it's not stored in a separate table.

The argument here is about meta data not defined and sanctioned by the core
platform. That is, term meta that can be defined for, and used by, a theme
or plugin.

As someone already mentioned, SEO data can be associated with terms that
control the source output on a term archive page. But, of course, there are
other possibilites too.

I'm making a distinction between objects, which can stand alone, and
meta, which can't as it has to describe things that stand alone.

- Posts. Users. Links. These are "objects" as I see it. They exist
independently, and really need no meta to describe them.
- Meta. Taxonomy. Terms. These apply some information to those
objects. They have to apply to something, otherwise they're without
meaning. They must reference some object.

A taxonomy, for example, can't stand alone. For it to have semantic
meaning, it has to apply to something else. They are not objects, they
are ways of grouping objects. Their meaning comes from being applied
to other things. A term doesn't even have that much, it's really just
a string label for the taxonomy. It has no existence apart from the
taxonomy that it is labeling.

I think that things tend to just work better when you fit them into
this framework. If you start trying to treat everything as an object,
you end up with nonsensical relationship methods. Treating a term as
an object, for example, implies that you can put terms into taxonomies
themselves. Grouping the labels of other groups. This rapidly becomes
crazy and doesn't relate well to other parts of the system such as the
template hierarchy and the query system.

> P.S. Also, are you making a distinction between "Term" not being an object yet "Term Taxonomy" is an object? ?Or not?

Neither is an object.

BTW, with that said, it doesn't mean that you can't *do it anyway*.
The core code doesn't care what you put where. You can create
taxonomies of taxonomies and it'll happily do it for you. The code
itself has no relationship attached to the taxonomies.
register_taxonomy_for_object_type() doesn't care what the object type
is. wp_set_object_terms() doesn't care what type of terms you're
setting where. As long as you have an ID number that references some
"object", then it'll connect terms to that object just fine. Heck,
I've used it for the backbone of an email subscription system. Works
fine.

So you can certainly do it with the core functionality available to
you right now. It just rapidly gets complex and weird if you go that
route. IMO, of course.

While I do see the distinction you are trying to make, we'll have to disagree. 

In my experience every time I've tried to cleanly define distinctions between things and things that classify them the things start looking like classifiers and the classifiers start looking like things. It's all based on the perspective that one is observing them from and to a certain extent many uses of WordPress are myopic so that probably influences the majority perspective. But just because something describes something doesn't mean that it doesn't also need to be described; that's there the concept of "meta meta" comes from.

Drawing from my experience and applying it to WordPress I believe that anything that (practically) can have a unique identifier is an object.  So yes posts, users and links are objects but so are options, comments, terms, term_taxonomy plus sites and blogs and even postmeta, usermeta and commentmeta; they are all objects.  

Of course I know that you and I often disagree on these types of things so I'm not saying to bikeshed nor do I expect you to be swayed by my arguments (you never are. ;-)  I am just putting out on record a different point of view and making a comment that the work I'm doing (with goals to release as free GPL) will be viewing all these things and more as first class objects.

Again we'll have to disagree on this.  Forcing everything to have only one level of classification results in people building sites with structures optimized for WordPress' currently capabilities but decidedly not for their actual use-case. Further, it can add a significant data maintenance burden on the user.

But I know that WordPress will continue as is, so my comments are more projecting how a layer on top of WordPress could behave instead of advocating that WordPress itself change to suite this view because I know that is unlikely. FWIW.

The problem as I see it is one of efficiency. How many layers can you
add to the dream before falling into limbo? When you start having to
pull meta from the database, then to pull meta for the meta, you start
making more and more queries. This makes your code more complex and
fragile. Prone to breakage from new core changes. That sort of thing.

Yes, your perspective is all very database relational model and such,
but at some point, you have to sit back and re-examine what it is that
you're building here. You may have noticed that the WP database is
pretty far from 3rd normal form, but it's fast for the specific case
of serving a webpage. If you start adding layers, you rapidly build a
"correct" site, ... and which can be so slow as to be useless.

There's specific cases where tricks like this are useful, but I
consider them to be just that: tricks. One-offs. Not necessarily a
good base upon which to build a system. Honestly, sometimes it's
better to just make a new database for your specific data instead of
trying to shoehorn things into the WP data format. Depending on the
data and the use case, of course. Most cases can be fit into custom
post types and meta and taxonomies, without additional layers on top.
Maybe not all cases, but in such cases it's worth asking if that data
structure should live in the WP formats at all, or get its own custom
tables.

Yeah, this isn't going to work for the theme users though; I forgot to
mention this is a "premium" theme so there's a ton of users using this
functionality and to tell they need to add conditional templates and CSS
wont work.

What I did was built a UI on the term edit screen with colorpickers and
background image uploaders.

I use some rules to enhance the security, using atributes and rewrite:

All directories beside for wp-content, have the imutable bit set.

# cd $DocumentRoot
# for d in `find . | grep -v sitemap.`;do chattr +i $d;done
# cd wp-content
# for d in `find . | egrep "blogs.dir|uploads"`; do chattr -i $d;done

And on apache, I exclude the execution of php in folders owned by apache:

RewriteRule wp-content/(uploads|blogs.dir)(.*)\.php
http://YOURHOME/[R=permanent,L,NC]

Resuming:

Where it can write, it cannot execute. :)

*You need to chattr R -i $DocumentRoot to make updates.
*The front-end mount the $DocumentRoot via NFS, and even using root, you
cant change the attribute fron front-end.

Okay then, so you use a generic taxonomy.php file in the theme. This
will be used for all taxonomy archives.

Then, in that file, you can do this to get the term and the taxonomy:

$object = get_queried_object();
$taxonomy = $object->taxonomy;
$term = $object->slug;

Your users don't need to know how it works, nor would they need to
edit CSS and such. That's a matter of implementation details, not a
matter of UI.

I'm having a hard time grasping what you're trying to protect: developers
from themselves or core contributers.

As a developer I'd appreciate termmeta, it sounds like there are plenty of
others that would appreciate it too.

It's not exactly shoehorning, shoehorning would be trying to do something

:) ... and it would be illogical to rebuild what's already available (minus
one table) because by default the API doesn't permit it.

Thanks but I already know the basics of getting the current term object, I
do that now to get the meta for some action hooks. Maybe I'm not explaining
the feature it's implementation well enough; would thinking about the
background picker in 2010 for each term be better? Each site owner has
different locations that they create and has their own preference for colors
and background.

Apologies if I sounded like a dick. I didn't mean that at all.

Do you think if I create a patch and a Trac ticket for 3.3 we're going to
see it accepted?

No way to tell. I have my doubts, but I've been wrong before.

Database changes are a big deal. Just making a ticket and patch
generally isn't enough. I'd wait until the 3.3 feature discussions
begin and pitch the idea then. This being a fairly large feature and
all.

Thanks, it's surprising to me that this would be considered a large feature,
since it's a very small change, it's not like a new table column is being
proposed to store all the meta in JSON format :) ... but I hear you.

If anyone is interested in this being added please bring it up at the next
discussion (IRC or whatever).

Any DB change is always a big deal. Consider sites like wp.com. You'd
be adding 25 million new tables, for one thing.

You have a great point in general.  Where we differ is that you limit to one level of meta and I think we really need two (btw what we are talking about here is really meta on taxonomy, not taxonomy on taxonomy, at least not for this discussion.)  

For example, if we have posts about cities and "San Francisco" I can see having a lot of related info about San Francisco to be displayed at the "/san-fran/" URL such as a city positioning statement, a broad description, photos, a history of the city, geo-cordinates, lists of amenities, etc. etc.:

http://example.com/category/san-fran/

However as I write this it reminds me that what we have in fact is the need for a custom post type associated with the San Francisco category meaning that either having said relationship easily available has merit (or even turning term_taxonomy into a post itself.) I and others have proposed a variety of these types of things in the past on this list and on trac.  But in many cases just having meta for term_taxonomies would be sufficient.

In a nutshell, the current toolset is missing a tool and that's why this issue keeps coming up.

To be clear, I greatly respect and admire the structure WordPress has even though I came from a strict relational model. I have seen both ends of the spectrum and this that what WordPress has is scalable in complexity whereas a highly 3rd normal form database is not. The "posts" structure is the same as Drupal's "node" structure so I think that recognizes an important pattern.

In general, I also agree. 

So I don't think going all 3rd normal form is required or even desirable, I just think we are missing a few key building blocks for non-blog use-cases.

P.S. (But it's all okay by me. We are working to solve those use-cases on behalf of clients, but in a generic way and we will make that code GPL and freely downloadable once it's ready for public consumption. This is part of what I told you about when you were in Atlanta.)

I think that for almost all cases if we made a change there is 2 methods.

1. The term is linked to an (1 to 1) relationship object.
In this case if we added a column to the term that allowed us to link to a post id. Then add a postmeta to the term ID.

2. The second case is information similar to the description of the term and the original example of this thread that we could add a second column that could contan an aray that would add meta like image URLs etc. as this would only be used is a term is used it would not need to be searchable and would not need be a large load of needing an extra table.

I'm not going to get into any philosophical discussions but here are two use
case I am building right now.

1) For this project which is all about events for disabled people, I have a
taxonomy of access types. Access here meaning what kind of access an event
or venue provides for a disabled person.  The terms are 'British Sign
Language'. 'Captioned', 'Audio Described', etc. Each of those has a long
description which describes it in detail. The descriptions are stored as the
term descriptions. So far so good.
I also have a taxonomy of intended audience for the events. Mostly film
certificate style, e.g. 15, PG, 18, etc. But also 'Adults only', 'family
friendly', and then even longer terms like 'local residents only', etc. All
find so far.

However one display option for these events is a calendar listing. Where a
long list of access attributes is not practical -- many items will have
multiple access types each. So I added abbreviations using the taxonomy
metadata plugin  http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/ and
now the calendar listing is manageable, and more importantly, is not too
long and complex for disabled readers -- the intended audience.

Example 2. Really simple: I have a day-of-the-week taxonomy for another
project (radio shows). And quite simply I want to list them in the correct
order when someone searches for shows on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I
had to add a day number value using the same metadata plugin.

Finally, another example I've thought about several times, though not yet
used, and that is adding weighting to terms.  Even though they are in the
same taxonomy, some terms might carry more weight in search results.

Please say no to storing serialized arrays in MySQL fields except for in rare cases.

Adding an array of meta for that type of information would be problematic because it would disable any potential SQL querying.  That is essentially how NextGen Gallery handles relationships between galleries and albums and it makes it effectively impossible to get data sorted and filtered for some real-world use-cases (this assumes they've not added a table since I last used it.) I had to add a table to make it work for the client and I don't like having to modify plugins like that.

At the risk of making a statement that has potential leaks, serialized arrays should only even ever be used in the wp_options table where joining, sorting or filtering (probably) won't ever be required.

Sorry for this Off Topic, and sorry by my English, is not so good.

I has one blog in development, and has problems with Facebook Like and
Share buttons.

Like button: when I clicked show the number "1" for a 1 second only,
and after that, the number disappear, and the articled is not added as
liked in the facebook wall, and if I reload the page, Like button show
as never click button for this facebook user.

Share Button: This button share the article in Facebook wall, but
never show the count of shared times too.

Now Wordpress blog is in maintenance mode, but I try these buttons
without maintenance.

Somebody can help me?..

Thanks

I'm developing a *big* term meta based plugin (indeed, I've talked some 
times about it in this list). I'll name some of its features (the ones I 
can remember right now):

? Multiple term parentage. Have your flowers sorted both by type and 
color, and list all your posts on "Red Roses" category under the cats 
"Flowers>By color>Red flowers" and "Flowers>By Type>Roses".
? A term group system that allows multiple parentage for the term 
groups. Like, "Venn diagrams" and such. (Please note that you can't do 
better with any taxonomy-based system, because taxonomy-based systems 
are taxonomical; that is, they "grow like a tree": any parent (branch) 
can have any number of children, but any given children has only one 
parent. This is, one-to-many relationships. I'm talking about 
many-to-many relationships: all red roses are red flowers AND roses with 
a given color). This system of mine does not add a table for each 
taxonomy in the relationship, and thus scales far better. Because, well, 
taxonomies are really not needed if you already have some other 
hierarchy system (they are, though, imprescindible... because the 
relationships table maps to term_taxonomy table, not terms table).
?Thumbnails for terms. Sorry... I meant "featured images".
?Custom order for any given term. (We were talking about this one abouth 
a month ago...)
?Custom order for any given term when listed from another term (either 
parent or children). List Patrick Stewart as "Patrick Stewart" under 
"Actors>P" and "Stewart, Patrick" under "Actors>S".
?Label system for terms. Same for descriptions. You may use "Click here 
to see all the posts in Uncategorized" for term lists, and "Add here the 
posts that don't belong to any other category" in the admin UI 
(user-oriented design).
?Select template on a per-term basis. You don't need to copy 
category-1.php to three differently named files if you want use it four 
times: you can reuse the very same template as many times as you want 
(which, btw, is the whole philosophy behind templates, isn't it?). 
Neither you do have to go looking for IDs, or rename the same template 
used in different WP installations (same terms across different blogs 
don't usually share IDs, so this can be a nightmare to update and 
maintain). A dropdown list or a humble textbox is much easier. (BTW, 
this also enhances the versatility of themes: they don't need the user 
to rename/change/add any file, just to select different values in a 
textbox/dropdown).
?Link any term to any Page (hooking to get_term_link).
?Restrict the meta boxes and "taxonomy boxes" with a term dependency 
system. If you're not talking at all about any "place", you really don't 
need the "places" metaboxes... and not loading it is better than loading 
it and then unloading it.
?If you can allow something, you can also forbid something... so you 
could also hide parts of the admin section for the posts of a given term.
?And, obviously, do things as "lock" terms (do not allow users to unset 
or set that term), or display icons instead of text in the admin 
section. If the icons are recognizable, this may save space while being 
user-friendly (think of, say, the PEGI classification system).
?Also, make term groups "one only": allow posts to be only in one term 
of a given group. Easy to do with radio buttons. (PEGI system, again: if 
a game is for 12 or older, it cannot be for 16 or older also).
?A much more user-oriented interface. If two terms share the same name, 
the current UI does not let you know which is which, neither allows you 
to add any clue to the user. But you can use the label system, add TITLE 
attributes...
?Automatically add custom fields to any post that belongs to a term. 
Since terms and posts have many-to-many relationships (the only objects 
to do so by default in WP), you can use this with "cascading effect"
?Auto-replace terms (see "term alias" below) and autoinclude terms on a 
per-term basis (if you're talking about Seattle, you're also talking 
about the United States, though not the USA "as a whole"). This is 
specially useful with widgets. given the way that "post count" of terms 
are implemented in WP. The post count is strict: if a term has zero 
posts to it, its count is 0, even if its child terms *do* have posts 
assigned to it. If the widget was to stop listing at the "zero count" 
parent level, and the option of "Hide empty terms" was set on true, the 
term wouldn't display, even if its children have posts, because the 
(recursive) count (stopped at the zero-count parent) would yield 0.
?And well, yes, this "auto-replace" terms option can easily bring to 
property inheritance. Like if it worked like an OOP object class and 
so... ("All the includers of these term shall have a coulour, and shall 
have a name, and shall have a flowertype"). It's possible that someone 
can find this feature marginally useful.
?Incidentally, you can also have the *two counts* (both "strict" and 
"extended") with term meta.
?Link terms to term groups. That is, say, "display all the posts that 
have place-related info".
?HTML/CSS goodies like custom classes by term, or term group...
?Custom query terms. You do not assign posts to these terms: these 
return posts that comply with the specified query parameters. And this 
would be a part of the term system (which Pages aren't, so it's not only 
about displaying a query.).
?Term alias. Make a term an alias of other terms. (Yes, I know... there 
is *already something like this* buried deep inside WP, without a clue 
of how would it work, and how it's supposed to be used.)
?Link terms to anything, like users or dates. An easy way to 
multi-credit a post ("Photos by X and Z, text by T, via wordpress.com. 
Published by admin."). Or to see all the things you did write in a 
Wednesday. Or with full moon.
?Term by permissions. Specify custom permissions, roles and caps on a 
per-term basis (say, specific permissions to edit a given term, or even 
to know that a given term exists). And viceversa (require a given 
permission to see the posts of a given term. This can be done 
accumulatively and also in cascade). List all posts that require a given 
cap. Or allow exceptions to permissions on a per term basis. Or whatever 
combination of cap/cat/perm/role.

And my fav feature:

?Combine some, or all, of the above. Have a list terms widget that lists 
terms in a custom order, displaying a term thumbnail, and having a 
widget-special description in the TITLE attribute (again, this is only 
for user experience). Extra points if it's a definition list (dl, not li 
or ol) that uses term meta for the description (dd). Use the term 
thumbnails in the admin meta boxes. Have a term that adds not only its 
own custom fields, but also of the terms it "includes". Have custom 
fields by term group, term group templates. Have the alias automatically 
replace itself with the "aliased" term (This feature, for instance, 
would have save Wikipedia editor's time; there's a bit of a mess, say, 
with categories of "American Actors" and "North American Actors", 
because for many people outside the US ?and some inside, AFAIK? 
"America" means "*both* North and South America", not USA). Skip the 
alias from listings with some term-meta enabled widget.

I use term meta mostly as options work, meaning that there are lots of 
term meta which "autoload" on init (actually, right now I'm autoloading 
all term meta). This means that for all the above features, I need just 
1 query, the object cache and some parsing. (I mean that, therefore, 
termmeta are not quite like postmeta, commentmeta or usermeta as much as 
options. But it's best to use, instead of wp_options, just a termmeta 
that maps to a term_id: in wp_options we'd need additional info just to 
mark that it should map to terms.)

And when you combine term meta with a term meta enabled theme, you can 
do a lot of sweet things (mostly, again and again, very user-friendly). 
Easily change the number of columns in a template (you should just need 
to specify a single value somewhere if you just want to change the 
number of columns). Template variations on a per-term basis. Integration 
of all that custom-field-by-term stuff with templates, to sort or 
display by those keys. Or show them automatically, should them exist. 
rewind_posts() and show different subsets by term, or term group: I do 
this to make the reference for my functions (kinda a WP-powered Codex 
with wikifeatures). Have "description posts", regular posts that link to 
a term (via postmeta) and are used by it (via termmeta) as a description 
in the template. (Think of how Wikithings list their Pages and 
categories, and make it more user-friendly: users don't care if they are 
about to read "Posts", "Pages", "Custom Taxonomy Wobbly Thingie" or 
whatever. They just want all you've got, say, on red roses or naval 
battles involving the USA and Turkey during the Korea War, or clam 
cellphones with camera of at least 3Mpx, but don't care the brand, and 
in the $50-150 range). If you get many questions like that (like, if 
you're running a store or talk about lots of gizmos in your householding 
blog), you need terms like those. You can also automatically add, say, 
preselected terms to a new post in a given category. And things like 
sorting, metakeys, meta_num, additional data... are really easy to 
implement in a template. Same with stylesheets, specialty HTML header 
info that maybe couldn't be fit in wp_head, who knows... You can use a 
single Page named as category.php for an incredible lots of things, just 
with termmeta and the Page's own postmeta (again, with cascading or 
defaults/fallback effect).

Or, sort the categories/terms to use them as a description/excerpt: 
"*Review* of the *Tron Legacy* movie: *three star* rating. Looks like a 
*Daft Punk* *videoclip*". A clean description, with links to five 
meaningful cats there. (Oh, the "three star" could actually display a 
?termmeta? thumbnail of three stars. And have ?by termmeta? some rating 
microformat. First one looks nice for the users, second one is SEO good.)

(BTW: get_template_part rocks. And with termmeta, you can break down 
sections and select the "section template" on a per-term basis.)

Maybe the most important thing here is that I'm possibly using another 
paradigm on what are terms ?the old-fashioned, "wordy" way. (Which is: 
Words are each unique combination of form ?morpheme? and meaning ?seme, 
or "mix of semantic fields"?. A morpheme is not a word. Words are 
arbitrary and conventional. Different words may be homonimous ?have the 
same morpheme?. A morpheme may relate to different words ?that's 
ambiguity?. I use terms as "wordy" words.). I'm doing things this way 
because terms are the only thingies that posts can relate many-to-many. 
So, basically, by assigning posts to terms, I'm describing them and 
saying what they are, usign a hierarchy of meanings, because this can't 
be done with nothing else in WordPress (posts can only be of a single 
posttype, which do not have any kind of many-to-many hierarchy, etc.), 
and because terms are the best things in all WP to do this very job. 
Actually, it's the very job that "terms" do in other contexts ?like 
encyclopaedias or library management, like the DCU.

Best,

Xavier

PS.: For the more curious, I've got a severely outdated version of it 
working at web-warlocks.net. By "severely" I mean "one year old" in 
plugin development time... so don't take it too seriously.

I agree with the need for a custom post type in the given example. I'm
just not sure why you can't use the existing relationship methods
instead of creating something special for it.

For example, let say you have a taxonomy for your locations here.
You're applying it to normal posts. Now you have a need for something
to display the description to be used on the archive pages. For this,
I'd use a CPT called location-info or something. To then associate it
to that term in the location taxonomy, I'd simply give it that term.
Put it in that taxonomy with the term I want. Your query in the
template table to display that location-info post is then simply a
matter of retrieving the location-info CPT for the taxonomy-term that
*you're already trying to display* for posts as well. It's a natural
mechanism. Group the posts into the taxonomy and the location-info CPT
into that taxo as well.

This seems pretty universal to me. For all the cases where a
custom-tax needs a meta, because you're storing something special
about each term in the tax (like a description), then a CPT with that
term will associate it. It's simple enough to do and it makes your
queries natural. When you query, you get posts. If you query for a CPT
and the term, you'll get the post with that term. And it can let you
make multiple entries too, since you can make more than one post in
your CPT.

Yes, in many ways something special is not "needed."  We both agree that one of the beauties of WordPress is its ability to let us extend it in practically whatever way we see the need to.  

But extending for a use-case doesn't benefit more than the people who extend it and/or the few who happen to use a specific plugin.  Taxonomy metadata has been downloaded 480 times.  Said another way, 0.01% of sites are using it.  How many sites are using the infrastructure of Custom Post Types?  Over 3.4 million of them. There were many ways to get CPT-like functionality in WP 2.9, but a very tiny percentage of people used them and almost nobody built on top of them because there was no identified standard.  Yet since 3.0 was released CPTs have become a fundamental building block for people extending WP.

So when a request for functionality emerges constantly its often because there is a fundamental pattern not being addressed.  Baking the solution to that pattern into the core allows people to build on a shared infrastructure instead of having to constantly reinvent the wheel and having to build all related functionality themselves.  So when I advocate these things I advocate for a shared "standard" way of addressing a common use-case pattern, and currently only WordPress core can set such as standard.

That is definitely one way of doing it, and it is also one of the ways that motivated end-users are able to build incredible websites that work for their needs using WordPress. It is a huge benefit that WP can do this. 

But it does require a lot of data maintenance effort on the part of the end-user, and when the end-users are not highly motivated to understand how to maintain the connections (i.e. when they are 9-to-5er employees or others who don't own the site) this approach falls down.  The non-motivated users shouldn't have to know to first add a taxonomy term and then add a related post and apply the same taxonomy term, especially when the term and the related post have a 1-to-1 correspondence.  And while the data maintenance overhead might be acceptable for a website that showcase 5 major cites it would not work for sites where there there is a post for every city in the country because the data maintenance burden would be too great.

Yes, this linkage could be automated but you'll find when you start doing so it becomes overly cumbersome and complex which is, ironically the exact reason you gave for not wanting taxonomy meta.  To illustrate the relative complexities between what you propose here and taxonomy meta consider the two MySQL queries (I am using SQL just to illustrate complexity, I know WP caches data but the less complex the SQL the less complex the cache lookups end up being):

Shared Taxonomy Terms (6 JOINS)
======================
SELECT 
	* 
FROM 
	wp_posts post
	INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships ptr ON post.ID=ptr.object_id
	INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy ptt ON ptr.term_taxonomy_id=ptt.term_taxonomy_id
	INNER JOIN wp_terms pt ON ptt.term_id=pt.term_id
	INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships ptc ON ptt.term_taxonomy_id=ptc.term_taxonomy_id
	INNER JOIN wp_posts city ON ptc.object_id=city.ID
	INNER JOIN wp_postmeta cm ON city.ID=cm.post_id
WHERE
	pt.slug='san-fran'
    

Shared Taxonomy Terms (4 JOINS)
======================
SELECT 
	* 
FROM 
	wp_posts post
	INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships ptr ON post.ID=ptr.object_id
	INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy ptt ON ptr.term_taxonomy_id=ptt.term_taxonomy_id
	INNER JOIN wp_terms pt ON ptt.term_id=pt.term_id
	INNER JOIN wp_taxonomymeta ptm ON ptt.term_taxonomy_id=ptm.term_taxonomy_id
WHERE 
	pt.slug='san-fran'
    
If we want less complex then taxonomy meta is definitely the less complex of the two. And having a taxomomy meta would mean that we could add custom fields into the taxonomy edit screens and then that themes could assume it is any taxonomy meta is meta they might might want to be able to display.  

Of course themes can already display information via the linked taxonomy approach but maybe the fact that so few do it is telling?

In the case of associated posts I would then argue that we need a standard and performant approach to enable this so that the WordPress community will gravitate around the standard.  Maybe the addition of a 'post_id' field to wp_term_taxonomy?  Otherwise we just get a bunch of differently implemented hacks with no real ability for anyone to build on the work of others without bundling their plugin which itself is problematic.

So there's a need for both use-cases, taxonomy meta and related posts.  It would be nice if WordPress core could provide the leadership needed for these use-cases, but I am also long resigned to appreciate that doing it likely not in interest those who make said decisions.  (And with that, I'll be leaving this discussion for now so I can get back to actually writing the code I spoke of. :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP_Query and sticky post (Twenty Eleven)
Message-ID: <CA+yQzrgMAcEKoHeNe29LsF4DVKCKLyyVQi1UCfo7gHMaXUorxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I made a little test with sticky post (featured post) in the new Twenty
Eleven theme, and I notice something strange.

Here is the code that retrieve the data :

$featured_args = array(
'post__in' => $sticky,
'post_status' => 'publish',
'posts_per_page' => 10,
'no_found_rows' => true
);
$featured = new WP_Query( $featured_args );


With more than 10 featured post, the condition "posts_per_page" is not
respected. I have more than 10 featured post on my showcase page. So I
decided to add a new argument "paged" to my query, to specify the page I
want.

For example, if I have 12 featured posts, and a paged = 2, it only shows 2
posts. So that's correct. But if I have paged = 1, it shows me all the
featured post, and not only 10.

I made some other test, and the bug only appears when paged = 1, which is
the default value.
Is there a bug in the system ? Or I made something wrong ?

Thanks.

Tommy

Yes, but that isn't something end users should be doing. That's
something your code that implements this sort of data should be doing.

In other words, I'm not thinking of the end user ever seeing anything
I described. I was describing code and how the data is layed out, not
the user interface. If you were to implement such a thing, then you'd
show the user a list of cities, then they'd put in whatever was
needed, and you'd do the data and taxonomy and other crap behind the
scenes. They wouldn't create a term at all. They wouldn't create a
post, they'd put in the data and your code would create (or update)
the post, and apply the term to that post.

Stop thinking in terms of the User Interface. The user interface is up
to the person writing the code, how that code works behind the scenes
is entirely different.

> And while the data maintenance overhead might be acceptable for a website that showcase 5 major cites it would not work for sites where there there is a post for every city in the country because the data maintenance burden would be too great.

No greater than any other approach. How the taxonomies link locations
to their associated posts is entirely outside the realm of the
end-user.

> Yes, this linkage could be automated but you'll find when you start doing so it becomes overly cumbersome and complex

Creating a post is not complex. Creating a taxonomy is not complex.
Giving terms to posts is not complex. I see no complexity here
whatsoever. You create a new menu item, give the user a form, save the
data from that form. The hardest part is making the form for the user
to see, because user interfaces are tough.

> Shared Taxonomy Terms (6 JOINS)
> ...
> Shared Taxonomy Terms (4 JOINS)

If you're resorting to writing SQL, you're already making it fragile.
I know the traditional thinking is to only "get what you need" and to
make your queries specific. That system doesn't scale. Never has,
never will. The main problem is that there's less database servers in
the world than there are web servers. Treat the database as a data
store. Simple selects. As few joins as possible. The proper, scalable,
approach involves multiple queries. Performing two separate, but
highly fast and well indexed queries, will be faster than either one
of your query mechanisms, in the real world.

And having a taxomomy meta would mean that we could add custom fields into the taxonomy edit screens and then that themes could assume it is any taxonomy meta is meta they might might want to be able to display.

You can already add custom fields to taxonomy edit screens, and store
the contents of those fields in associated CPTs. You don't need extra
tables to do that.

> In the case of associated posts I would then argue that we need a standard and performant approach to enable this so that the WordPress community will gravitate around the standard. ?Maybe the addition of a 'post_id' field to wp_term_taxonomy? ?Otherwise we just get a bunch of differently implemented hacks with no real ability for anyone to build on the work of others without bundling their plugin which itself is problematic.

Having multiple and different implementations is a *good thing*.
Letting people find the right way is a good thing. Having a fixed way
is a bad thing.

Your idea of a post_id field in the taxonomy, for example. What
happens when I want to associate two posts to a taxonomy? How does it
work with that?

Both one-to-one and one-to-many relationships are special cases of a
many-to-many relationship, and it's better, in the web world, for
relationships to be defined in the *code* instead of in the database
structure. There's more servers running code than there are databases.
Look at the sheer number of very large scale systems that have ditched
relational data completely in favor of simpler data stores. Facebook.
Twitter. Google. They all use simple data storage models and custom
"NoSQL" systems for a reason. Having your data logic in the code
scales much better than having your data be technically correct all
the time.

I'll give you a simple example. On the wp.org support forums, you have the
ability to subscribe to a thread or unsubscribe from it. You also have the
ability to subscribe to a tag or unsubscribe from it. These are simple
interfaces. Do you see the user object getting a term attached to it with a
set_object_terms( user-id, tag-slug ) call, or the deletion of same tag on
the unsubscribe? No, because even though you're creating terms and assigning
them to a user, the interface just says "subscribe to tag".

For something like this, I'd have a cities menu. On it, you could have the
option to add a new city. In there you'd give the city a name and possibly a
slug (or auto-create the slug). You'd have a field for a description. Maybe
a map point entry. This is all on one screen, similar to the edit post page.
You'd create this screen yourself, probably. Although you could reuse bits
of the post editor page, probably. Haven't looked at that code recently.

When you hit save, the data would all go back to your code. The code would:
a) insert the term if needed, get it if it's already there
b) create or update the post (using your CPT) and stick the description in
it.
c) attach meta data (such as the coordinates) to the post with post meta
d) set object terms on the post with the term from step a

The bit in the theme to display same would be a simple wp_query loop. No
fuss, no muss. On creation of the new tag, he'd be able to use it on normal
posts too (assuming you registered the taxonomy for normal posts in the
first place), by simply selecting it in a drop down or something on the edit
post page. The user isn't taking three separate actions , but just the
obvious one. There's no "automation", as such. Just a normal interface that
they'd be able to use, and never see the gritty details of taxonomy
management behind the scenes.

Although it is tangential to the discussion, a lot of users are doing that, if the sites I've seen built by site proprietors is any indication. But I digress.

That's good in theory. But in practice it gets complicated and fragile.  At least that's been my experience in coding and why I am moving away from the approach you propose.

Curious, have you implemented such a usage for a system with a large amount of data?

I'm not thinking about the UI at all. I don't think I said anything that would have implied that.

Again, we'll have to disagree. Not in the fine terms of "is creating a post complex?" but instead related to the approach you propose being an architecture best practice; I think it is not.

You ignored the fact (which I explicitly stated) that I was using SQL to indicate the related complexity of the data storage you proposed vs. taxonomy meta, not proposing the use of the SQL.  My guess is you scanned my email but missed that statement.

Doing it the way you state it is still complex data that needs to be maintained in sync and retrieved from the database, and doing it as you propose is still more complex than a taxonomy meta would be, no matter how you slice it.

Yes is it possible, but we disagree on what should be a best practice.

Letting people find the right way is a good thing. Before a pattern emerges. 

But after a pattern emerges "choice" just creates needless chaos.  If every website owner got to choose his own protocol (vs. be offered HTTP as a best practice) then we'd not have the web we have today.

Depends. What percentage of use-cases need two?  If 7% need two and 93% need one then supporting the 93% use-case makes sense and then let the 7% use-case figure out an alternative.  (BTW, I do not know if it is 7% & 93% or 40% and 60%, but the point is that common use-cases are a pattern worth addressing.)

And if there is a common need for two then address it differently.  But not addressing it doesn't help those with either set of needs.

I thought WordPress tackled the 80% use-case in WordPress and left the 20% use-case to plugins?  Are you saying that more than 20% of WordPress sites need to scale like Facebook, Twitter and Google?  I'm sure that's not what you meant.  Taxonomy meta would address issues that many sites have, and almost none of them need to scale beyond what it could support.  For others there is Memcached, nginx, etc.

The irony is you are proposing that you put data into the database too, only you are proposing it in a more complex way using existing structures vs. in a simpler way using additional structures.  Taxonomy meta *is* name-value pairs, it's not a relationally correct model either so the reference to "NoSQL" in this context is a non-sequiter.

Anyway, this is going nowhere.  As usual on these subjects. :)

Meh. I couldn't say for sure what "best practice" is in this case. I know
how I'd do it. It'd work. It'd scale. It'd get the job done for at least 5
years, which is all my timeline really is anymore. Modern code doesn't need
to last longer than that. We're not writing in C and expecting things to
remain constant for 30 years here.

Depends on how you define "complex". My queries would be simpler mainly
because I wouldn't write a single query. I'd use existing core functions
throughout.

If you want to look at it from that angle, then roughly 48% of all WordPress
sites scale like that. Don't forget wp.com and it's 26 million sites. 7% of
the web is a big chunk of change. :)

To be clear, I wasn't referring to best practices regarding longevity for 5 or 30 years, I was referring to what makes it easy to build, launch and maintain a site today, and for the foreseeable future of the site, typically 1 to 36 months, 72 at the high end.

More complex in that you'd require more indirections in the PHP code to get there vs. taxonomy meta.

Apples and Oranges. WordPress.com is sharded; millions of individuals tables, not a few tables with millions of tenants.  
So WordPress.com != Facebook/Twitter/Google in architecture.

OTOH I do completely understand from WordPress.com why Automattic doesn't want to have to change the table structures for millions of sites. That's a valid, tangible, no bike-shedding concern.  I get that. :)

Have you tried the custom backgrounds plugin?

It lets you pick backgrounds via the post/page edit page, or assign
backgrounds to categories.

Maybe what you are looking for.

Yeah, this isn't going to work for the theme users though; I forgot to
mention this is a "premium" theme so there's a ton of users using this
functionality and to tell they need to add conditional templates and CSS
wont work.

What I did was built a UI on the term edit screen with colorpickers and
background image uploaders.

Very nice, good work!

I've tested with data from two real sites using verbose rules, and the
improvements are huge.

On the worst site url lookup is 30 times faster and rewrite rules
flush is 2000 (!) times faster compared to unmodified WP 3.2.1.

Full numbers in trac.

Hey folks-

It's been brought to my attention that when a site a recently worked in is viewed via google cache, there is a whole list of mostly porn related links that have been added to the bottom of the pages that obviously do not exist on the page. My questions:

1) how does this happen? Host related malware?

2) what us the best way to go about fixing this.?

Sounds like cloaking to me. Its possible the website may have been comprised
and attacker injected the code which only lets search engine view the links.


You should check the files. If you have done a simple grep search, attacker
might've obfuscated the code. You can try changing your user agent (via user
agent switcher adding for Firefox)  to googlebot and visit your site again
if what I say is true.

I can remember two times where clients of mine discovered similar things 
with their sites. In both cases, they were running outdated versions of 
WordPress.

Just a friendly reminder to always stay current and make sure to tell 
your clients to do so too.

It most likely is the Pharma hack from the sound of it. It was 
definitely popular last year, but it hasn't gone away. We're still 
seeing it daily but in varied capacities. The string mutates constantly, 
and is still very relevant.

There are plenty of resources online to clean it up as noted. The thing 
to make sure of is that you find/remove all of the backdoor files that 
usually come with the malicious payload. This can be painful because 
they vary considerably. They vary in name, size, code base, insertion 
points, etc. The malicious payload is usually more obvious and simple to 
find, but if you don't clean up the backdoor files, you're likely to get 
reinfected. At minimum, the risk is high for recurring issues.

Hope this helps,
Dre

Great. Hard enough explaining to my client this isn't really my fault once. I'm sure two or three times down the road it's not going to get much better. The SEO hit is what's really going to be hard pull to swallow.

Well, I can't get into who is at fault or not here, not sure your role. 
I can however tell you that typically this happens when the site is 
running an outdated version of software (This string is not exclusive to 
WordPress). Variations of the attack happen through FTP credential 
hijacking (Don't use FTP, use a secure alternative like sFTP/SSH. If you 
must, don't save your credentials in your client), others we've seen 
have spread because the hosting provider has no business being a hosting 
provider (Choose your home wisely).

A lot to consider. What I recommend is ensuring their software is up to 
date, and stays that way. Secondly, but just as important, make sure 
they are using very strong passphrases, it will help mitigate the risk.

The SEO hit isn't as bad as you'd think, if handled quickly. Not sure 
how they've been affected already but it doesn't take too long to get 
cleaned up all around.

You need to make the site secure, and absolutely clean up properly.

If you can't make the site secure because of the hosting -- move hosting.

If you cannot guarantee to have cleaned up, pay an expert to do it for you.
It's probably a better use of your time and money if you don't have the
skills yourself.

It is possible to have a secure site, with an up-to-date WordPress, good
plugins, themes, and the right measures in place.

I host more than 70 sites, some for more than 8 years. Some are big targets.
None have ever been compromised.

It's a new wordpress install with 301 redirects from the old HTML site. Not older then two weeks - Old host though.  

Thanks for the help.

I had some of my WordPress sites hacked, couldn't 100% confirm the
security flaw, but beleive it was a combination of using Filezilla and
saving passwords (Filezilla saves the passwords in text format, no
encryption!!!) and not updating an Adobe Internet Explorer plugin on
the PC I use to connect via FTP!

Fortunatly keep regular backups so didn't cause long term damage, but
changing around 170 passwords (100 FTP, 70 WordPress logins) isn't a 5
minute task!

Best way to manage that David is to use a password manager:

http://keepass.info/
http://lastpass.com/

These are just two examples.

Can you ever really 100% verify the breach? I do use lastpass...

You would still have to change 100 FTP passwords and 70 WordPress passwords
even if you use a password manager.

Hi Justin,

I got hacked with this last year. It's a nasty one, but (touch wood)
my site seems OK at the moment). I wrote a short article about it with
some useful links:

Hope you get it sorted.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Advice on providing plugin support
Message-ID: <1310737471.2368.17.camel@polo>

Holamigos,

I provide support for a plugin I wrote. Currently I funnel the support
requests into a WordPress post on my blog, and ask people to post
comments with their requests.

I'm now up to about 1000 comments between a few posts. It works ok, but
there's no way to search the archive. So, I get the same questions over
and over. I'm working on expanding the FAQ, but people seem to miss it.

I also follow posts on the WordPress.org forum which are tagged with the
plugin. However, this suffers from the same problem, there's no way to
search the history.

Ideally, I'd like to force users to search before posting a new
question. When they type their question, I'd like that to be used to
auto search the history, and hopefully, present useful answers before
they submit. A little like GetSatisfaction for example.

Are you a plugin author? How do you provide support? Do you have any
recommendations? Does GetSatisfaction or another tool work for you?

Thank you in advance for any advice offered.

Love & joy - Callum.

Callum,

Yeah, I'm in the same situation with my plugins. I host respective pages for each plugin where people can post questions. And I monitor the wordpress.org forums for items posted related to the plugin. For each release I update the page content with notes on new features and new functionality. But you know what? I found people/users really don't like to read. When a user comes to my site it is generally because they are stuck and possibly under a deadline. So they are scanning for answers. 

I thought about doing away with the comments and force users to post to wordpress.org forums. At least that way the information is housed within a single system. But as you mentioned it is harder to search. Another thought for my own site was to hack the comment form so that I can provide a dropdown where the user can select the version of the plugin. Then users would be able to filter the comments for things related to a specific version of the plugin. But my worry with this approach is the user submitting the comment will not bother to properly set the version. If you are like me you may get plenty of comments from users like 'I installed you plugin and not my site is broken. Help!!!' no other information is provided about which WP version, theme, other plugins, etc. 

I know there are some paid services out there how will help manage comments and provide some hand-holding. I've not investigated this because I don't make any real money off my plugins. So can't see adding out of pocket expenses to provide support. When I have time I triage the comments. When I have tons or client work I let then sit. Sometimes other users provide how-to replies that seem to solve the original commenters questions. 

I'd be interested in seeing other's comments.

The WPORG support forums are a great solution, especially if the Plugin is
hosted by WPORG. Each hosted Plugin (and Theme, for that matter) has its own
dedicated forum, with its own RSS feed, which makes monitoring quite
simple.

Also, if you can direct users to submit their support queries directly to
the Plugin's dedicated forum, the topic will be auto-tagged, and the subject
auto-appended, with the Plugin slug and name, respectively, which makes
searching considerably easier.

FYI: to find your Plugin's dedicated forum, go to the Plugin's Extend
listing page, and look in the lower right-hand corner for the "Write a new
topic" link. If the forum already has topics posted, you will see them
listed under "See what others are saying".

Chip,

Yes yes, I'm aware of the wp.org support forums. All my public plugins are hosted at wordpress.org. But all that does is give the user a listing of topics related to that plugin. There is still no way to allow the user to run a secondary search for a topic within that plugin listing. Only the title/subject is display. 

For example one of my plugin, Media-Tags, have the forum listing http://wordpress.org/tags/media-tags?forum_id=10 I know of at least 3 different topics related to using my plugin with the eShop plugin. But how can a user looking for support of the plugin related specifically to eShop filter the listing? The global search in the top right of the page is for all of wordpress.org.

When looking for content on the wp.org site I pretty much always have
to resort to google.
Not saying this is a good thing, or a bad thing. I've just found from
experience that the site search will miss many results that google
finds.

Course, training people to use google search *AND* manage to type in
site:wordpress.org (let alone a monster string such as
site:wordpress.org/tags/media-tags) is neigh onto impossible.

Regards,
Claude

Hi,

Same problem here, even went to the trouble of dedicating a domain to
one theme and still have the same questions asked, though not as bad
as put a lot of the answers on the options pages for the theme with
links directly to seperate posts about specific settings (still 400
comments since Feburay)

What would help would be a plugin that allows searching within
comments, had a plugin that added comments to the search, but it would
only list the original article which wasn't much help. So if someone
searches for XYZ in the standard WordPress search form it lists
specific comments with a link to them, not looked for anything like
that for a while, wonder if one exists now.

If plugin authors post links to their FAQs & documentation in their
readme  so that these links then appear on their WPORG plugin page, I'm
sure the regulars on the WPORG support forums would happily direct users
back to them.

<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/> is a good example
of this, in my opinion and I've posted those links a lot. But
asking a WPORG support volunteer to start searching through your site
for documentation might be pushing it a little too much.

Auto-appended subjects also make it a lot easier to distinguish WPORG
plugins from "other sources". The former are more likely to get some
basic troubleshooting help from forum volunteers as well.

Callum Macdonald asked:
> How do you provide support?

eShop has its own forum on quirm.net and we do try to push that support
link out via the plugin too. Right now, I'm running 95% of the support
and I have to be pretty draconic with thread management to keep it under
control.

> I'm working on expanding the FAQ, but people seem to miss it.

We've also got a ton of documentation that I'm always adding to. And, 
yes, it seems that many people don't bother to read before posting but 
at least I can answer many initial queries with a quick link copy'n'paste.

I've been doing some form of IT support for about 20 years now and I'm 
not sure that there is a perfect support solution. It all boils down to 
a few simple processes, a lot of wrangling and the option to be able to 
say "Sorry but I've now done all I can to help" in some situations.

Got a chance to scan the infected site. Found many of the usual Pharma  
suspects base64_decode functions, base64-min.js files, eval etc...  
Looks as though they live mostly in plugin folders child function files.

Haven't scanned the database yet. Ugh.

What's interesting, is when switching to User agent within Firefox, I

Subject: [wp-hackers] Production site with localized mirror
Message-ID: <CAJmHdULh8VTKnOxVjcpwoFUhLhasf-2bsg=dfVZiW-Y5Sgg6mg@mail.gmail.com>

We'd like to set up a local mirror of our WordPress site that the staff can
use to post content quicker without the overhead of the production
webservers and to prevent against outages, since the website feeds the print
edition of our newspaper. This is the setup we were thinking:
https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1VJSBJViRfeeKeq0H5D8kPVlquna29akmrxINBzhxbqQ/edit?hl=en_US.
Basically, all writes from the local install would of course be synced back
up to the master db on our production servers, and most reads on the local
install would come from the local slave, except in instances when the delay
between the master and slave would be too noticeable (such as on
wp-admin/post.php).

There are a few potential problems that I'd like to clear up to make sure we
don't screw anything up too bad:
* Can we define the local install as internal.bangordailynews.com using the
WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME constants without affecting anything on the
production side?
* Can we also safely turn of multisite in the wp-config on the internal
server without affecting anything production side?
* We are planning on running memcached on the local server and using
W3TotalCache locally, as we do on our production site, to ensure the db
doesn't fill up with transients, for example. Are there any concerns doing
this?

Is there anything else I'm missing?

Thanks in advance for the help.

New information has come to light. At first, All things pointed to the  
Pharma Attack. I scanned the site, found many of the "base64"  
functions, eval and common strings associated with the problem. As I  
started cleaning things up, I realized that many of the potentially  
new malicious files and potentially compromised files had not been  
modified since I had installed WP and the theme it self... Hmmmmmmm,  
something doesn't add up here. I started sniffing around for other  
potential problems.

As it turns out my client had downloaded his theme from the following  
source for FREE.

http://themecrunch.blogspot.com/2011/05/kaboodle.html

This theme is a Woo network theme and once I was made aware that it  
was downloaded for free I became very suspect. I went over to woo  
themes and as I suspected it is NOT free.

http://www.woothemes.com/2011/04/kaboodle/

I do plan on purchasing the legitimate theme from Woo Themes and  
comparing.
In the mean time my question... Are rogue / spammy themes common?

Do you think most (many?) people who visit the support forum for a
particular plugin know that?

Why not have a bbpress forum on your site and direct all faqs and support requests there?

The copy of Kaboodle you mention does indeed include spam links in 
/kaboodle/functions/admin-functions.php buried at line 5772

I wouldn't trust any free themes that are not downloaded from the WP.org 
repository

Good luck with your clean up efforts.

I could not find a theme named kaboodle in the WordPress Theme Repository.
 Also, this is best directed to the theme Review team (who I have cc'ed)
rather then WP-Hackers.

Hi all,

what's the best solution to develop a website in sandbox? Obviously
the best solution could be to work in local but I need a way to
develop new features already online (because my client wants to see
them) and test them in sandbox mode. After that only when features are
tested can become final and ready to go online.

What's your opinion about that?

Thanks

Pasquale, it's fairly common to use a secondary subdomain such as wwwtest. or even a subdirectory with a unique install of WP in it for testing like this. As long as the new features are developed as part of the theme or plugins it would be easy to relocated after you've received approval. Chris

Hi Christopher,

thank you for your suggestion.

Certainly this is a good solution, infact I thought about that but I
hoped there was a better and more sofisticated solution.
This answer generates another question: does exist some ide
wordpress-oriented? For example a special plugin for Eclipse, Visual
Studio, NetBeans or something like that.
I think it's very frustrating to develop a plugin or to customize a
theme editing the code using html textareas :-)

Thanks

If you put your plugin on GitHub you get a very clever bug tracking  
system. It is searchable, allows comments and labels, and you can close a  
bug via commit message.

You can use the wiki pages for the FAQ and other docs.

Since themes and plugins are portable, you can develop locally and upload to an online site for testing and demonstration. I actually version-controlled like that once by adding the version number to the theme folder and style.css and just leaving all of them on the testing site. Each shows up as a separate theme, so if you mess something up in the latest version it's nothing to revert to a previous theme and take the latest back to the workbench.

?
Best regards,


David

I have a multisite set up that I use for developing on. Each client gets a URL and we build the site on there. Then once everyone is happy they can either point their domain to the multisite site with domain mapping or install WP on their domain. It's no biggie to export the content and then copy across the theme and any plugins. Works for me. :-)

Thank you all! :-)

Probably for the moment I will simply try to develop in a subfolder or
in a subdomain, maybe using a WordPress multisite installation.

When I will be less busy than now  I will try PhpStorm + Zend
Debugger. I really need a framework/ide to develop WordPress websites
in a high level programming environment.

Thank you for your time.

Message-ID: <38060a4c-f394-4852-af14-871ce0d58e99@10g2000yqn.googlegroups.com>

I would like to ask if someone knows if the Compatibility voting &
Plugin rating will be improved in the future (Didn't see this on any
roadmap) ?

After more than a years I can say that the information (for my plugin)
is currently useless : During an upgrade cycle I receive 15 voting
after 20.000-40.000 downloads, very often just some frustrated user
are giving their "broken" vote.  1700 ratings after 3.5 Mio downloads
is also not really representative. So I feel to vote/rate via wp.org
has a too high barrier... I'm looking into some improvement that this
should be done out of WordPress itself ( as initial considered here :
http://wordpress.org/news/2009/10/plugin-compatibility-beta/ ).
Hopefully this create more feedback from users.

Message-ID: <814DFAF9-A578-460A-833B-2C84D228C9BF@graymerica.com>

This is how we do it.

We set up three versions of the website online:

Development
Staging
Production

We then work on the development copy and and make sure we keep a punch list of all the DB changes.  These can be plugin settings, WP settings, pages/posts/etc added to WP, user level settings.  Basically anything that needs to configured or changed on the new version.

We work locally, FTP up changes to the development site as we work.  We keep all the local files in either dropbox or SVN depending on how big the client is and how many developers are working on it.

Once the site is approved by the client on development, we check everything into source control.

Then we test the deployment to the staging server, apply all the changes from the punch list.

If the changes to the staging site do not break anything, we wait till a slow time, or late at night, make the site "Members only" and deploy the changes to the live site, do everything on the punch list and hope we did not miss anything.

For the database, we just copy the live database to the staging and development servers and change the URL with an entry in WP config.  I normally avoid plugins that keep the URL in their data.   Since most sites have content that is altered by the client, we keep the images and upload paths pointed to the development server.  This way we do not need to move all their images to the development site.  We then go through and update the settings to point to development API Keys, FB apps, and other settings.

Personally, this whole process is one of the most annoying parts of using WP as the basis for websites.   The idea that all the urls are hardcoded all over the place in the db still boggles my mind, but I have heard it from the mouth (in person) from those in charge that this will never change.

We also develop custom apps in Code Ignighter, and I would never in a million years, hard code the URL of the deployment  into my DB.  We also have switches in the config that changes values based on if the site is in development or not.

In WP, things like the FB app id, email addresses, active plugins, and tons of stuff needs to be changed on a development version if you want to actually debug your website.

My opinion is, the lack of smooth, standardized deployment tools, is keeping WP from being a serious contender for an application development and enterprise software product.    Even Magento is easier to move, and that is saying something.

I am constantly trying to improve our process so we can have fewer surprises on deployments (since they happen late at night), and what works for me, may not work for you, but since this topic comes up on this list every month, it is obvious that the development -> staging -> production workflow is an issue.  

If I had my druthers, I would build some sort of versioning system built into to WP that allowed themes, plugins, and developers to register transformations that needed to happen in a new version.  Imagine if you could just increment the version number of your theme or installation and fire off the creation of new widgets, pages, menu items, etc from a standard set of scripts.  Then a unit test method to ensure your changes do not break something.  

Or, let me check in all my wp-options changes into source control and apply them when I commit.

If you build a site one time, on your local machine, and then launch it, it is no big deal, but if you are like us and have multiple developers working on sites for clients that want major changes constantly and have no tolerance for downtime, then it starts to be a pain.   

thanks for taking the time to read my whole post, or just skimming it,

I agree with Andrew. I hate seeing those URLs hard-coded in the database,
too! Moving WordPress (especially a multisite network) is too hard.

For those "in charge" : Is it true that this will never change?

Thanks-

This is extremely annoying, yes.

I often (when it's feasible) start the staging & production installations
from fresh, install all the plugins & themes (where all the custom code
should be), and import the posts from the wordpress back end. There are
still issues to be fixed, but I've found this to be a bit less painful.

Another thing - in stead of dropbox/svn/cvs I use git. I create a repository
on each server (keeping deployment accessible to only one admin - access is
via public keys). I then create custom post-receive hooks that copie
everything checked into each repository into the proper folders. On each dev
machine a "remote" section is created for each server.

Managing these is then a question of git push dev; git push stage or git
push live (if I have access to live)

I know it can seem hard, so I even quickly threw my WordPress single sub-directory to WordPress multisite cheat sheet out there. You can strip out about half of it, but it's really not as hard as it appears. I know there are folks working on solutions either in plugin or script form. 

http://funroe.net/blog/2011/07/incomplete-cheat-sheet-for-moving-a-single-wordpress-site-to-a-wordpress-multisite/

The URL is one of the best name-spaces out there. It's supposed to be a unique address on the internet, so finding and changing it is pretty easy. If WordPress has all the proper filters in the right places it should be as easy as pie either in a plugin or like my convoluted step-by-step.

wondered what effect they had, as I move data around occasionally and never
saw any evidence of effects.  I'm pretty careful not to use full urls in the
content, so that's never a problem.

For local development, I often just set up a virtual domain on my local
linux server, and point my hosts file on my development machines to this
domain.  Then, to access the real site, I just remove the entry from my
hosts file.  Usint this method, I can often completely replicate the remote
site, so I don't have to worry about accidentally uploading a configuration
file that I shouldn't.  But more often lately, I simply change the ".com" to
".dev" for local development, and then I can work on local and remote at the
same time, and do an easy search if there is an accident.

Bill, I don't know what the answer is regarding if/when it'll change but it's an easy override for you if it bugs you. This code will replace occurrence of your url address in your text with a relative path. I'm sure somebody out there has a better function for it but it's done the job for me over the years.

c.

function thisismyurl_clean_static_url($content) {
	return str_replace('href="'get_bloginfo('url'), 'href="', $content );
	return str_replace('src="'get_bloginfo('url'), 'src="', $content );
}
add_filter('content_save_pre','thisismyurl_clean_static_url','99');

Quoting Otto [1] :

"From the interface side of things, it's not used for anything at all.

However, internally, it's possible to create terms that are aliases of 
other terms. These terms will then be in the same term group, showing 
that they're really the same term.

There is no real use for it at this point. It's there for potential 
future functionality and for plugins.

If you are a plugin programmer and know how WP works, then you can add 
an alias_of parameter to the call to wp_insert_term(). The alias_of 
specifies the slug of the term that the new term you're inserting will 
be an alias of (and so which will share a term_group). Same parameter 
works on wp_update_term() too."

Term aliasing is one of those things that nobody really uses, but it's
left there because there's some ideas floating around it that could be
useful for somebody.

Basically, the idea is to group terms together showing that they're
related or similar or the same or something. For example, if I went to
/tags/wordpress then maybe it'd be nice to get posts with the tag "WP"
as well. If those two terms were in the same group, then I might be
able to do something like that.

Marking terms as aliases is there and works. How you can use that term
grouping is not really in there at all. That's more advanced
functionality that needs to be fleshed out and rethought before
becoming core code.

Interesting, I wonder if this would have added benefits for SEO for

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_terms & post_type
Message-ID: <4E2213EA.7000400@braydon.com>

I've setup a site that uses shared post_terms across all post_types and 
need to be able to get the terms that are specific to one post type. 
I've looked at the documentation of get_terms and didn't find anything 
available, I've read the source for get_terms and didn't find any 
actions or filters to be able to work with the where clause.

I have found this article on the net with a way to do it 
(http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/14331/get-terms-by-taxonomy), 
but it seems overly complex, when all that is needed is an additional 
SQL WHERE in get_terms.

Does anyone know of other ways to do this without modifying the core, or 
is that the best way to go about this?

I've also submitted a ticket for a feature request #18106 on the trac 
(http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18106)

There's quite a difference between a "term group" (just what WP 
so-called "taxonomies" are) and a term alias (that redirects, or means, 
another "parent" or "main" term). "Similar" is a different thing of 
"Identity" (being the same) and both are quite different to "related". 
If wp and wordpress (sorry, no uppercase danging in slugs) are aliased 
(meaning that "wp" is alias of "wordpress", *and obviously not vice 
versa*), you should never, ever, be able to assign posts to *both* 
terms, because that's asking for disaster.

Besides, the "term group" thingie, as designed/slightly implemented, 
doesn't show which is alias or synonim of which. I sincerely doubt that 
"making terms as aliases" really "works" because *no term can be 
actually alias of any other term* with the column system. That is, *they 
do not know who they're alias to*. (How can an alias system possibly 
work with that?) Terms may, at most, share a value in a non-API-ed 
column in the table... which is linked to no term at all. It just keeps 
score of how many "term groups" area already in the table, but that 
doesn't point to any term (and if you're pointing to no other main term, 
*you're making no alias*, don't fool yourself). That just "floats". So 
it's actually a (numerical) "taxonomy" set in the wp_terms table, with 
no API and number value instead of string. But there are already 
"taxonomies", which is the thing that WP core uses, so that column is 
absolutely useless. Also the term API is heavily dependant on taxonomies 
?the "term groups" and, ahem, "alias" you're talking about, have no 
mention to taxonomies whatsoever, and have no way to reference it 
because the "term group" are supposed to refer to the number of term 
group, not term_id, not any term_taxonomy_id nor taxonomies. And term_id 
may map to multiple records in term_taxonomy (though it's a mess and a 
bad idea to do that, yes, but it's possible, and more feasible than the 
"term group" column thingie).

So the term_group column marks the terms as having some kind of unnamed 
relationship, which by no means can be an alias (synonimia/redirecting) 
relationship, and that you have to specifically define by hardcoding it 
somewhere. And are site-exclusive (the number of the very same "term 
group" can be different across sites). But that doesn't matter much, 
since you've got also to code all the rest of the API...

It's far more efficient to implement term meta and with a single field 
(or two for taxonomy and term_id, if you don't want to store serialized 
data), assign any term as alias of another term. Then, you can hook any 
operations to terms, and see if the term you're working with is alias of 
another; and if it is, you may redirect to the aliased term template, 
link to the aliased term link, and even substitute the alias term for 
the aliased term in wp_set_object_terms. I know because I've done that. 
(Also, you can get things the other way, that is, you may know which 
terms are aliases of any given term).

(And using groups with term meta instead of taxonomies, btw, can also be 
pretty more efficient that using taxonomies, even if "taxonomies" are 
already built in. You may just get the IDs of the terms, and have 
hundreds or thousands of term groups, and still add just another 
instance of the term_taxonomy_table, not hundreds or thousands of them. 
A "group" that has hundreds of terms, with no subdivisions, is hardly 
manageable or useful at all: the term parent id would be much more 
meaningful and detailed than the "taxonomy").

That's another of the use cases and features for term meta I explained 
the other day, back when you were asking for them, and you paid no heed. 
See, there are other people thinking out there, too, so maybe you'd need 
just to listen sometimes instead of rethinking.

So, yes, mark another to go for term meta.


Best,

Xavier

I use a dedicated forum on my own site for handling support for my wporg
plugins. As users have to register to post, I like to think that only those
who have read all the documentation actually bother to post. (Who am I
kidding???? :-) ). I also like having all the posts under my control - only
a self-hosted forum can provide this.

I provide an extensive FAQ, lots of configuration and set up info on my site
too, but most people don't read it. However, I feel it is better to provide
documentation and put up with lazy users, than provide no documentation at
all.

Personally, I don't enjoy using the wporg forums, and I try to discourage
users from seeking support for my plugins there. Some people may not like
this attitude, but I feel I can provide a better service to users on my site
than elsewhere.

Are any of you folks using an FAQ plugin to build your FAQs based on user
submissions? I know there's a couple out there, could be a nice addition.

Ultimately, my thoughts are that if the user wants priority support, then
let them purchase a support ticket at whatever price works for you, and deal
with those. Triage the rest as per Paul's comment.

Cheers,
Alastair.

Subject: [wp-hackers] filter the_content without affecting the_excerpt
Message-ID: <4E25DD18.2060902@philipwalton.com>

In my theme I'm adding a filter to "the_content" to insert social 
sharing buttons at the beginning of each post, but then when I call 
the_excert() the text of those buttons is showing up.

I know I can just write another filter on "get_the_excerpt" to remove 
them, but that just seems wrong.

Is there a way to filter the_content without affecting the_excerpt?

We use a lot of post meta and taxonomies on our website, including in the formation of the permalink. We query them all over the place, which seems exceedingly inefficient. I'm wondering if there's any big drawback to getting all of a post's postmeta and terms right off the bat and putting them in the post object rather than querying the db every time.

In normal WP_Query calls, meta and terms are both pre-loaded and
cached in memory by default *if* you're using an external memory based
object cache such as memcached or similar. By doing this, they can get
loaded into the object cache and thus these rather heavy queries don't
happen every single time.

However, if you're not using such a memory caching mechanism, then
yes, it doesn't load these on the query, since they're heavy. This
relies more on late-loading. They're loaded when you first need them,
then saved in the object cache in case you need them again. If you
know that you will need them in advance, you can just pass
'cache_results' => true to your WP_Query and the meta/term info will
be preloaded and object cached. Later hits for them will go straight
from memory.

I highly recommend performance testing this heavily before deploying.
Loading these advance isn't necessarily the best way to go in all
cases, and in the case where it is (with persistent object caching),
it's the default.

Thanks Otto. I'll do some investigation. We are using object caching via memcached, but it seems we're still not loading all this in advance and moreso that the same queries are being run multiple times. Any ideas what might be causing this?

No, they are only pre-cache if you are *not* using an external cache.
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/14665
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12611

Even if they're not cached in the external cache, they should still be
cached in memory, and I don't think they are.

Long ago (probably around the WordPress 2.0 days) I wrote some scripts
to assist in maintaining WordPress setups like this:

https://github.com/ufwebadmin/WordPress-Maintenance

I recently updated them to support WordPress 3.x and multisite setups.

You can configure each target, like dev, test, and prod, with
information on where to deploy it and how to connect to the database.
Deploying is just a matter of typing "wp_deploy.pl -e dev".
Synchronizing the databases is just "wp_sync_database.pl -f prod -t
dev".

While the scripts don't handle updating attachment locations, they do
update the wp_options table with the appropriate siteurl and home
values.

If I had to start all over again, I would probably go the same route
as Adriaan with git and post-receive hooks.

I got around this by doing this by doing this and run it on both the 
"the_content" and "the_excerpt" filter without it appearing twice.

function my_content_filter($content) {

     global $post;

     if ( !is_feed() && (is_singular() || is_author() || is_category() 
|| is_front_page() ) ) {

         // do stuff to $content

         return $content;

     } else {

         return $content;

     }

}

So, I've spent some time digging through the source, and it appears the 
wp_trim_excerpt() function applies 'the_content' filters to the excerpt 
by default. And it looks like there's no getting around it.

Can someone please explain the rational behind not differentiating the 
two? Why should I be forced to apply my content filters to my excerpts 
as well?

The purpose of wp_trim_excerpt is to create an artificial excerpt if
one doesn't exist for the post. So it applies the content filters to
the content, then trims it down to create the excerpt.If there is an
explicit excerpt on the post, then the content filters will not be
applied to that, nor will the content even get pulled.

So if you're adding something to the beginning of the content, then it
will be in the created excerpt. This is by design.

If you don't want it to do that, use a shortcode to insert your
content. Shortcodes get stripped from auto-created excerpts.

I understand that for many if not even most situations, anything you add 
to the content you probably also want to add to the excerpt. I get that.

My issue is that it's impossible to not do it this way. It would be 
great if there were a filter for "after_the_content" or 
"post_the_content" or something like that allowing you to just filter 
the content and leave the excerpt alone.

Having wp_trim_excerpt() filter "get_the_content" instead of 
"the_content" makes more sense to me, though I understand it's 
impossible to change it at this point.

I suppose a relatively painless solution is to create your own 
the_content() function and add another filter yourself that the_excert() 
won't apply

For example:

// calls the_content() and adds an extra filter which the_excerpt() 
won't apply
function pw_the_content($more_link_text = null, $stripteaser = 0) {
     $content = get_the_content($more_link_text, $stripteaser);
     $content = apply_filters('the_content', $content);
     $content = str_replace(']]>', ']]&gt;', $content);

     // apply the filter 'post_the_content'
     $content = apply_filters('post_the_content', $content);

     echo $content;
}

Then use call pw_the_content() instead of the_content() and you should 
be fine.

Depending on your desired outcome, how about adding your own filters at 
a different priority? You can add a filter that runs at an earlier 
priority, and use that to remove the default filter.

   add_filter('get_the_excerpt', 'cancel_trim_excerpt', 5); // run at 
priority 5 instead of 10
   function cancel_trim_excerpt($content) {
     remove_filter('get_the_excerpt', 'wp_trim_excerpt');
     return $content;
   }

In your case, I think you said you're prepending share links, and the 
HTML is getting stripped from the excerpt, leaving you with bare text 
that has no purpose? How about:

   add_filter('get_the_excerpt', 'no_share_links', 5);

   function no_share_links( $content ) {
     remove_filter('the_content', 'add_my_share_links');
     return $content;
   }

   // fancy-schmancy: add the share links to the excerpt anyways:
   add_filter('the_excerpt', 'add_my_share_links', 20); // run after all 
the other filters

Is that what you're trying to do?

Using a "the_content" filter to add a shortcode sounds like the cleanest 
way.

the_excerpt() is an inflexible template tag to begin with, in order to 
modify it's output length, and other parameters, you need to add a 
filter that applies to every time the function is called, where it may 
only be necessary to modify it once, not on every instance the function 
is called.

Hi,
Function save_mod_rewrite_rules() at line 122 of wp-admin/includes/misc.php
does nothing if the current site is multisite.
I'm trying to implement a plugin that handles some rewrites and they should
be written in .htaccess file.
Is there any other option there?
Shouldn't we put an do_action( 'save_mod_rewrite_rules' ) there until there
is no way to regenerate a htacces multiste?
Thanks

Hi!,

I'm developing a twentyeleven child theme. I have created some custom post
types, and one of them is called 'photos'. And because I wanted to customize
the archive for this custom post type, I have created the template:
archive-photos.php. It was going perfectly, excepts for one thing: the
functions the_content() and the_excerpt() are not working properly in this
template. If I use echo get_the_content(); it works fine. I wanted to know
if it has happened to someone else before.

Thanks!!! :)

Anybody have a suggestion for how to split the dynamic_sidebar() into groups?

I have a theme that uses dynamic_sidebar() to display widgets across the bottom as a footer, but I want to include a CSS to clear the div's between the third and fourth.

I'd suggest to make different sidebars. It's easier for users and more
robust.

My worry is that the footer only has the width for three widgets, if somebody adds a fourth it will wrap but not always to the start of the second row.

For example if the widgets look like:

111111   222222   333333
111111   222222   333333
111111   222222   333333

The fourth widget will wrap like this:

111111   222222   333333
111111   222222   333333
111111   222222   333333

444444
444444
444444

But if the third widget is short, it'll wrap like this:

111111   222222   333333
111111   222222   444444
111111   222222   444444
                                  444444

What I want to do is insert a clear:right; after the third widget. Which will look like:

111111   222222   333333
111111   222222  
111111   222222  

444444
444444
444444

If I know what it is, I can do it using the specific widget name but when users can add anything, there isn't an ID or class for 'widget-3', so ... is there another method?

My thought instead of trying to figure how many widgets go across the row of the footer and forcing a break. Why not add some JS which will set the height of all those widgets to the same. That way they will 'flow' to the next row as needed. 

Here is some jQuery I put together for a Property listing prototype for a client

// Spin through all the class items. Figure out the tallest. 
var grid_cell_max_height = 0;
jQuery('.portfolio div.property-summary').each(function() {
	var cells_height = jQuery(this).height();
	
	if (cells_height > grid_cell_max_height)
		grid_cell_max_height = cells_height;
});

// Now set all to the same height. 
jQuery('.portfolio div.property-summary').each(function() {
	var cells_height = jQuery(this).height(grid_cell_max_height);
});

You could use jQuery to add a class to the third list item

I've seen that symptom when $post isn't globalized (e.g. "global $post") 
-- make sure that's not the issue.

After successfully using the $wp_editor function built by Ozz, my tinyMCE
fields are now not updating the hidden textarea upon form submit. Any ideas?
Just updated to 3.2.1, downgraded, same problem.

Thanks,

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress multisite user creation
Message-ID: <CANqqJr58VNkdimdzw1TUCFcvhD-M2KsJ-QUrWz3-b=fmdOp2iA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on setting up some WordPress multisite instances but have
hit a roadblock with respect to creating users. In short, the code for
validating network usernames is fairly restrictive.

Much of it is possible to modify via a plugin. I've put one together
which I'll be registering shortly:

https://github.com/dwc/network-username-restrictions-override

However, there is one restriction that is hardcoded:

https://gist.github.com/1105744

Is there a particular reason why the strtolower is forced there? The
default multisite filters are configured to perform this anyway as
part of the sanitize_user process.

Message-ID: <CACzEXcMCyRkNuq1jDGcp7GoTsHdo3PGM3TBmGf0KrA55Na+Ahw@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a custom PHP project built on CodeIgniter.

Would it make sense to use BackPress for an easy SSO implementation between
WordPress and that site?

The idea is that someone logged into WordPress is auto-logged into that
other site.

Also, that a user logging into that site, is auto-logged into the WordPress
site.

If they were both WP sites, I could use shared cookies and some
wp-config.php vars to specify the "master domain", etc. But what's best
here?

A penny for your thoughts ;)

Hi Alister!,

in your situation I would change your custom PHP project to WP and will have
both sites in the same network.

So, if both sites are running in the same WP multisite, the auto-logged for
all sites of the network is sorted out.

By the way, you can use the plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/ if you want
to map any of those blog/site on a WordPressMU or WordPress 3.0 network to
an external domain.

Hope it helps :)

I'd say so, since all you really want is the authentication classes.
Including WP would be too much overhead for this.

Additionally, Rocio's suggestion of changing your CI project to WP
instead is probably impractical, and I doubt you'd actually gain
anything substantial from it anyway.

Thanks,

I would agree.

BackPress contains all the code you need to have SSO from your other project against the WP User tables.

On the topic of BackPress, is it still going to be maintained despite
the conversion of bbPress to a plugin?

There are dozens of blog posts and tutorials about how to pass values 
to JavaScript scripts and they all tell you to use wp_localize_script().

In my mind the these tutorials weren't necessary if there would be a 
core function called "wp_pass_params_to_script()" or something like 
this. This function only needs to be an alias for wp_localize_script() 
but it would make the code much clearer and save the time of many 
developers searching for the correct function.

After looking more into this the get_terms function would need to be 
modified greatly to support this, since it requires joining two other 
tables, that I didn't realize on my first read of the source. Here is 
the SQL if anyone is interested, it's limited in parameters, but it does 
the job.

Alistair, that's a really excellent suggestion. I really like the idea
of charging for paid support. I'm not sure why I never thought of that
before!

A user enters their question. The system searches for an answer,
hopefully finding it automatically. If not, the user can choose to post
their question publicly as a free question, or can pay and optionally
make their question private and get premium response.

Interesting...

Thanks to everyone for sharing their thoughts. Sounds many of us are in
the same boat. If I find any wonderfully simple solutions, I'll post
them back here. :-)

Love & joy - Callum.

Message-ID: <CACOUsBXCtJa-5mk4BRMP1VLwj7Ceb2CLmtHXznWmURtnQubXmQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have written a small bit of code that would (hopefully) allow me to
select the best or most appropriate category for a post. For a post
with just one category this is easy. For a post with multiple
categories this requires a smart system of some sort.

Never mind that. My problem is in trying to figure out how to properly
pass the $categories object through the do_action system.

The code is something like the following:

in single.php

Sorry about the aborted send of the previous version of this question.
The new version of gmail has a hot key that sends an email. Haven't
figure out what the hot key is yet. :)
So every now and then a partial email gets out the door.

I have written a small bit of code that would allow me to
select the best or most appropriate category for a post. For a post
with just one category this is easy. For a post with multiple
categories this requires a smart routine of some sort.

My problem is in trying to figure out how to properly pass the
$categories object through the do_action system.

The code is something like the following:

in single.php
<?php
$categories = get_the_category();
global $gxxaxx_postcategories;
 $gxxaxx_postcategories = $categories;
foreach($categories as $category) {
    echo $category->slug . '..<br>';
}
?>

in functions.php

function gxxaxx_getbestcategory_handler($categories) {
        global $gxxaxx_postcategories;

        foreach($categories as $category) {
                echo $category->slug . '...<br>';
        }
        foreach($gxxaxx_postcategories as $category) {
                echo $category->slug . '....<br>';
        }
}
add_action('gxxaxx_getbestcategory', 'gxxaxx_getbestcategory_handler', 10, 1);

For a post with a single category the result of this is something like:
design..
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
design...

For a post with multiple categories the result is something like:
design..
hosting..
design...
hosting...
design....
hosting....

It looks to be that the do_action is modifying the nature of the
$categories object for a count=1 versus a count>1 array of categories.

Is this normal?

I was trying to avoid the use of globals.

Regards,
Claude Needham
p.s. If this approach is totally out to lunch please advise. However,
I would also like to know how to properly pass values in the
do_action.

I am facing this problem at the moment. I've tried everything already

The problem occurs in file category.php. Apparently the layout is perfect,

global $wp_query;

$paged = (get_query_var('paged')) ? get_query_var('paged') : 1;
query_posts(
array_merge( array('posts_per_page' => 5, 'paged' => $paged),
$wp_query->query

I'm using WP Pagenavi plugin for paging ....

Could someone help me?

I need an advanced book on Wordpress that explains the database
and hopefully has a lot of examples. I am not very good with PHP
and as I understand the wpdb class has numerous functions
that are unique to the class.
I need a good review of how to send data from a form to a new form
and capture it all in a database. I have been told that the gravity plugin
handles this very well. Anyone else here have dealings with the gravity
plugin?

Message-ID: <4E301FF5.7090408@gmail.com>

Hi hackfolks,

I'm the developer behind a portal called youngcaritas.lu and I have a
questions concerning plugin "placements"

For e.g: we use a little range of plugins to simplify for handling the
website, and those plugins, add their javascript code in the <head> tag,
but as yslow says I should put all my javascript into the footer of the
page, I'm trying to reach this goal and I wanted to ask, If I can
override the place they want to put it in with an add_action().. or
another function, does anyone knows a resource where I could lookup this
or has some code for me?

Would be great!
Cheers

Are the Plugins adding their scripts using wp_enqueue_script(), or are they
simply outputting hard-coded <script> tags, hooked into wp_head?

Drikinha of my heart, you are using array_merge to preserve the query
pattern and add some parameters, right? Have you tried using $query_string,
as shown in the codex, rather than merge? Type:

global $ query_string;
query_posts ($ query_string. "posts_per_page & = 5 & page = '. $ paged);

Reference: # http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_postsUsage_Note

You could paste the code portion where the plugin is called? Sometimes the
position of wp_reset_query () called for plugin influence on the paging and
last.

Could it be that your default $wp_query is using 10 posts per page (set in
Settings > Reading), but your custom query is using 5? When you load the 3rd
page WordPress goes to the database and looks for posts 21-30 and if there's
any found it will then load your template, which is querying 5 posts (so on
page 3 it's looking for 11-15). If you have less than 21 posts, it will
return a 404 before getting to your query.

Ways around this:
- Set the default posts_per_page to 5 in Settings > Reading
- Use hook pre_get_posts to set the default query to 5 posts per page in
certain instances (ex: if (is_category()) )

Hello Bill...

If I can not handle the amount of results in a customized manner for each
type of category, is not cool

I always used array_merge() to customize the amount of results and it always
worked perfectly ...

I'll find out more about the hook pre_get_posts ... I think this will help a
lot ..

Thank you for your contribution!

I need an advanced book on Wordpress that explains the database and
hopefully has a lot of examples. I am not very good with PHP and as I
understand the wpdb class has numerous functions that are unique to the
class.
I need a good review of how to send data from a form to a new form and
capture it all in a database. I have been told that the gravity plugin
handles this very well. Anyone else here have dealings with the gravity
plugin?

I've looked at several books over the past couple of years, and the biggest problem with them is that they're out of date before they're published. WordPress changes pretty frequently, too frequently for books to keep up IMO.

The Codex is really the best source, plus there are a number of bloggers out there who offer up-to-date tutorials on how to work with WordPress' innards.

If you're not very good with PHP, then that will be a handicap, and it might be worth looking at a book to help you with that end of things. With a good understanding of PHP, most of WordPress is very straightforward.

Hope this helps,
Josh

Subject: [wp-hackers] Question about do_action & its handling of arguments
Message-ID: <CACOUsBXZ4Zibzo7StVJRxiRO5VewodZ96HoiPpYSMPR6Kj2_Og@mail.gmail.com>

Can someone provide a little insight on why do_action is handling
arguments in the following fashion?

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.2.1/wp-includes/plugin.php
386	        $args = array();
387	        if ( is_array($arg) && 1 == count($arg) && isset($arg[0])
&& is_object($arg[0]) ) // array(&$this)
388	                $args[] =& $arg[0];
389	        else
390	                $args[] = $arg;

It looks to me like the fundamental nature of the argument I am
passing changes depending upon the count.

This means that when I use foreach in the action handling  function
the nature of the iteration changes depending upon the count.

I would have expected the arguments to passed through the function in
a transparent fashion.

I'm curious what situation is being made easier by do_action's current
approach to handling arguments.
And, I'd like to know the best practices for handling the argment in
order to account for its change depending upon the count of the
original array.

Regards,
Claude

This is to work around a PHP issue.

If the argument being passed into the function is an array with an
single object in it, then that if statement pulls the object out and
that's the argument.

Objects can get cast into arrays quite easily in PHP. This is
basically to prevent that from happening.

So if some code calls do_action('whatever',array(&$this)), then what
the action functions will receive is the object $this, not an
array($this).

Quite helpful.
That helps explain the reason for the code.

I was wondering though, what is the best way to handle a situation such as this.

$categories = get_the_category();
do_action('gxxaxx_getbestcategory', $categories);

function gxxaxx_getbestcategory($categories) {

	foreach($categories as $category) {
		do something with $category->slug;
	}
}

If the post has more than one category this code works fine.
If the post has only one category then the code fails.

Do folks normally test on count?

if (count($categories) == 1) {
	do something with $categories->slug;
} else {
	foreach($categories as $category) {
		do something with $category->slug;
	}
}

This works for me. But, it seems like I'm missing some obvious php
thing that would be more standard.

I'm trying to convert my writing style to fit wp best practices so
that I can better learn wp and my code could better integrate into the
wp community.

Thanks again,
Claude

Thanks William and Josh

I read somewhere that Wordpress has it's own query functions like
get_results() get_row()

I'm still sorting out why I can't show an array from the $wpdb I tried
foreach but get an error

A good tutorial would be to be able to list all the tables in the database.
Anybody seen that?

Several possible workarounds.

One, check for the object case and adjust it properly.

if ( is_object($categories) )
 ? ? ? ?$categories = array($categories);
foreach($categories as $category) {
 ? ? ? ?do something with $category->slug;
}

Two, pass in an extra argument to avoid the casting case.

do_action('whatever',$categories,1);
add_action('whatever','functionname',10,2);

Three, pass something other than the categories to begin with.

do_action('whatever',$post->ID);
add_action('whatever','xxx',1);
function xxx($id) {
  $cats = get_the_category($id);
  ...
}

thumbnail from 150x150 to 100x100, when I upload a new image, only the 
files with the dimensions in the filename are created. In other words, 
let's say I have image1.jpg. After I upload it, this is what I have on 
the server

image1-100x100.jpg
image1-300x300.jpg
image1-1024x1024.jpg

but not image1.jpg. I tried to deactivate all my plugins and to use the 
default theme, just in case, but it didn't help. Any thoughts?

Cheers,
Dino.

I agree with Josh that most books will be out-of-date, but IMHO the
Codex also lags behind development, so I would like to suggest to use
the WordPress source code in combination with a tool such as phpxref[1]

[1] http://phpxref.sourceforge.net/

ps: I you want to develop plugins and to a lesser extent themes you'll
need at least a basic understanding of PHP (and html/javascript) and the
ability to write it from scratch. It probably wouldn't hurt to have some
experience with database such as MySQL as well.

I doubt much happens with this ticket in any case.
In reading the http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Apr/535 article
it appears that the big vulnerability is the fact that admins could
upload php code to their own wordpress site.  One shudders to think
about the possibilities for exploiting your own site if you have ftp
access.

Seems a little like a security risk on *your* wall safe because *you*
know the combination.

Admittedly most hacked wordpress sites are caused by the admin doing
something silly or neglecting to do something important. However, I
don't think the solution is to remove the admin ability to either edit
template code, or block downloading and installing plugins.

I must be missing something, cause it sure looks like April 1.

Regards,
Claude

That phpxref was an excellent suggestion Bjorn

You could write a little plugin and hook onto plugins_loaded or use the 
theme's function file, then wp_dequeue_script the offending script and 
enqueue them in the right place.

Hullo all,

Just wondering if anyone knew of, or has, an admin library which
provides some degree of abstraction when creating common elements,
such as drop downs, forms etc. This sort of stuff would be very
useful, and I don't want to re-invent the wheel if there is something
out there I am simply not aware of.

Thanks a lot.

The first thing that comes to mind are Django forms:

CodeIgniter has a similar concept - https://github.com/benboi/ci-form-framework

This is basically what I am looking for, but for WordPress - I think,
if memory serves, someone was trying to do such a thing a few months
(years?) ago.

All the best,

Alex

A very talented PHP engineer friend uses the PHP Zend library (not the 
framework) a bunch. I just looked to see if it has any abstraction for 
forms, and it does: 
http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.form.quickstart.html The Zend 
library includes a bunch of classes, so it's difficult, but possible, to 
use just one part of it.

Thanks all.

These all look good - having had a quick look, particularly at the
Stack Exhange thread, seems that
http://github.com/scribu/wp-scb-framework/ - seems this is the most
comprehensive and pitched at the right level of abstraction for a
developer who wants to roll something out quickly.

I am sort of surprised as WordPress becomes more powerful this sort of
thing isn't built into Core.

All the best,

Alex

I use phpHtmlLib for forms within WordPress.  The 3.x branch of phpHtmlLib
went off in a direction of a PHP MVC Framework but the 2.x branch still
works fine.  It has a whole slew of classes for constructing and working
with forms as well as some useful widgets for displaying content.

I had used phpHtmlLib on a project prior to working with WordPress so when I
started on my Swim Team plugin (which is very forms intensive) I was loath
to code a bunch of forms by hand.  I ended up turning the 2.x phpHtmlLib
branch into a WordPress plugin, you can find it in the plugin repository.

The examples on the phpHtmlLib site are no longer there but if you install
the plugin and visit
http://yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/phphtmllib/examples you will see a
list of example forms and widgets.  There is also a doc directory.

I didn't write the original library but I did contribute to it later on and
did the work to turn it into a WP plugin.

Thanks all.

These all look good - having had a quick look, particularly at the
Stack Exhange thread, seems that
http://github.com/scribu/wp-scb-framework/ - seems this is the most
comprehensive and pitched at the right level of abstraction for a
developer who wants to roll something out quickly.

I am sort of surprised as WordPress becomes more powerful this sort of
thing isn't built into Core.

All the best,

Alex

As I saw in changeset 18490 that wp_add_script_data() was dropped again 
and the function wp_localize_script() was resurrected "for historical 
reasons".

What about my proposal to just add an alias for wp_localize_script() 
for the reasons mentioned in my first posting? For people new to 
WordPress programming this would make it easier to find the right 
function.
