Subject: [wp-hackers] Menu input validation
Message-ID: <CAOESKLYR3f0xR+QrJCNJVQvPeJBu=cB_paRKr5nN+bS6dKs6wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm confused in which way I need to implement input validation
for icon fonts markup in a custom menu field.
The basic idea is to validate and restrict the input
for icon font tags only - e.g. glyphicons and font awesome.

I've detailed my question in this github issue along with screenshots and
code:
https://github.com/cristovaov/wp-bootstrap-navwalker/issues/1

Thanks in advance for the help, improvements and your time.
greets,

-Cris.

Hi all,

I am a  wordpress theme developer, I had a problem when i upgraded my
clients my wordpress version from 3.7 to 3.8.1.  The problem is when my
clients press ENTER to give a line space to any post in visual text. Its
doesn't get effected on the live website. When I tested, I found wordpress
3.8.1 gives a default &nbsp space when we press enter, in text window thus
its doesn't effect in live url. So ,how can  I have effect of wordpress 3.7
version i.e when i press enter i should give a new line space.


Thanks
Pushpendu

Message-ID: <534427B5.90300@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi list,

we were recently informed that someone was selling our plugin (available 
for free on WordPress.org of course), WP SlimStat.

While this is allowed by the GPL license, they re-branded it as Keyword 
Swarm and removed all the references to the original author.

On top of that, they purchased all our premium add-ons and bundled them 
with their package, even if our license agreement explicitly says that 
you cannot include any of our premium add-ons
within a free or commercial theme or plugin or other package.

This will end up damaging not just our small group, but the entire 
community around our plugin. If the already little revenue stream is 
choked, we won't be able to invest our time to improve WP SlimStat, 
which is sad.

So I thought I would come to this list to ask for opinions.

Thank you,
Dino.

Hi Dino,

Maybe the best option would be to get in touch with the FSF for such
issues. They would provide good counseling and advises.

Anyway, thanks for telling us.

Yours sincerely

FSF will not do anything about it, maybe a mention not do develop on GPL2
if you don't like that. Other licenses open source are protecting authors,
but that means developing on other platforms.

"...even if our license agreement explicitly says that you cannot include

So your commercial WordPress Plugin add-ons - add-ons for a Plugin hosted
by WPORG, and that are promoted on
WPORG<https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-slimstat/>- are not distributed
under GPL?

The licensing you use really has nothing to do with it. They would violate
your license even if it was more restrictive or less restrictive. People
pirate games and business software and such too, right? This is really no
different.

The long and the short of it is that you're basically dealing with the
problem of software piracy. There is no solution. There isn't going to be a
solution. At most, you can call a lawyer and sue the offenders for damages,
which is difficult to prove at best. And even then, you probably won't get
any real money out of it.

In the long run, I think that the only way to really cope with this sort of
issue is to sell something else; something which is not software.

If you have never read it, give The Magic Cauldron a read. I like Chapter 3.

We've had do deal with this on our plugins as well. The best way we've
found to deal with it is to develop hosted services that work in
conjunction with your plugin ... the most direct of which is support and
updates that are only available to paying customers.

The best thing you can do, in my opinion, is to keep making a great product
and forge ahead. Users have bought into the value of your software and
direction it is going. When someone forks your software maliciously, that
fork rarely if ever runs parallel to your original vision and passion for
making that software. It will, in time, divert from the origin intention of
the first developer or team. A good fork is when software diverts from its
original intent and value, and a course correction needs to be made or
there can be added value in another direction. A bad fork almost always
leaves the users out in no man's land.

At the end of the day, you are the one who had the idea, you've own it, and
will continue to have a passion for it. Someone who comes in and copies
your work won't have the same passion, vision and forethought for roadmap,
they are there for a quick buck. They most likely don't understand the
software as thoroughly as you do as well. When support requests begin to
pour in (and they will as they do for all WP plugins), upgrades need to
happen, etc..., they will buckle at some point and abandon the software. If
you stay true to your principles, give your users security that you aren't
going anywhere, they most likely will stick with you. The ones that abandon
you will come back at some point when they see the other is just a fraud.

Knockoffs are never quality anywhere you look. Those who steal ideas always
cut corners and make a substandard product. It might look like your product
now, but it won't in the future. Make your's even more awesome to get ahead
of their 'fork'. Dig in and refactor your codebase if need be so they can't
just plug and play with your updates. Offering a quality product, excellent
support, and a great vision the future of the product will pay off. My two
cents. :)

Have you ever heard of Easy Digital Downloads or CodeCanyon? :) We 
basically use the same business model, which seems to be in compliance 
with the whole GPL/WP business. Am I wrong?

Ultimately, all legal questions are resolved by lawyers and by court 
cases. Up until that point, nothing more than hot air exists. I like to 
do a bit of armchair punditry as much as anyone... but none of it 
changes the game being played on the pitch.

I say this as someone with every sympathy. Regardless of GPL issues (and 
all my WordPress products are 100% GPL, whether free or commercial), 
some people will see an opportunity to leech money from your hard work, 
and you need a strategy for that that is more than "tell them they're 
not allowed to". That's an overly optimistic strategy on this side of 
the end of the world.

In my view, the two main safeguards are a) continuous innovation b) top 
quality support. If you keep doing these, then the amount of new 
customers, and the purchases of happy repeat customers, will offset your 
losses to the leeches.

Best wishes,
David

Hi,

Is it allowed by the license to remove the original (Dino's) copyright
notice and replace it with their own? Is it allowed to deprive their
customers of their own right to redistribute?

If they remove attribution, they're in violation of the license, so
their license is void.

If this is the case, here's what I'd do:

1. Send them a DMCA request
2. If they don't respond, send their host a DMCA request directly
3. If *they* don't respond, send their registrar a DMCA request (they
probably won't do anything, but might contact the host and tell them to
respond)
4. If nothing has happened still, send Google/etc DMCA requests to get
them removed from search results

----

DMCA is the most powerful tool you have, but it only applies if they've
removed attribution. If they add attribution, unless there are other
license violations, you can't use the DMCA.

Also note: If your premium add-ons contain copyrighted resources (not
PHP, since that's covered by the GPL; images or CSS aren't automatically
though), you can also use that.

I recall this question coming previously but  I must not be phrasing my
Google query correctly because I can't find an answer.

I have WordPress running in a Virtual Machine which I use for development.
 The majority of the time this works well for me.  However, there are times
when I find myself without an Internet connection (e.g. yesterday on a 5+
hour airplane flight) where I can still get work done locally but WordPress
is verrrrrrrrrry sloooooooow because it is constantly reaching out for
resources (e.g. Gravatar, WordPress.org update server, etc.).

Is there a setting or hook or something that will cause the external
connections to either fail much quicker or not be attempted at all?

Mike

You need to setup that way your virtual machine. Depends on what you use.

Hi,

Hack your VM so the WordPress.org, etc. domain names will resolve to
nothing. Another option is to prevent DNS resolution at all so it will
simply error out.

You want it to fail instantly instead of failing late (after finding out
your VM can't reach its DNS server...)

Yours sincerely

Add this to /etc/hosts in the VM:

127.0.0.1 wordpress.org
127.0.0.1 api.wordpress.org
127.0.0.1 planet.wordpress.org

It should cause your dashboard to fail basically immediately. :)

There was a line that you can add into wp-config that will block
external requests. Not sure if that still the case.

This is the sort of solution I was looking for.  I don't want me VM
permanently set to ignore these connections all the time, just when I am
not online.  Does such a thing exist in wp-config.php?

This looks like it will do the trick, I will try it on the plane later
today.

Thank you all for your messages. We're looking into all the options 
mentioned on the list. We'll probably also display a message within the 
plugin's admin screens to explain what is happening, so that users can 
go get their refund from those guys ;)

Best,
Dino

For what it's worth, you were told twice starting all the way back
from Mar 3rd by both Eric Johnson and Aaron Douglas to request
feedback from the #wordpress-mobile IRC channel or the Android mobile
forums <http://android.forums.wordpress.org/>, and were even told to
try contacting Maxime Bais (and where to find him). It doesn't look
like you did any of the above.

The number of slots allotted is not made public until the students 
selected are announced by Google on April 21st, as the number changes 
during administrative de-duplicaiton of applications. Comments on 
applications are left by mentors when there are questions and/or if they 
need more information from the student to form an opinion of the 
proposal. Not all applications get comments.

I'm just curious, in this WP query, what is the number "5" referring to?

[request] => SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS  wp_posts.ID FROM wp_posts  WHERE
1=1  AND ( (
                    SELECT COUNT(1)
                    FROM wp_term_relationships
                    WHERE term_taxonomy_id IN (31,32,33,34,35)
                    AND object_id = wp_posts.ID
                ) = 5 ) AND wp_posts.post_type = 'post' AND
(wp_posts.post_status = 'publish' OR wp_posts.post_status = 'private')
GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10

Not 100%, but I believe that 5 is being compared to the count from the
term_relationships.

There shouldn't be more than 1 result in that query for any single
taxonomy_id.

And there are 5 taxonomy_ids in the IN clause.

So I think it is returning those posts with ALL 5 taxonomy_ids.

So if a post only has 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 of those tax_ids, they are ignored.
Just if they have all 5 for that post is it included in the return set.

Hi,

Check line 1158 of wp-db.php - "<h1>Error establishing a database
connection</h1>"
I guess you can change from there.

No filter, but the template can be overridden... and that could send an email.

// Load custom DB error template, if present.
if ( file_exists( WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/db-error.php' ) ) {
	require_once( WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/db-error.php' );
	die();
}

See line ~1388 here:
https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/1860b6a007c568b50344d113fe6490713479ad6a/wp-includes/wp-db.php

On multisite you can filter wp_die() to check for that message and alter it/send an email.

@Shumail Mohy-ud-din, modifying core like that is not recommended, because
the change would have to be redone each time a WordPress update is
installed.

@Nicholas Ciske, that works perfect. Thanks for the tip.

However I would like to hear from the experts on what the best practices

In other words, how do you keep your dev/stg/prd databases in synch?

I personally haven't had the chance to get it yet, but I'd highly recommend
the Migrate DB Pro plugin(
https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/). Although as I took a
look at their prices, I'm kind of sad :( The
developer version used to be like $100 for unlimited sites. Now it's $200
and limited to 100 installs(you can deactivate the license on any of your
sites, but still).
I would still say that even though it's much pricier now, it's still going
to make your life a whole lot easier. It has pull/push that is pretty easy
to use. They recently added a media add-on that allows you to sync your
media files as well.

Usually I would do one of the following things:
 - Use Migrate DB(the free version) in order to get a DB export with new
URL's and then upload it to the target server
 - Download a DB copy through phpMyAdmin, upload it to the new server and
if possible use wp-cli's search-replace command

They're both more time consuming, but right now I can't toss-away about 7
to 10 hours of paid work time just to get the plugin :)

I would like to be able to save a file similar to how WP does, but instead of the file size at the end of the file I want specific words.
Best I can find via searching online is: https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Image_Editor
And frankly I don't know if this is right or much less how to use it.  Even the examples online are not very flushed out.http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/91038/how-can-i-use-wp-save-image-editor-file-filterhttp://qandasys.info/hook-for-saving-an-image-after-editing/
Basically, I want for a custom image size the file to save instead of -300x300.jpg to be -small.jpg
Ideas?

I have started using Migrate DB Pro. It is definitely the best solution I
have found.

A paid service like https://managewp.com/ might also be good, but I haven't
really tried that.

It has been an ongoing issue for us to keep the databases synced quickly.
Migrate DB Pro has been the first good solution we have used. It can also
sync your upload directories. It costs money... For us it is a really small
amount when we compared it to man hours lost dealing with these things.
Expecially when new people come on to a project.

Once you set it up. You just pull and push somewhat similar to GIT.

Message-ID: <87mwfkrlqy.fsf@newcastle.ac.uk>



I've been trying to follow this advice, to update my plugin version
Tested status:

"If your plugin is compatible, you don't even need to release a new version --
just change the readme value."

Now I think that I have done this. My readme.txt reads:


Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.9

http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/kcite/trunk/readme.txt

And, yet, the webpage says "3.3.2"

http://wordpress.org/plugins/kcite/

Rather confused. Have I done something wrong? Or do I need to update the
readme on the latest tag?

http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/kcite/tags/1.6.3/readme.txt

I am guessing not as this read "3.3.1".

Or does it just take a while.

Yeah, you need to update the current stable tag. There can also 
sometimes be a delay between when you update SVN and when the plugin 
repo updates, so wait at least an hour if you don't see it taking effect.

Having said that, I just updated a few about an hour ago and the repo 
reflected the changes immediately.

For pulling down from production to staging or production to a local
development environment, I use mysqldump and rsync. I have custom
Vagrant commands on my local environment that automate this. The
procedure is to have a command that SSHes into prod, makes a mysqldump
(use -r, not to-file redirection operator >) to a
NON-WEB-ACCESSABLE-LOCATION, then rsyncs the dump file to the location
(either staging or local), and runs the db import command. You could
also leverage WP-CLI for this on either or both ends (wp db export and
wp db import). I actually prefer to NOT gzip the dump file before
transferring, and then I make sure to enable the -z flag in rsync.
This is actually more efficient in my experience, because if you
already have a recent-ish dump file on the destination, it won't
transfer the whole thing, but will do a diff, and then compress those
changes on the fly. With a binary compressed format, it'll probably
have to send the whole thing every time.

Next, I rsync uploads from prod to staging. I don't do this to local
dev if there are more than a gig or two of uploads ? instead I just
have my local VM's nginx config proxy static file 404s to the
production server. In the local VM, I'm using the production domain
(pointed to my VM), so no URL rejiggering. On staging, which has to be
publicly available for clients to inspect, I use this to change the
domain on the fly:
https://github.com/markjaquith/WP-Stack/blob/master/WordPress-Dropins/wp-stack-staging.php

I've also used output buffers on the whole page to do that swap for
other things.

This is pretty straightforward. What's trickier is when you want to
migrate content from staging to production. RAMP is a solution. You
could also just write migration scripts as an mu-plugin or as WP-CLI
scripts and run those.

Right now I'm working on a plugin that solves this issue? lets you hit
"record" locally, make changes, hit "stop", and get a PHP export of
the changes that you can check in, and will run on deploy. Hoping to
get that done in the next couple months.

I havent tested this, but it appears you can specify a filename yourself
using get_output_format().  Looks to be one of the accepted methods for
wp_get_image_editor().

So maybe something like :

function adams_image_mod( $path, $args ) {
    
    $upload_to = wp_upload_dir();

    $img = wp_get_image_editor( $path );
        if ( !is_wp_error( $img ) ) {
            $rename = $img->get_output_format( 'some-new-name' );
            $saved = $img->save();  
            
            if($saved) {
            	
                wp_update_attachment_metadata( $id, $data );
            }
        }
    }

    return $img;

}


I didn't test this, its just an example - but Id imagine that is what the wp
devs put that in for.  (make_image() and save() also accept filename args. )

Hi

If your question is about changing the size affix for images filenames
I've been wondering about this for some time too and have these links to
share:

http://bhoover.com/wp_image_editor-wordpress-image-editing-tutorial/
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/123240/rename-image-uploads-replacing-width-and-height-in-filename-with-medium
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/82193/rename-image-uploads-with-width-in-filename

Haven't got round to work on it so interested to know how you get along.

Greets,

-Cris.

Hi all, just a quick update on this issue, for those who might want to 
go through the same process.

  As suggested, we sent a few DMCA Takedown Notices to all the services 
involved.

Once Mr. Blagodarskly (the guy who's selling our plugin) got a copy of 
those notices, he replied with a counter notice affidavit.

Apparently, if he does that, our only option would be to seek "a court 
order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity 
relating to the material on the service provider's system or network".

Oh well...

Dino.

That's crap. If he's ripping off your work and selling it, and counting 
on you not being willing/able to put in the resources to fight for your 
proper rights that not only screws you, it sets a bad precedent for all 
of the rest of us.

If you want to set up a fund to take contributions to go after this guy 
I'll be the first to pony up a bit. I've benefited immensely from the 
amazing community around WP and I'd hate to see people like this start 
to put a damper on everyone's willingness to share their knowledge,

Dino,

I don?t have any direct experience with this, but the http://www.fsf.org/ and http://www.gnu.org/ might be able to offer advice on this matter, if not actually be able to help connect you with a lawyer who can help act on the matter.

Sadly, their GPL violation page is really vague http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html , and I don?t think they?ve got deep pockets, but worth a try. I say this because it?s likely important for the organization to establish and support legal precedence for license enforcement, so cases like this may be of interest.

Hi Cris - 
Thanks for those links.  
ialocin's code in the second link: http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/123240/rename-image-uploads-replacing-width-and-height-in-filename-with-medium worked out.
I added a default case with just img_size['width'] to catch any possible custom image sizes that don't need a small/medium/large name replacement.
I also rearranged the file naming to filename-wordSizeInsteadofImageSize.extention.
This code seems to add and delete the created files correctly.  
I'm going to work on modifying it some so the small/medium/large images are put in their own directors under the standard year/month of the uploads folder.
Thanks all for the help.  Solved as of now.

Apologies as I'm sure this is not the correct place to ask this question.

I've not checked in a long while. This morning when I go to my profile on
wordpress.org ( https://profiles.wordpress.org/pmenard/ ) I no longer see
my plugins listed. If I check the plugins individually I'm still shown as
the owner.

To where/whom should I post this issue?

Thanks in advance.

Paul

See these posts on Make Community: http://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/profiles/

Especially this one (http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/04/10/profiles/):

Usually something like this would be reported on meta trac: http://meta.trac.wordpress.org/

It?s odd that your plugins aren?t showing. I was just checking out the new design earlier today, and noticed that mine were there.

Your plugins are not showing because your readme.txt files contain
incorrect information.

Example:
https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/simply-exclude/tags/2.0.6.1/readme.txt

You have this line:

Contributors: Paul Menard

>From the example readme.txt file:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/readme.txt

Contributors: (this should be a list of wordpress.org userid's)

Your user-id on wordpress.org is "pmenard", not "Paul Menard". We actually
parse those files in order to build information and do all these things
with the data. Bad data in = bad results.

Change that to "pmenard" and two main things will happen:
- Your profile will show those plugins
- Your plugin pages author info in the sidebar will show your picture and
name and link to your profile

Additional: If you change your Display Name here:
https://wordpress.org/support/profile/pmenard/edit

Then that will get picked up and used instead of "pmenard" for the name in
the sidebar on plugin pages, even if you use "pmenard" as the Contributors
line in the readme.

Example:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/pluginception/

Look in the sidebar under Author. Has my full name. But the readme.txt has
this:

Contributors: Otto42

Which is my username.

Eventually, we plan to integrate the /support/profiles page with the
profiles w.org pages, but we're not there yet. Profiles should eventually
become the single place to control info about your w.org account.

Being on that topic, my username contains a dot("nikolov.tmw"), but the
slug to my profile obviously doesn't -
http://wordpress.org/support/profile/nikolovtmw .
My plugin http://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-separate-comments/ shows
my picture and picks-up my "display name as" setting(Nikola Nikolov), but
the plugin is not listed on my profile page. Is this related to the
migration that's going on, or I have my
readme.txt<https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/qtranslate-separate-comments/tags/1.2.2/readme.txt>misconfigured?

Actually, your plugin is indeed listed on your profile. Click the Plugins
link on the left hand side:
https://profiles.wordpress.org/nikolovtmw

Usernames that include things like periods should definitely include those
in readme.txt files as well. The contributors list should contain usernames
as-they-are, not what the slug for them ends up being. I believe that
capitalization matters too, but I may have already fixed that somewhere.

In the future, we'll likely disallow odd characters in newly made
usernames, for simplification purposes.

Oh, okay. I got confused, since the link to my profile from
wordpress.org/support/ (the one that says "View your profile" is actually
going to https://wordpress.org/support/profile/nikolovtmw instead of to the
one on profiles.wordpress.org - I just missed that part. I guess at some
point this link will be updated. Nevermind then :)

Hey,

The best solution would be extending WP_Image_Editor and creating your own.
What you then do is changing the method multi_resize(). You could then pass a better filename to the method _save().
This could then include the variable $size what is the name of the image size.

Best,

Marko

Message-ID: <CAK3PZGtgCcxgOpZJnaUY4DBDzhreA33AAPO1k1vefPRGoc=EPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have large amounts of CSV data (around about 7k rows) to import, each row
being a new post (CPT) and various meta fields.

I can open and print out the contents of the file to the browser fine, but
I just know running that import will time-out.

Within a WordPress plugin, how do a run a large process like that? And even
better, provide some kind of 'percentage complete' feedback to the user?

Thanks,
Alex

You break it into chunks -- usually via ajax requests (or meta-refresh if you cant to go old school).

Basically, you make a call to process X rows, that call returns when it's done, you update the % done accordingly, then make the next call to process another X rows.

As long as each call completes within the timeout (be conservative for crappy shared hosting), you just keep hammering away until the import is complete.

The WooCommerce CSV importer is a pretty good model for this (not free, but solid code).

A free plugin model would be an ajax thumbnail tool like:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-thumbnail-rebuild/

Hi Alex,

I sugest you use http://wp-cli.org and look at existing code like the wp user import-csv, wp post create or wp media regenerate for inspiration.

You can create an custom command that runs your code from the commandline. No time-outs :)

Saves time building an interface.

Ciao,

Jaime

Subject: [wp-hackers] Wordpress Query Variables - Controlling Which Pages
	Allow Them
Message-ID: <1398363307743-43906.post@n5.nabble.com>

Is there a way to control which pages, or rewritten urls, are allowed a
specific query variable?  For example, if I add 30 query variables in a
plugin, all of those query variables are allowed to be loaded on any given
page or permalink.  How can I prevent this, so only the permalinks specified
are allowed to use a query string? 

I looked into permastructs but that looks like its limited for use with
taxonomies.  Maybe some kinda of canonical rule for query vars?   Does
something already exist for this that I am not aware of?

Message-ID: <2cc59ba36aed608b9f4e134081f3da82@tv-productions.org>

Hi list,

I am a plugin developer and I use an about page for my plugin to show 
users the latest changes. It is an about page like the WordPress about 
page (wp-admin/about.php).
I redirect users after installation, activation and update to this about 
page.

Then a more technical part of it: imagine that you update some plugin 
from which at least two plugins use an about page (and use the same 
technique to redirect to that page), the user will see probably only the 
about page of first plugin.

I am wondering if it is right to have an about page like this. I mean, 
should only WordPress have an about page and plugins not? Are there any 
alternatives? What about the redirect after (bulk) plugin update?

I would like to hear your opinion on this and/or the way you inform 
users about the changes in a new release.

Best regards,

Ties

You should not do this as it assumes your plugin is the only one running or being upgraded, but of course it's not. In fact, hijacking the admin is explicitly prohibited in plugin guidelines #11:

"Plugins should not hijack the blog admin. It is fine to include an Upgrade prompt on the plugin admin page, but not throughout the blog. It is acceptable to embed a widget on the dashboard but this should be the same size as others and be dismissable. It's fine to put an error message at the top of the admin for special cases, but it should be linked to a way to fix the error and it should be infrequent. Any form of "nagging" is absolutely prohibited."
http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/

If you really want to notify users of changes after an upgrade, use an admin notice to link to your about page (as these can stack up for multiple plugins).

But consider that this may just be annoying (see nagging provision above) and not very beneficial to anyone in the end. If they care, they know where to find your plugin -- unless there are breaking changes, user required actions, or something *really* important -- what's so special about your plugin that it needs this, when thousands of plugins get by without it?

Also, make sure the user can cancel that notice (e.g. make it dismissible) if they don't care to read your page.

Both bbPress and BuddyPress do this, as does WooCommerce (and probably many others). I think it can be beneficial, though it can also be annoying (as Nick pointed out). If none of the developers of those plugins come along and answer your question, you could check their source code to see if they are getting around this problem with multiple updates somehow.

Seems the obvious answer here is to detected is multiple plugins
activations are occurring via the bulk action. With BuddyPress for example
as J.D. pointed out it does redirect. But that is only if it is singularly
activated by clicking the activate link on the plugin row. If you activate
BuddyPress via the bulk actions submit it does not redirect.

On activation or upgrade? Those are entirely different scenarios -- e.g. one time vs. all the time. Sounds like BuddyPress only does so on direct *activation* (not bulk) which is not intrusive as I'm in the flow if activating that specific plugin for the first time.

Those are also all very large plugins that require significant initial setup -- so I can see the use case there. Few plugins need that kind of interaction on *every upgrade* (except maybe in the case of a major version bump with breaking changes, but a dismissible notice is still the better pattern there, if you must do anything).

The only place I could even see a potential argument for would be a direct upgrade (just that plugin) but even that is a bit overkill (and misses a lot of upgrade cases - ftp upgrades, bulk upgrades, external upgrade managers like ManageWP, etc.

If I want to see the changes, that's what the changelog option on the upgrade screen (and repo) is for.

A tab or submenu could give access to that post upgrade (e.g. the same about page he has now).

A notice is a bit more intrusive, but dismissible and can handle all cases (on next admin visit).

A redirect on upgrade is very intrusive, and misses a good deal of cases.

Hello.

Anybody has a hint on using the author's username in the rewrite for a

Thank you all for your opinion! I think I move to a notice, as you 
suggested. This is also easier than redirecting all those cases.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_localize_script - when should the JS var be
	available
Message-ID: <270AFB08-AAA3-4F8E-92D7-5A20940BDFC6@codesymphony.co>

When making data available to a script using wp_locaize_script() is it safe to assume that the JS variable holding the data will be available when the file JS file is parsed/executed? Or is it only guaranteed to be available by the time the DOM is ready? 

I ask because I noticed an "undefined variable ?settings?? notice in the browser console. This (poorly named) variable is being added by a plugin using wp_localize_script(). When I check the page source, I see that the data is being output, but not until *after* the script tags in the head. I think WP usually outputs the data immediately above the script tag for the file that uses it, but in this case it isn?t (a caching plugin is being used which is probably the cause). I notice that none of the other scripts seem to be giving undefined variable notices though, likely because they don?t attempt to use their localized data until the DOM is ready . So I?m wondering who is doing it wrong. Is it wrong for the plugin to assume that the variable will be there when the file is parsed, or should the caching plugin (or whatever the culprit) not be moving the localized data below the scripts?

https://hackerone.com/ is now open for all projects, so it's a great way 
to solicit security audits for your plugins/themes, and offer 
researchers bounties for responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities.

I've been using it for the past week and love it. The signal/noise ratio 
can be pretty high, but if you work on communicating your scope clearly 
that can help a lot.

Both bbPress and BuddyPress indeed have an 'about' page, and are activated after activation and update though there are no checks to see if 'another' plugin is about to do the same.

@tw2113 gave this a try last month https://twitter.com/tw2113/status/444602541482196992

Any localized script has the data output directly preceding the related script element, via the print_extra_script() method in WP_Scripts (https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/class.wp-scripts.php#L127).
