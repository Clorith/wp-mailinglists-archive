are you talking about conversion/encoding from FLAC to various  
formats, or do you need something else?
this one is pretty easy to accomplish by bash scripting or even php/ 
CLI scripting, if you are in a linux realm.
can you explain a little more what your needs are and what server  
tecnology you're oriented to use?

bests,
Paolo

It will be Linux. I already have a shell script, written in PHP/CLI  to do
this, but wondered if someone had already done the work for me.
My needs are to allow an admin user to upload a flac file then have this
file's tags scanned and it added to the database, then have a script,
probably using cron, convert the FLAC to numerous other formats.

or maybe you can just plug it after the upload, let the admin choose  
formats (if they aren't fixed) and do the conversion on the fly :)
I was wondering about this as an extension for another plugin I've  
made, say, to allow an mp3 to be tagged with text and permalink of  
the real page.  This is the hard way; a conversion script (either  
bash or php) would be easier to write than a plugin, I think.

Sorry, I have not really much time and connection in these days (I'm  
moving myself in another City) but I'll try to have a look and  
hopefully write some code soon.

Heya,

Quick question: I was reading up on the <!--nextpage--> feature, but  
saw in the codex that the backend function is being deprecated.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/link_pages

Is the tag itself going the way of the dodo, or just the backend  
functions?

Thanks. :)

Stephane

The link_pages() template tag has been replaced by the 
wp_link_pages()[1] template tag, which does the same job, and implements 
the <!--nextpage--> feature.

Hi!!!
Do you remember me!!?? :)

The plugin you told me is terrific but i need to make some changes to
it, do you know how can i contact the authors!?!??

The main trouble is that I need the plugin don't put the "Table of
Content" over the whole content, I need that it makes his job similar to
the way that mediawiki does, first the introductory paragraph and then
the Table of Content ;)

well, I will really appreciate your help and by the way, I made a plugin
for the TinyMCE editor, the one WYSIWYG that uses WordPress that lets
you have a shortcut to add double brackets to a selected word when
typing, if you want it just say it ;)

See ya,
B.

Well, not terribly helpful, as that shows the tables, but does not 
describe purpose, relationships or anything else!
I have not found anything in the codex that properly pulls this together 
, but these links are easily found by searching
http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description
and Ryan has described the new taxonomy schema quite well here
http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Version_2.3:New_Taxonomy

hope that helps
Chris

The Database Schema can be found by searching the WordPress source code. It
is contained within: wp-includes\wp-db.php and wp-admin\includes\schema.php,
it's quite simple really. Especially when the file you were looking for was
named exactly as you named it, "schema"...

@Bull3t
Well, on my install of wordpress 2.2 wp-admin\includes\schema.php does 
not exist, and the source of wp-includes\wp-db.php only lists the 
tables, not the schema!
Perhaps we mean different things by "schema". I would like to see a 
complete map of the tables, the relationships between the (key) fields, 
and a description of ach table purpose, how it is used, and same for 
each field.
Now that would aid understanding when hacking wordpress or writing a plugin!
So, does anyone have a link to an up-to-date article that covers all this?
Chris

If you're writing a plugin, you really, really, really should try to
avoid messing with the WordPress-stored data by hand (which is the only
reason you would need to know about the schema). Use the WordPress
APIs[1][2] to alter and read what you need about users, posts,
tags/categories, links, comments and options. This will make your code
more robust if the schema changes in the future.

If you absolutely must query the tables directly, the easiest way to
see how they work is to either view the schema file[3], or install
Apache, PHP, MySQL and WordPress on your local box, and look at the
database WordPress creates. The MySQL manual[4] should have all the
information you need about SQL syntax and the DESCRIBE TABLE
and SELECT commands. No, it won't describe the relationships for you --
you have to match the foreign keys up yourself, since the FK constraints
are not explicitly set in this schema (which means you also won't be
able to "get a picture" -- the connections will be missing). It's not
hard to figure out what the fields do, and which fields are foreign key
references, just from the field names. It's what developers like to call
"self-documenting". ;)

Again, it's not too hard -- however, it does provide a bar, whether
intentional or not. You have to grok RDBMSs and English at at least a
minimal level, and have a little bit of developer's intuition, before
you can start playing with these matches.



As to your other question: you cannot get the schema for a site's
database (e.g., "craigslist"), unless you have access to the back-end
SQL servers or a person with inside knowledge -- that information is
private. In any case, unless you're running software *on* that site,
the scheme it uses is completely irrelevant. There is no such thing as
a "site schema".

With a friend are studying different databases schema like mediawiki,
pligg and others and we wanted to print the one from wordpress too, so
there is another reason ;) and that's why I asked if there where a
generated picture from the database, as the one I found from the
mediawiki for instance ;) [b1]

I know it may be hard to find out the db schema of a site but there
should be somewhere in the net info about cragislist and the way the
organize their info, and the way the have structured their site, as you
said I have to improve my English!

See ya!!

Hi again,

I need your opinion, I made the plugin for the TinyMCE (the one I send
but the list removed from the message, when get connected I'm going to
upload it), but I don't know how to make a plugin for wordpress with the
plugin of tinyMCE inside ;)

Message-ID: <2066f5bd0711050707ob193cb8nc935a8a40d565792@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

I don't know if this is the appropriate place to ask about this problem, but
I got information about this lists after googling around reCaptcha on wp. I
found 2 spam ask me to be approved on one of wp site which I managed:

Author : admin (IP: 221.217.203.6 , 221.217.203.6)
> E-mail : admin@sohu.com
> URL    :
> Whois  : http://ws.arin.net/cgi-bin/whois.pl?queryinput=221.217.203.6
> Comment:
> For a quick summary see our hotels in Beijing,.....


I've implemented reCaptcha for comment on the blog but this spam still could
access the comment page, is there any known bot around which can break
reCaptcha? or this just break reCaptcha implementation on wp? or I have some
misconfiguration to fully protect the blog against the bot?

I too would be curious to hear the answer to this one.

Easy there, the joke wasn't on you.  The person who responded was offering a
humorous response to your request for "an up-to-date article that covers all
this", and the humor didn't translate.

The comment might simply be the result of an actual human spammer and
reCaptcha wouldn't be able to help against him/her unless they're blind.
I would suggest you look into Spam Karma 2 and Akismet combined, although I
still get 2-5 a week on a volume of 500+/day.

Just FYI, reCAPTCHA is one of several CAPTCHA implementations that at 
least has an audio CAPTCHA built-in:

http://recaptcha.net/whyrecaptcha.html

Blind users often struggle with audio CAPTCHAs, but they are better than 
nothing. The CAPTCHA Project's unqualified claim that this makes 
reCAPTCHA "accessible" is bogus however, since their implementation 
obviously still locks out the deafblind without exception.

At the risk of angering the Spam Gods, my antispam measures are  
pretty bulletproof. :)  Check this out...

That being said, it would be really cool if somebody figured out how  
to make ReCaptcha a plugin for Spam Karma.  :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] "Submit for review" checks wrong role
Message-ID: <e1202cb10711051221o36bbc769j8fd031f14c108b82@mail.gmail.com>

[appologies if this is a double post, having problems with list]

Hey guys, this seems like a bug to me, but might be by design:

It has to do with the new post submission feature where users who
can't publish their own posts can submit them for review rather than
just saving them as draft and informing the site admin that they want
it published.

in /wp-admin/edit-form-advanced.php on line 172 the logic checks to
see if a user has the publish_posts capability/role and if they do
not, it labels the "publish" button as "submit for review" instead.

 172  <?php if ( current_user_can('publish_posts') ) : ?>
 173      <input name="publish" type="submit" id="publish"
tabindex="5" accesskey="p" value="<?php _e('Publish') ?>" />
 174  <?php else : ?>
 175      <input name="publish" type="submit" id="publish"
tabindex="5" accesskey="p" value="<?php _e('Submit for Review') ?>" />
 176  <?php endif; ?>

This is linked with line 69 of /wp-admin/includes/post.php which
processes the post status and sets it to pending based on user
capabilities:

 69          if ('publish' == $_POST['post_status'] &&
!current_user_can( 'edit_published_posts' ))
 70              $_POST['post_status'] = 'pending';
 71      }

As far as I can tell, there is no reason why the processing check
should use the "edit_published_posts" role rather than the
publish_posts role, especially considering that the publish_posts role
was the one originally used to determine the text on the button. In
the case of our site, or any where authors need help initially editing
their posts but are trusted to make changes once the post is approved
(and thus have edit_published_posts but not publish_posts), this
results in people seeing the text "submit for review" but actually
having their posts published to the blog, which of course can have
terrible results.

Any reason why this is this way? Seems like it should be fast-tracked
into core and anyone using this functionality should probably patch it
for themselves.

NOTE: the edit_published_posts role I think is only available to
authors through the role manager plugin, so if you aren't using it you
probably aren't at risk, i think that's why this wasn't noticed when
it was first implemented, for most installs publish_posts and
edit_published_posts are available/unnavailable to the same group
categories).

Thanks,

"Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ')' in 
/home/stride/public_html/wp-config.php on line 12"

Yeah, I would say that prevents the spam from getting through!

No, for the last time, there doesn't have to be a place on the net for
CraigsList's schema any more than there is one for eBay or Amazon or
Microsoft.

It's a PRIVATE site, PRIVATELY developed on PRIVATELY owned code - meaning
we don't have it :)

MediaWiki is an OPEN SOURCE project with OPEN SOURCE code and schema.

Yes, I agree. I also suspected it was done by human spammer, as I know
reCaptcha is powerfull since it use "unsolved words by OCR which is
solved only by human to be it's known words" so quite difficult to
make bot read the challange words.

I just curious if there's some bot which has this capability or some
other way to break the reCaptcha, or some mis-implementation of
reCaptch on wp.

I don't think other spam guard is as powerfull as reCaptcha, since
they use static algorithm which can be tested and read by bot, or I
got mis-understanding on this?

Captcha, besides being utterly annoying in my opinion to nice users,
only deal with comments, which are a minority compared to trackback
spam.
And captcha are nothing near bot safe: http://sam.zoy.org/pwntcha/

Actually, I believe it does. It first has to load the WP-Cache plugin,
and before it can do that, it has to check from the DB what plugins are
actually loaded.

On second thoughts, maybe the list of active plugins is stored in the
disk cache ? I'm actually not that sure now.

It doesn't connect to the db, wp-settings.php calls the advanced cache 
before even including all the wp-includes stuffs. That's why WP-Cache is 
so cumbersome to hack and unflexible: loading a cached page is done 
without having access to any of your regular WP functions.

I agree, it looks like it's a bug. I'd suggest submitting a patch to 
trac, it'll probably get implemented pretty quickly.

Cheers - Callum.

Hi,

I'm a developer on reCAPTCHA. Please see our FAQ entry on this:

HELP, I'm still seeing comment spam

There are two common issues that make reCAPTCHA appear to be broken,
but are actually not problems.

    * Moderation emails: reCAPTCHA marks comments as spam, so if you
get moderation emails when spam comments are sent, you will get
moderation emails for all spam comments with reCAPTCHA. We highly
recommend turning off moderation emails with reCAPTCHA.
    * Trackbacks and Pingbacks: reCAPTCHA can't do anything about
pingbacks and trackbacks. You can disable pingbacks and trackbacks in
Options | Discussion | Allow link notifications from other Weblogs
(pingbacks and trackbacks).

We're working on a way to make these issues easier to understand for
users, as it's a cause for confusion. We'd appreciate suggestions from
wp-hackers on this matter.

Wasn't the edit_published_posts capability the one to allow or
disallow authors to edit their published posts?  I.e. when the
submitted post is reviewed and published, can the author make
changes or do the changes need to go through review again.

Best regards,

Subject: [wp-hackers] apply_filters, merge_filters and reset()
Message-ID: <20071107145637.089040c6@remstate.com>

Hey folks,

  If I could direct some eyes to the (2.3.1) apply_filters function in
wp-includes/plugin.php, the code doesn't look right. There's a do/while
construct on (next($wp_filters[$tag]) !== false). The $wp_filters[$tag]
array is *not* explicitly reset within the function, although resetting
that array is done as a side effect of merge_filters. In all the other
functions in this file using the same (next(...)) construct,
merge_filters is called unconditionally. In apply_filters,
merge_filters is called only if the $merged_filters global is unset.

This *seems* like it's a bug (normally, array counters are reset before
attempting to iterate; calling apply_filters twice with the same
tag would seem to do nothing on the second call), but I'm unsure if the
code is like this for a specific reason.

I'm hesitant to file a bug directly on this issue, because I'm patching
that function to use a foreach instead*. The foreach will change the
semantics, because the array will always be iterated over its full
length. I want to make sure I'm not changing the *intended* semantics,
though.

I think there might be a good reason to not use foreach in that function 
because of the inter references and possible changes. If you add a tag 
while iterating, you will break the array reference and it would need to 
be reset anyway. It is quite possible that the while construct was used 
for the very reason that you should not use foreach when the array you 
are iterating over can change. PHP does not forbade you from doing so, 
but it is generally not good in the sense that it might work in one 
environment and then bomb on another.

And yes, if you read the reports, the do_action and companion should 
have checked for the tag in merged_filters before calling merge_filters 
function.

Hoping this won't be inappropriate chatter. Sorry if so, just let me  
know.

I was wondering if anyone on the list would be interested in having a  
WordPressCamp in Montreal (Canada)?

I can get the ball rolling and see if I can score a location, etc.
Nothing formal, just a bunch of WP hackers meeting up, having some WP  
fun, and who know, maybe even crank up some code if anyone's in need.
BarCamp style (http://barcamp.org). I just went to BarCampMontreal3  
and FaceBookCampMontreal, and it was really fun (though maybe not  
entirely useful).

Let me know, here if appropriate, or off-list.

Cheers,

For the record, these concern trunk/2.4, not 2.3.1. The discussion
about separating filters/actions is interesting, but there still
may need to be a simpler bugfix applied to 2.3.2 (e.g., always call
merge_filters, or at least always reset the array). I'll have to re-run
perf on a 2.4 beta/RC anyway. ;)

<snip>

I assume you mean "a filter/action adds/removes hooks" when you say
"add a tag while iterating". That's a valid point; I'd need to test and
make sure that it still works (I know I have some plugin code somewhere
that does just this by hooking a high level and de-hooking a
lower-level callback). I'm not entirely confident that each() really
behaves any more consistently than foreach in that scenario, though.

Which would indicate that they're all buggy, since they rely on the
reset side-effect of merged_filters to get the array pointer back to
the start, and nothing else (as far as I can see) resets that array.

You should very well, make the bug report then for 2.3.2. It would at 
least fix some issues with actions that may have been edge cases.

There is no need to test, but you can do so anyway, it has been a while 
and this is one of the little known and documented issues. I've already 
ran a few (including switching over to foreach) while testing the issue 
with <code>next($wp_filter[$tag]) !== false</code>.

I think the problem is that foreach doesn't expect for the array to be 
updated inside of its loop. It only does the reset before it starts. The 
second issue would be that foreach acts upon a copy of the original 
array. Appending values to the original array will not update the array 
referenced in the foreach construct.

Sigh. I guess I'll do that. ;)

each()/next() does not solve this problem by itself, and there are no
separate reset()s in the code, so foreach is the same as the current
code in this respect.

That's the killer, but only if the new item is, as you say, appended
(and that's an assumption I'm willing to make, even though I haven't
read all the code). However, then there's an issue in that calling
add_filter or add_action will void the merge, so theoretically the
set-check and (conditional) call to merge_filters needs to be done on
*every iteration* -- which would cause the array pointer to be reset in
the middle, and would in turn lead to infinite loopage.

That said, voiding the merge value doesn't make sense if you just tack
a new function onto the target -- it only makes sense to do a void if
the hooks vs. the 'all' tag is updated, at which point you need to need
to void the merged status on all the other tags at once. I don't think
the code works if you add a new "all" hook in the middle (one, because
merge_tags isn't checked/called every loop, two, because the merged
status isn't removed on the individual tags). In fact, I don't think
it will work if you call do_action("foo"), add_hook("all"),
do_action("foo").

This whole section of code is really unpleasant. :(

I can't duplicate this on any of my servers, though it would help if the
post was a bit more specific as to just WTH happened...

AFAIK the include and require statements in the Super Cache code are all
pretty clean, no problems there. And the blog post mentions exploits of the
"i" and "s" parameters - I have no idea what that's actually supposed to
mean, but assuming that's GET variables then that would be a PHP
vulnerability present in the original WP code, and not the Super Cache
plugin....

Just my two cents.. No need for unwarranted panic, esp. not from some half
thought-out twitter posts.

Subject: [wp-hackers] gengo and wordpress 2.3+
Message-ID: <761FF0C6-61DA-4E88-98C3-FF8DBFE21FAE@pixline.net>

Hi all,
I just want to inform you that I'm working on the Gengo plugin port  
to WordPress 2.3 schema, and I'm looking for testers and other coders  
to make this great plugin work on recent versions. That's the beauty  
in open source: someone may fix what you can't deal :-)

I need especially some help on mysql-related issues with the new  
taxonomy schema, I'm not really good at mysql as I supposed to be...

The status of this porting is actually: Gengo can work with WordPress  
2.2.3 (live test website at http://shababfm.org ), and can install  
(and make something) on WPMU 1.2.5a ; I'm looking to make it 2.3+  
compatible, and I think that only the category/mysql part is missing  
to achieve this, as well as a full debug.

You can find more about this coding process (as well as my actual  
diff patch) at:

<http://jamietalbot.com/wp-hacks/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=154>

If you have time to help me/us, it will be really appreciated.
Thank you all!

Oh yeah, when I say "tag," I'm referring to $tag variable in each of the 
Plugin API functions and not to the taxonomy API.

No, the while loop is handling the actual array and not a copy, 
therefore it will be updated if a new hook is added or removed. The 
foreach will not, which might be a good thing. There would need to be a 
reset before the while loop yes. Hey, if you check the bug for 
_build_hook_unique_id() (I can never remember the exact name). You'll 
find additional information that will be helpful.

If someone adds a new tag, then it should only be iterated over on the 
next call. It should not be expected to be able to call a new hook from 
within an added tag without calling that tag after the iteration is 
called first. As far as I see it, it isn't a bug in a bug in WordPress 
but in the plugin.

The situation I'm talking about is if a called hook adds or removes a 
hook within the same tag. This is a rare case, but one I've noticed 
while I've done my unit tests (however, the bug fix works for any sort 
of adding or removing of hooks no matter if it is the same tag or not).

Even through it is an edge case, it still might happen and if the 
expected result is not given (all tags are executed), then it would be a 
bug in WordPress, instead of the other way around.

Don't fix what isn't broken. The while loop is not what is broken and 
while I would like to see it a foreach, it is not a good idea.

Well, the all tag is bugged anyway and you shouldn't use it. You will 
lose priority information because of the array_merge function. The 
solution in 2.4 is to just call the all tag, if it exists, before 
iterating over all of the rest of the items in the current tag. Now that 
you mentioned it, there are several problems associated with 
merge_filters and it is probably for the best that it is gone.

Cool! Let me contact a few people, and I'll get post back soon.

PS: I've also gotten feedback through other channels and ppl seem  
interested (users, designers, coders, etc).
PPS: When I said Montreal, it's not an exclusive thing. All would be  
welcomed if you're into driving.

Two separate issues have been confused and slurred together here -- let
me try and separate them back out.


1) In all cases, the array being worked on needs to be completely
iterated over. Using next() requires that reset() be called prior to
the start of iteration. Reset() is not always being called on
$wp_filter[$tag] in apply_filters. This seems wrong. This is my
original issue/question. My proposed solution to *this* problem is to
add an appropriate reset() call to each of apply_filters, do_action, and
do_action_ref_array.



The reason I came across the above, but NOT actually part of the
question, is the fact that I would like to use foreach as a
replacement. Since we have discussed it thus far, though, these are my
thoughts on this completely separate suggestion:


2) Foreach iterates over a copy of the array, while next et. al. iterate
over the array directly. Updates to the array inside the loop are only
reflected when working directly on the array in question. I understand
and do not contest this.

3) Using foreach over next would be beneficial for a number of reasons
(automatic, full iteration; more readable; faster).

4) The problem you described re. adding callbacks to the
currently-running filter/action is completely moot, because the current
implementation *already uses* foreach on the inner loop (where the
installed callbacks exist). The while(next(...)) construct is used to
iterate over priority levels only -- all that needs to be done to
support foreach for priority levels is to define indexes 1-10 in the
$wp_filters["$tag"] array when the $tag index is first created.

Removing a callback on a hook, while in a callback being invoked by the
same hook, is not a guaranteed operation -- unless the callback being
removed is in a later-run priority level. Adding a callback on a hook,
while in a callback being invoked by the same hook, is pointless --
unless (again) the callback is being added to a later-run priority
level (otherwise, you may as well just call the other callback
directly). The semantics of the current implementation do not allow
either of these scenarios, which is as it should be.

The foreach loop for handling each priority level is nested, and so the
updated data in later priority levels can be accessed directly. Here is
an example re-implementation using a foreach on the outer loop:

$wp_filter["foo"][1][] = "This is the first item in runlevel 1.\n";
$wp_filter["foo"][2][] = "This is the first item in runlevel 2.\n";


foreach($wp_filter["foo"] as $key => $value) {
    foreach($wp_filter["foo"][$key] as $item) {
        echo $item;
        $wp_filter["foo"][2][] = "This item was added to runlevel 2 in
both runlevels 1 and 2, but only the one from level 1 will show
up.\n";
        $wp_filters["foo"][3][] = "Won't work, but if we had
pre-defined this index before the outer loop, it would be fine.\n";
    }
}

[Output]
This is the first item in runlevel 1.
This is the first item in runlevel 2.
This item was added to runlevel 2 in both runlevels 1 and 2, but only
the one from level 1 will show up.
[/Output]

I'd use this:

	get_currentuserinfo();

You're thinking too hard. ;)

global $current_user;
$current_user->user_email;

Make sure you're doing it after authentication has taken place, though.

I recently used just this and it is as easy as Andy and Travis suggest
-- bummer is knowing what to look for, but I found similar code in
another plugin (don't recall which one now).

get_currentuserinfo is only needed if you're doing stuff really,
really early. When wp() is called, get_currentuserinfo is called
automatically; any filters/actions that are used after the wp action
just need to use the globals (it's been that way since 2.0). There are
only a tiny handful of actions that you can hook that *won't* have the
global data already set (most notably, plugins_loaded and init).

Although particularly unlikely to change...
Using functions (local variables) is a usually great way to reduce
possibly maintenance.

Hey thanks to all... I got it working like a charm. Another question, if I
may:

Does anyone know how to detect what template the current page uses?

get_currentuserinfo is only needed if you're doing stuff really,
really early. When wp() is called, get_currentuserinfo is called
automatically; any filters/actions that are used after the wp action
just need to use the globals (it's been that way since 2.0). There are
only a tiny handful of actions that you can hook that *won't* have the
global data already set (most notably, plugins_loaded and init).

I don't know if there's a function to detect the template file in use,
but there are functions to check for the conditions that cause a
template file to be used:

is_home()
is_paged()
is_single()
is_page()
is_category()
is_month()
is_year()
is_day()

etc.

Look at wp-includes/theme.php (or wp-includes/functions.php on older WP)
for these functions:

    get_stylesheet()
    get_stylesheet_directory()
    get_stylesheet_uri()

    get_template()
    get_template_directory()
    get_template_directory_uri()

The function is_page_template($template = '') is currently in trunk,
it'll be in 2.4.

Hi - This seems like a question that must have been asked before but I
couldn't find anything in my searches.

Is there a way to enable pagination inside a WordPress page like you can
with posts using something like the posts_nav_link function?

Thanks,
Damian

Just use <!--nextpage--> as you would on a post.

I could be wrong but that doesn't seem to be working for me.

I've got this in my index.php template file:
<?php posts_nav_link(' &#8212; ', __('&laquo; Previous Page'), __('Next Page
&raquo;')); ?>

And this in my page in the editor:
<!--nextpage-->

But I'm getting nothing.

You need wp_link_pages() at the end of the post or page loop.

Hmm, I believe my usage of foreach was to use the $value of the first 
foreach (since it is the array) instead of doing your method. I was able 
to confirm that, at the very least, it doesn't break anything on the 
trunk. I would rather use foreach than while since it looks cleaner.

If you want to take care of 2.3.x, I'll submit a patch for 2.4. There 
are some other areas I want to clean up in the trunk.

You should consider using In Series instead of paginating your
posts[1][2]. <http://remstate.com/projects/in-series/>.

I think we used to do a foreach.  A switch was made to do-while-next
because it was supposedly faster.  I don't really care what the loop
looks like as long it is as fast as can be.  apply_filters is called
hundreds of times.  Any changes need to be profiled.

Yeah, I know -- that's how I got started down this whole path;
apply_filters was taking up a huge proportion of execution time. My
profiler shows reset(), each(), next() and ilk to be really darn slow;
switching to foreach cut the time spent in that function (directly)
about in half.

That said, I run Gentoo, and it could be that the tweak compiler flags I
used to build PHP cause different costs to be associated with these
constructs vs. PHP built with a different compiler/flags. So, I suggest
that you not take my word for it, and profile reset()/each() vs. foreach
yourself.

[Apologies to those on the wp-trac list.. It would be nice if that list was read-only, i should've read the email address closer]

Hi List,
I just thought i'd float this here again and see what peoples thoughts are on this.

In short:
This ticket is designed to allow the options.php page be used to delete items, as well as viewing serialized data, And it groups options together into their own section if they share a common prefix.
The ticket also includes the patch in plugin form, so if you would like to take a look, you can simply install the plugin instead of applying the diff.

I havn't added the autoload param. yet, i'm after UI feedback and unsure of how to present it.

Heres the ticket:

Well, I think cleaning the code up would cut some of the branching, 
which would speed things up. Some things I've noted.

1. Is the key sorting of $wp_filter[$tag] really necessary? I don't 
think so. Removing the whole merged_filters variable could speed up a 
portion where apply_filters is first called. I would make a guess and 
say that most filters are only called once. Which would boost the speed. 
You would cut the branch (+1), cut out three function calls (reset, 
uksort, and strnatcasecmp), and a few assignments.

2. Moving the "Do 'all' actions first into its own function will slow 
things down, since it is an additional user function call, but having 
the code in one place would make the code cleaner and any changes 
easier. The cost would be minimal. You could even keep the branch for 
checking and put all the rest of the code in a function. That way, the 
cost for calling the function is only applied if the 'all' hook exists.

3. @$wp_current_filters[] = $tag is really damn slow. Not the 
assignment, the '@' character. I don't know what warning or notice it is 
supposed to suppress, but it would be quicker it is was taken out. If 
you need to, just check that $wp_current_filter is an array and make it 
one if it isn't.

4. Have $wp_current_filter[] = $tag; after the check to see if the tag 
exists. As well as calling the 'all' hook. There is no point of 
executing everything if it doesn't exist. Although, calling the all hook 
might be to say that it could test to make sure that the tag has any 
values, which could be used for debugging, but whether the hook exists 
or not is not directly passed to the all hook, so the hook would have to 
test for it on their its own. (using has_filter).

5. When is $args ever going to be empty? I know, when the all tag 
doesn't exist. However, both need it, so it can be placed outside the 
all hook branch, so that there wouldn't need to be a check for it, which 
would be executed for about 99.99% of users. Moving it from the branch, 
would save some time spent executing 'empty' function. (for 
apply_filters()).

Getting rid of it would be nice.  I'm digging through svn history
trying to figure out what the sort was added for.

Leaving the check and pushing the rest into a function seems
reasonable.  We don't need to optimize the all case too much since it
will only be used in debugging.

Losing the @ is good.  Actually, now that we pass the action/filter
tag to the 'all' hooks, there is less reason to keep track of the
current filter at all.

Okay

The idea was to call func_get_args only once and make sure we never
call it if neither 'all' nor the current tag have hooks set.  I'm fine
with calling it once for 'all', if set, and once for the current tag
so that we can skip the empty check.  The extra overhead in the 'all'
case is no big deal since 'all' is a debugging scenario.  We should
optimize for the non-'all' case.

How about you patch it so that it is fast as can be on your setup, and
then I'll profile  the patch on my assortment of servers?

I've been doing some profiling against 2.4 and fixing up some
particularly slow places.  2.4 is quite a bit faster for me now.  If
you cachegrinders see anything that needs sped up, let us know and we
can start tweaking.

That's a fun hack

What would really be worth it would be allowing editing of serialized
data, just like you can edit non serialized stuff. Could be a possible
UI nightmare, depending on the approach you would take to do it,
though.

I'd also suggest some layout rework, to make things more simple &
usable (for instance on wide screen the checkboxes are way too far on
the left, the centering of option names makes no sense and is ugly --
yes, I know, the original page was like this, etc...)

For what my opinion on this is worth, I'd be in favor of making this
core, since it cannot do more harm than the regular options.php page,
which is "hidden" anyway.

Would be fun, It would be possible if it was a serialized array.. might even be possible if its a serialized object.. But i'm thinking theres too many possibilities where that could go wrong, I've wanted to remove a single entry from serialized arrays without removing the entire value a fewtimes now i think of it.. So i may well look into that (Dont hold your breathe though :P)

Yeah, I was thinking the same honestly, I was trying to keep to the same UI layout for the proposal, just to save the extra layout work.
(Was also going to do Select All/Deselect All instead of Invert, But time ran out)

My thoughts exactly, it doesnt do more harm, yet allows users much more control over the options.

I'll be happy to hear others comments on layout or functionality, Heck, someone else can even write it up if they want :)
I'll take everything on board and write some more stuff up later next week.

I can see a UI based on a tree not dissimilar to the output of print_r 
() or var_dump() to be feasible.

I think that the most usable & clean thing would be something like a
print_r with in-place editing[1] of each item to avoid cluttering
space with an input/textarea mayhem

Subject: [wp-hackers] Scope for functions in a theme
Message-ID: <000801c823c2$488236e0$d986a4a0$@com>

Hello,

I'm working on a theme in which I would like to generate some XML using
get_posts:

<?php foreach(get_posts('category=3') as $post) : ?>
	<state id="point">
		<name><?php the_title() ?></name>
	</state>
<?php endforeach; ?>

The file calling get_posts returns the error "Fatal error: Call to undefined
function: get_posts()". Can anyone help me understand why I can call that
function in certain files in my theme directory but not others?



Thanks,

You can only call WordPress functions in files which are included by
WordPress, so that's any of the template files (index.php,
archive.php, page.php, search.php etc.) and functions.php. If you want
to call WordPress functions in any other file then they must be
included by one of those template files or functions.php.

Hey everybody!

I'm using WPMU and want to allow users to get a custom feed that 
combines all the authors they like into a single channel.  For 
consistency's sake, I'd like to be able to query the info directly from 
the dB and then port the output through WP's existing feed functions.  
I'm having difficulty figuring out where to start with the second, feed 
portion of the process.  Could you briefly outline the feed process in 
WP, so I can at least get a sense of where I'd want to hook my functions?

Thanks very much!

1. Request comes in to /wp-feed.php
2. do_feed (/wp-includes/functions.php) determines the type of feed to
output
3. do_feed invokes do_action("do_feed_$type")
4. The default feed generators are hooked into these actions
(/wp-includes/default-filters.php)

So, you probably want to remove_hook the default feed generators, and
hook in the new ones you're writing in their place.

Tom,

No idea if this is any help, but you can add certain parameters to the
feed URL such as cat and author. So for example,
www.yourblog.com/feed?cat=6 would give you the feed for category 6.
www.yourblog.com/feed?author=2 would give you the feed for posts by
author with the ID of 2. You can add multiple values too, so
www.yourblog.com/feed?author=2,5,6,10 would give you the feed of posts
by authors 2, 5, 6, and 10. Might come in handy for you and possibly
save you diving into the code.

Regards,
John

Message-ID: <8f93a7390711102116t35286c16p1feaad954c26fb74@mail.gmail.com>

By stupidly screwing around with the Role Manager plugins over the years
(renaming roles, creating custom roles for others, etc.), I've slowly broken
one of my sites and finally sealed the deal a few minutes ago by completely
locking myself out of my blog when I tried to rename my current role.

Is there any way (or plugin) to reset all roles and capabilities to as if I
had just installed WordPress? I can deal with everyone getting the
Administrator role or whatever as I can move them back to editors.

I'm thinking I do a fresh install of WordPress can copy over the row in the
options table that lists the roles and then copying over the usermeta row
for capabilities, but I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to roles and caps,
so suggestions welcome.

You could probably just make a fresh install of WordPress elsewhere, then
copy over the row wp_user_roles in the table wp_options, and copy over the
rows wp_capabilities and wp_user_level for each user (make new users on the
fresh install with each role, and then figure out who has what role on your
site).

It looks like that's all that needs to be done to reset the roles...

Perhaps Re Setting Your Pass. Or Try Removing The PlugIn From Its
Directory. He All Else Fails Get The Tables From Your Database That
Involve Post And What Not. Then Start A New WordPress And Load Those
Tables To Your New Database. That Should Do It.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Looking for plugin development guidance
Message-ID: <00a201c82465$b6b1edb0$2415c910$@com>

I am working on a WP plugin to support a youth Swim Team.  I have quite a
bit of the support infrastructure in place from the admin side (registering
swimmers, defining age groups, volunteer roles, etc.) and am at the point
where I want to expose functionality to the target users.

 

I am looking for suggestions on the best or recommended way to expose new
functionality to the user facing part of the web site.  My initial thought
is to automatically generate pages when the plugin is installed for the
various things I would need (swim meet schedule, results, roster, etc.) to
expose to the typical user.

 

Is there a better or recommended way to do something like this?

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

 

PS:  Any pros or cons on hosting the plugin at SourceForge vs.
wp-plugins.org?

Well, I'm not sure if you add numbers and it will execute in that order, 
or if I've been adding it in that order and it has been executing in 
that order. In any case, would it make more sense to only do it once for 
each hook? If it doesn't work, then wouldn't it be more wise to call 
ksort($wp_filter, SORT_NUMERIC), instead since it would be quicker.

The patch does this and pushes the hook name into the parameter list for 
the all functions.

I did not see where you've done this, but I've added it in another 
parameter for the all hook calling function. You can find the code in 
the patch in the ticket.

What I meant, was that it didn't make sense to append the hook name to 
current filter and then pop it out. Although, what I didn't realize was 
that the all hooks could have called current_filter() to get the current 
hook instead of passing it to the all hooks via a parameter. Therefore 
the all hooks will now have to keep the first parameter as the hook name 
and test all of the rest. This might add additional complexity that 
wouldn't have been needed otherwise. Not to mention it was made 
optional, which might have to be fixed.

I see. Hmm, I still think that the all hooks should only be called if 
the tags exist and not otherwise. This is what would have happened 
before the change. If the filter or action didn't exist then the all 
hooks wouldn't have been called. I think it would be better to keep this 
behavior unless you want to track how many filters and hooks don't have 
hooks.

I think putting them on pages would be the best thing, since it's simple and
easy to navigate to.

With the WordPress Plugin Repository, anybody else that uses it will be told
if there's any updates. Other than that, I'd say it's personal preference.

My advice is to have the plugin define new URLs. For example, you 
could make it so that
    whatever.com/swim_meets
gives the swim meet schedule that your plugin would generate.

To do this, you need to do some programming with the Query Vars and 
Rewrite Rules. See this article in the Codex (Custom Archives and 
Permalinks for Custom Archives sections should get you going):
      http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries

You might also need to override template selection using the 
template_redirect action, which I guess there is currently not an 
article on. Hmmm. Maybe I'd better write one, or add to the Custom 
Queries article. There is a very short example on this page:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference
but it is not all that useful.

Well, I'll add that to the To Do list.

Meanwhile, here is part of a template loader function I used for 
loading some custom templates for a plugin I did for a client. Of 
course, you will also need to write the custom templates and 
distribute them with your plugin. But you would need to do that if the 
plugin created pages too.

add_action('template_redirect', 'confmgr_template_loader' );
function confmgr_template_loader()
{
   global $wp_query;

   $template = '';
   $q = $wp_query->query_vars;

   if( isset( $q[ 'conference' ] ) && isset( $q[ 'sponsors' ])) {
     $template = TEMPLATEPATH . "/sponsors.php";
   } else if( isset( $q[ 'conference' ] ) && isset( $q[ 'sponsor' ])) {
     $template = TEMPLATEPATH . "/featured_sponsor.php";
   } // other clauses omitted for sake of brevity

   if( strlen( $template ) && file_exists( $template )) {
     include( $template );
     exit;
   }

   // if we get here, just use the default WP template chooser

}


Hope this helps,

You know, for true performance, it would be better to tap into C/C++ and 
just write an PHP extension for this part. Yes, it won't be available to 
the majority of WordPress users, but for those wanting more performance, 
it appears it would be the best choice.

While, those points noted need to be addressed, I'm not certain all of 
them need to be corrected in userland. From what I've seen of several 
benchmarks, call_user_func takes more time than each or next. I think 
Travis setup is what is causing the decrease. When I submit the next 
patch, it won't have the do...while loop change over to foreach nor will 
it "correct" merged_filters.

I'm going to be at linux.conf.au 2008 [1] in January/February next
year (Melbourne). Are there any other fellow WP hackers that'll be
going? If so, some sort of meetup could be organised.

It would have been cool to have a WordPress miniconf for LCA2008
(could be branded as a WordCamp), but I think it's too late to suggest
one for 2008's conference. 2009, maybe?

If you don't already know, linux.conf.au is one of the world's best
Linux (and open source in general) conferences, with attendees from
all over the world. In 2008, it's being hosted in Melbourne. Check out
[1] to see what you're missing out on.

Where I've needed to do this before,  I've done an include of
wp-blog-header.php at the top of the code (it lives at the root of the

You might first do this JUST for the admin user, then see if you can  
fix some things once you're logged back in.  I don't know how badly  
you hosed your tables, but the smaller step might save some hassle. :)

Hi there!

I am releasing versions quite often. Mainly these are small fixes,
because some hoster has some kind of strange configuration or I added a
simple option someone wanted. For most users these updates are not

Is there a simple way to find out which is the stable tag? Of course I
could parse the readme.txt in the trunk, but I was wondering whether
there is a more simple way.

Hmm, bad wording!

My Idea was to show the changelog of the latest released stable version,
so the user can decide whether to update or not. This version is not
equal to the latest version of the trunk. Therefore I need to know which
is the latest stable. I was just wondering whether there is some meta
information hanging around I can use. Otherwise I'll just parse the
readme.txt in the trunk.

1. I don't have an email from you.
2. From reading earlier messages in this thread it seems like it's

Try this using phpmyadmin:
1.  Go to your WordPress database.
2.  Select the wp_usermeta table.
3.  Click on "Browse" at the top of the right-hand panel.
4.  For each user (login username = nickname in this table), you'll have a
wp_capabilities row.  Click on the pencil in that row to enter edit mode.
5.  Replace the contents of the meta_value with

a:1:{s:13:"administrator";b:1;}

This will reset that user to purely an administrator.

6.  In wp_options, do the same thing to "active_plugins", resetting it to

a:0:{}

This will deactivate all of your plugins, including Role Manager, and should
let you login.

1) Not sure what happened, it was sent 24/10/07 10:35 to m ~at- 
mullenweg~com from the address I use to post to the list.

2) I think the consensus from people who responded is that adding the 
option to specify a subdirectory would be useful. It's backwards 
compatible, I don't see any down side nor have I noticed any objections.

Is there a WPMU svn list somewhere? I can't see it on 
lists.automattic.com[1], I see wpmu-trac but not wpmu-svn.

If it doesn't exist, can we create it? Seems like it would be 
particularly useful for people following WPMU development as the stable 
releases can be less frequent than WP.

Well - there's always a down side:  figuring out how it should work,  
time in making it happen, documenting it, etc.  More importantly, one  
goal of the WordPress Plugin Directory is to make downloading and  
installing experience for all plugins to be as consistent as possible  
for the user.  How do we ensure that experience is the same for  
plugins using the subdirectory feature and for those that don't?

There are however compelling reasons to offer such a feature.  So  
let's talk about how it should happen.


Situation:

I have a plugin called Wonder Plugin hosted at http://svn.wp- 
plugins.org/wonder-plugin/.  Suppose I have files that look like this:

/wonder-plugins/tags/2.1/readme.txt
/wonder-plugins/tags/2.1/tests.php
/wonder-plugins/tags/2.1/release/wonder.php

And a readme.txt file *in trunk/* with the following line:

Stable Tag: 2.1/release


Proposal:

The Plugin directory will package the zip file from the release/  
subdirectory of the 2.1 tag rather than zipping up everything.

The zip file will contain the readme.txt file as well, even though  
the readme.txt file is not in the release/ directory.  (If there is  
another readme.txt file in the release/ directory it will get  
*overwritten*).

The zip file will contain all of those files (release/* and  
readme.txt) wrapped in a directory called wonder-plugin/.  So the  
contents of the zip will look like:

wonder-plugin/readme.txt
wonder-plugin/wonder.php

The zip file will be named wonder-plugin.zip.

Zip files from other tags (downloaded from the "other versions" link,  
e.g. http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/podpress/download/) will  
contain the *entire* SVN tree.  Why?  We determine the "packaging  
subdirectory" from the readme file in trunk/.  The directory  
structure can change between tags, so we can't know from trunk/ 
readme.txt what the right thing to do is for any tag but the stable  
one.  We could parse each tag's readme.txt, but I'm not convinced  
that's useful for plugin authors or users.  This is *inconsistent*.   
Is that bad?

If the plugin had specified Stable Tag: trunk/release, everything  
above would apply with the trunk/ dir taken to be the stabel "tag"  
dir. (Stable Tag: trunk is equivalent to not including a Stable Tag  
field.  Including it is best practice.)

If the plugin had no subdirectory in its Stable Tag field, the entire  
tag directory is packaged in the zip (this is what happens now).

Thoughts?

Could we consider wonder-plugin-v1.2.3.zip? Getting SVN version could be
the default, unless a version string can be extracted from the plugin /
README.

SOT: I've often wondered why WP.org serves up latest.tar.gz (or .zip),
remaining unspecific about both the version and the actual software name
contained in the download file.

My 2 cents, in no particular order, as I read your plugin source
(didn't try it). Consider that each of the following points starts
with "in my humble opinion" :)

- function widget_accordion_init() seems mostly useless: $option is
always undefined, so adding option then immediately getting option is
pointless

- $here in function accordion_head() is hardcoded, which is bad: if a
user renames the directory, the plugin breaks. Let the plugin guess
its own directory using plugin_basename() or something similar

- jquery is bundled with most WP version, so it's a waste of bandwidth
to include your own. Also, it's better to use wp_enqueue_script() to
add a javascript. This way you make sure it's loaded once. This is a
nice wrap up for this:
<http://nickohrn.com/loading-javascript-libraries-in-wordpress-plugins-with-wp_enqueue_script/>

- it's always a good habit to make good use of nonces &
attribute_escape() when playing with POST stuff. Nice tutorial about
this: <http://blogsecurity.net/wordpress/articles/article-280507/>

- const NUM_PLUGINS look like a candidate for a widget option, why hardcode it ?

- you're using jquery, but you're javascript is plain old stuff.
document.getElementById("accordion-" + n) instead of
jQuery('#accordion-'+n) or el.style.display = "block" instead of
jQuery(this).show(), etc... You can make your javascript shorter and
cuter.

- the plugin could also be less intrusive and more nicely degradable
(when doing stuff with JS, think "how things are going to look like
with JS disabled, or when the page is printed")
For instance, instead of :
<a href="#" onclick="dostuff()">
which is confusing with JS disabled, you can preferably do:
<span id="dostuff">
and:
jQuery('#dostuff').click(function(){dostuff();});
which is much less intrusive since it degrades to correct html with no JS.
It would make sense to me that when there is no JS, the 3 tab contents
from your accordion are displayed, or the 2 tabs with hidden content
are hidden too (it makes no sense to have an empty link on "Comment"
that does nothing when clicked)

</my 2 cents>

Cheers

FYI,  the database file is set to rwx for everyone, as is the containing

sqlite

I've set up a version of wordpress for sqlite on my ipod touch;  however
updates to the database aren't happening.

Oh wise wp-hackers;  do you have any suggestions for what I might be able to
try setup wise to get this to work?

(I set up wordpress for sqlite on my mac,  and that all works properly;  and
when I plunk that database file on to my ipod,  it reads data from the
database just fine.)

FYI,  the database file is set to rwx for everyone, as is the containing
folder;  so it doesn't _seem_ to be a permissions issue.

All right, I can finally reply to this (crazy busy at work).

First: woohoo, and yes, please send in the criticism and suggestions:  
that's what's made the product so cool. We had a good idea, but user  
feedback is what made it a winner, right from the beginning when  
people suggested to go on and support all mobile devices.

Second: thanks to everybody involved, and most particularly my  
teammates and our user base.

Third: now on to releasing 1.4.1 tonight with the last round of  
updates in the svn dev branch. :)

Fourth: Thank you Matt for the extra attention with the runner up  
prizes our *opponents*. These guys did a great job too.

Cheers,

Stephane

It would be more useful if it 302 redirected to the current release. 
Otherwise wget downloads a file called latest.tar.gz which is 
immediately out of date (you have to download it every time to know it's 
current).

Looking at this more closely makes things more difficult, indeed. How
about adding an option instead of enhancing one.

Stable Tag: 2.1
Release Path: release

So where is the advantage? The inconsistency will be solved. "Release
Path" is read from the directory that is packed. This would even work
for older versions, changing the readme.txt in your tag-dir. As long as
the trunk-dir-tree is the same as the tag-dir-tree there shouldn't be
any problems. - At least I can't see any. Of course packing everything
would be fall back.

Cheers
Morty

P.s.: Can you change my dir-name from post-notification to
post_notification? - If it isn't too much trouble. Otherwise it would be
nice to have an option how to name the directory, too.

It's the same problem.

Either we look at each tag's readme file and parse a subdirectory or  
a Release Path tag or whatever, or we just look at trunk's readme  
file.  If doing this for every tag is useful/makes more sense/is a  
better user experience, that's fine.  We just need to convince  
ourselves of that.

The dir-name will always be the same as your SVN repo name: post- 
notification in your case.  That way your svn repo, the url in the  
plugin directory, the plugin zip, and the directory the plugin zip  
contains all have the same name.  I don't see any reason a plugin  
should want to or be able to change that.

As an aside, WP has always used hyphens for files and urls over  
underscores.  It's what sets us apart from MT :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress PHP Extension
Message-ID: <473A84CE.2080904@santosj.name>

Midgard[1] has it, ADODB has it, why not WordPress[2]? I suppose, this 
is better split in two parts.

The first part is the question of whether anyone has explored this for 
WordPress before. If so, how did they fare? There are a few challenges 
of building and maintaining a PHP Extension that requires constant 
maintenance. If anyone has known of anyone doing so, can they let me know?

The obvious answer of why there isn't one, is because WordPress 
development is constantly evolving and keeping up with even a small team 
would be difficult. How the two projects above handled it was to take 
the most time consuming parts and place them in C/C++ code and call 
those functions, if they exist, where needed.

It is not impossible to translate PHP code to C/C++, even with MySQL 
connections intact. There are two ways to go about it. However, if you 
are going to develop an optimized, you'll want to hook into PDO or the 
underlying API that the MySQL extension itself uses to push it that much 
further.

It really goes beyond Opcode Caching to a realm slightly faster than 
that. Having access to the underlying C/C++ code allows for usage of 
quicker structures than Hashes.

I thought about it. Just a thought really. Would anyone be interested in 
this exercise in entertainment (building PHP extensions is fun, honest)? 
Thought I would ping the hackers to see what your opinion is on the 
matter. Really, I wouldn't have thought about it, if it wasn't the 
discussion on optimizing the Plugin API (still have to submit that 
updated patch).

[2] The main setback would be that not many users has access to 
compiling PHP (or know how to compile PHP), therefore the audience of 
such an specialized Extension would be small.

There's your problem right there, I'd say that most people are running
WordPress on shared hosts, and they don't have root access to the server.

I suppose it would appeal more to the people running WordPress on a
dedicated server. Since they're probably under high-load, the Extension
would be something they could use to speed up WordPress a bit.

Or, for hosts that offer WordPress-specific host (Managed Blog Hosting),
where mostly WordPress blogs would be on a server.

I just subscribe to Trac's RSS feed ? same diff. Here's one that  
displays just the changesets, but if you go to the Timeline yourself,  
you can change it to include ticket creations, etc.:

It actually downloads as wordpress-2.3.1.tar.gz if you do it with  
Firefox. That's because of the Content-Disposition header sent by the  
web server. Have a look:

In particular, this:

This tells the browser what filename to save the file as, but  
unfortunately wget doesn't support that header, for some reason. I  
guess it makes it easier to predict the filename when running it from  
a script; but I guess if you were scripting it, you'd use the -O  
argument to force it to have a particular filename.

You can save it with whatever filename you choose, but simply 
downloading latest.tar.gz doesn't tell you which version it is, unless 
you check wp-includes/version.php. If it were to redirect to 2.3.1.tgz 
then you'd know the version you were getting, and could therefore figure 
out which was the latest...

One shouldn't write emails late at night in a foreign language.  ;-)
The Idea was to have a "global" and a "local" option.
The global one is "Stable Tag" and always read from the trunk. This is
more or less the information where the "latest"-link should go.
Release Path is a local option. It's read from the tag that is going to
be ziped. If you have a different directory tree in your trunk and your
tag, you have to change this option in your tag after tagging. Not nice,
but at least it's possible.
Hope it makes more sense this time ;-)

Looks like I have to do some work on dir-names.... :-/

I think putting them on pages would be the best thing, since it's simple and
easy to navigate to.

My advice is to have the plugin define new URLs. For example, you 
could make it so that
    whatever.com/swim_meets
gives the swim meet schedule that your plugin would generate.

To do this, you need to do some programming with the Query Vars and 
Rewrite Rules. See this article in the Codex (Custom Archives and 
Permalinks for Custom Archives sections should get you going):
      http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries

[ ... snipped ... ]


Hope this helps,
     --Jennifer


[ ... snipped ... ]

After looking at these two suggestions, I think for the time being, I am
going to go with simply adding pages with wp_insert_post().  It may not be
as elegant and the query vars and rewrite rules solution but it looks like
it will be a whole lot less complicated (ie work) and right now I am more
focused on getting something up and running so I can do some validation with
the swim team coaches and leadership committee to make sure all of our needs
are met.

Thanks for the advice!

Mike

Hello there

Something I've always missed is integration of user profiles into the site 
rather than the admin area. I don't want readers to leave my blog for a 
generic wp-admin/user page my theme has no control over. Drupal does it, 
MT seems to be doing something similar (and more) [1]

The idea I'd like to throw around is: what about a new file template for 
themes, say profile.php, that would if exists be used to display & manage 
your profile (as it is now: password, url, aim etc)

Any thought on this? On what it would imply, require, ... ?

You're going about the long way...

There are already exist PHP compilers (not converters to C++, but stuff that
actually converts PHP to assembly directly) by MS and Roadsend.

The first is Phalanger, an open-source CLR implementation of PHP that comes
with a support for compliing an einter PHP project as a single DLL/binary.
Second is Roadsend PHP, an open-source PHP interpreter NOT based on the
original PHP code, that can also compile PHP directly to a FastCGI
executable.

I haven't had much luck with either w/ WordPress.

How do you end up clicking on a user's profile?

I think the most common (if not only) way is through clicking on the 
author in a post. Clicking on a name in a comment takes you to the 
user's url, not their profile page.

So the only profiles that will be seen are the profiles of authors on 
the site. In which case, these users are already familiar with the admin 
interface (to write a post).

So overall, I don't see a reason to implement this feature in core. I 
don't think it would be particularly hard in a plugin though.

This raises an interesting point though, the admin interface is not 
particularly easy to theme. It might be nice to add a few more hooks to 
allow greater customisation of it.

Cheers - Callum.

I think we're all waiting for Matt, et al., to commit the Happy Cog
stuff to trunk/ before we even begin thinking about that.  There's
just too much that is 1) unknown and 2) bound to change.

Besides, folks[1] have already done a lot[2] to mod up the admin
interface in the past.

What is Happy Cog? I've never heard of it...

The Tiger Administration and Admin Drop Down Menu are nice, but they 
only modify the existing admin interface, they don't provide anything in 
addition to it. For example, we're developing a WPMU site with our own 
themed header above and below the WP Admin interface. A couple of hooks 
(like wp_admin_header and wp_admin_footer) could be really helpful here. 
For example, being able to replace the standard admin-header.php and 
admin-footer.php files would be quite easy yet very powerful.

A small thing I noticed with regards to restyling the admin interface, 
there is no "wrapper" div tag. So there is no way to reduce the width 
and centre the whole page.

I think these items could be fixed with a few lines of code, and could 
make the WP Admin interface much more easily customisable.

I'm curious to know more about Happy Cog though, I'm hoping it's some 
super themable new admin system which will obsolete this discussion! :)

Cheers - Callum.

Just curious, but this function only works IF the authors choose to use 
it correct? I didn't really get into it's functions, nor have tried it 
out yet. I was wondering, is there a way to maybe have it kick in, once 
an author, contributor, etc etc... submits a post? I mean, maybe have it 
set to automatically have users below the admin level ... go right to 
status pending... for admins to approve after reviewing them? Thanks in 
advanced. I wanted to send this before going to work...

What I'm saying is that the Content-Disposition header is already  
doing the _same_thing_ that a redirect would be doing ? it's just  
that wget doesn't support the header. If it supported the Content- 
Disposition header and only downloading headers, then you'd know the  
version you were getting, and could therefore figure out which was  
the latest, simply by running a "HEAD /latest.tar.gz HTTP/1.1"

On the other hand, if wp.org returned a redirect, all clients would 
work, including wget! ;-)

Related proposal: create a new "Submit for Review" in place of where  
the Publish button would be. That would make the feature much more  
obvious to use.

Happy Cog is a design studio, who are apparently going to work on a

I hope that all they do behind closed-doors is a rough outline and then 
they'll come to the community to let us vote on what elements to keep, 
change, or take out all together.

I guess I should have worded that a bit differently. I meant that they 
should have it done, but maybe there are a few smaller aspects that the 
small group can't agree on. If they can't agree on something, they can 
put out a call on the wp-hackers or wp-testers list and see what people 
thing. Any major decisions should be left up to them!

Design decisions in a vacuum are worse. If we're all busy hoping, I hope
they have focus groups made up of real users. The list generally has
plenty of real users, too, which is why it'd be nice to see some of that
question askin' going on here (bonus transparency).

I didn't say reach agreements on the list. I mentioned focus groups and
question' askin'.

Agreement isn't necessary to answer a question, and it's not necessary
to do research to better understand your users and their needs. "What's
your favorite color?" can get a dozen different answers, as can "what
do you most frequently do with the Admin interface?" There isn't really
a wrong answer to either, but each can be useful in making design
decisions.

The hardest part about using the list for focus group activities would
be to keep people focused on outlining problems (*not* solutions), and
preventing people from getting sidetracked in unproductive arguments
over opinion. Aside from that, this list would be a dream come true for
marketing research -- it's full of a bunch of talkative folks who
already use the product, care about its development, and are willing to
share their thoughts for free.

To specifically respond to your example -- there was a lot of
discussion re. what the commenting convention should be, but the
take-away was that certain folks had certain needs that could be solved
by a common commenting convention. That's just one solution, though,
and the conversation spiraled around the solution, and not the problems
that needed to be solved (documentation; specifically, "When the f***
was that function introduced?"). Note that Ozh _solved that problem_,
but using a completely different means[1].

The list is good at finding problems. Maybe not so good at finding
solutions, but it's good at finding problems. And you have to know what
the problems are, and where they are, before you can try and attempt to
engineer solutions.

I don't use it, but that's how I thought it already works for people who 
don't have the capability to publish posts.

Message-ID: <003301c82735$44ab8320$0300a8c0@Toshiba>

I'm trying to give ticket #4642 a push.  This change is to leverage the 
post_status of pending when the Blog By Email feature is used by someone who 
isn't allowed to publish posts.  Right now, everything gets published 
immediately, even if the user is unknown.

The ticket has a few versions of patches, with different implementations, as 
suggested by westi and ryan.  4642.3.diff adds the function 
get_userdatabyemail; this is the one I prefer.  4642.5.diff adds the 
function get_user_by; this was suggested by ryan.  Both versions were 
tested.

I think this change is a good enhancement, and changes the behavior to 
something that's intuitive.  Can one of you guys decide what you want to do 
with this and commit it?  I don't want to miss the 2.4 boat.

If I remember correctly, all there is is a "Save" button. To submit for
pending review, you have to find the obscure radio button on the
sidebar.

Better yet, use the Apple SDK (when released) to create an iPhone app. Only
this time the winner gets...

Yeah, that's what's there now. The "Save and Continue Editing", "Save", 
and "Publish" button(s). The thing is, even if you'd tell your authors 
to choose "Pending Review", alot of them would/could forget that, and 
just keep posting posts without them being reviewed by the Admin at all. 
I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing though. I'm just saying, 
for SOME admins they'd like their authors posts to be reviewed BEFORE 
submitted/published and made live on the blog.

Especially if they have forgetful authors, or authors that don't give a 
rats behind about the admins wishes. It would be nice to have THAT 
option controlled by the admin, once an author is made. Perhaps maybe on 
the "Edit User" page, or in the general User section of the control 
panel. Admins could maybe select the option for all Authors, 
Contributors, Editors,  and etc, have their posts automatically set the 
"Status Pending".

So for example: If I'd have 4 Authors on my Blog, but rather have ALL 
their posts "pending review" by me FIRST. That nothing will show on the 
blog at all! Until I'd see them there the next day, review it, then 
publish it for them. It kinda makes that status pointless if there's no 
control behind it... Cause sure as heck, most authors that want to post 
a post, won't give a rats behind about sending their posts to "Pending 
Review" first. IMHO, while the status is there, go forth with some 
control as well. =P

This not only gives the option for Admin control, but it still allows 
the users the chance to choose it (pending review status) if they so 
desire too. (That being when or if the admin don't choose their posts 
are automatically "pending review" that is.)

Looking at the code in edit-form-advanced.php, I see the following check:

  if ( current_user_can('publish_posts') )

If the test fails, the user sees "Submit for Review" instead of "Publish". 
Doesn't that do exactly what you want?  All you'd need to do is take away 
the "Publish Posts" capability, or make the users Contributors.

You probably want this change if you use this feature:

What, creating an app for the proprietary iPhone platform will be better
than one that will run on the open Android platform?

Have you tried using author templates? The post loop could be a very 
small part of the page, you could focus on the rest and pull things in 
from usermeta using the built-in functions.

And don't forget, the OHA/Android spec calls for OpenGL support (at
least on the high-end devices).  Think of the niftiness (dare I say
"Leopard-ness"?) that clever devs will be able to wrangle the devices
into with that sort of hardware backing...!

I must admit, there's a great deal to having an OPEN SDK right now,
with known license and usage restrictions, as opposed to having a
promised one whose constraints, "code signing", licenses, etc., are
not yet even known to those outside of Cupertino.

Replying to myself here:
Even if we have a great SDK release from Apple, just how many
Objective C compilers do YOU know of for Linux and Windows?  And yet,
Java/Eclipse/Ant all exist and work well on just about every platform
out there.

Heck, we may well see dedicated OpenBSD Android hackers... *grin*

Have you tried using author templates? The post loop could be a very 
small part of the page, you could focus on the rest and pull things in 
from usermeta using the built-in functions.

In this same vein, is there to have the user land back at the page they were
visiting prior to logging in?  I would like to do that as opposed to landing
on the dashboard or at least have it as an option.

Great stuff, and viper, I've got a couple of dozen other things you 
could code for me as well? :) But seriously, this should be in core :)

I disagree about it should be in the core as I think most people including
me think the whole purpose of logging in is to go to the admin area. But
that's one of the many greatnesses of WordPress though -- if you don't like
something, chances are you can change it via a plugin.

RE: coding. Sure, but you'll have to pay me for my time. :P  [/offtopic]

Shame there aren't any phones to actually run the code that's

Apple has a large install base of 1.4 million+ and don't forget that  
iPhones have teh sexy. Seriously, I don't think good SDKs sell  
handsets. I do understand your grievances about Apple, but they have a  
good brand, tight UI and great industrial design, I think that's all  
they need in this space.

But to bring this back to a kind of WordPress oriented discussion. I  
wouldn't spend any time on a WPhone style Android application until  
there is a market for them beyond a few developers inside of Google. I  
don't think this is a no-brainer direction for developers like the  
iPhone was.

Oh... congratulations on winning the contest by the way. Do you plan  
to combine efforts with the other entrants to make a super-dooper  
plugin?

Well, technically, that'd be "consumer level" phones. A wider aray of  
devs outside of Google are also bound to have access to prototypes  
relatively shortly, OpenMoko style.

Can't really disagree with this though.

Yup, that makes sense too, unless you're in the prize money market,  
and is why I'll personally focus on WPhone for that platform for now.  
What it comes down to is that the web based paradigm works well, and  
has the advantage of being cross-platform.

I have bigger plans (read: pipe dreams) for Android anyway. ;)

Thanks. :)

re: merging/combining: Ultimately, if it makes sense for the product  
and the user base, I'm still all for it.

Thanks a bunch, this worked perfectly.

[ ... snipped ... ]

I disagree about it should be in the core as I think most people including
me think the whole purpose of logging in is to go to the admin area. But
that's one of the many greatnesses of WordPress though -- if you don't like
something, chances are you can change it via a plugin.

[ ... snipped ... ]

I think it is situation dependent.  In my case, people will login to
interact with a plugin I am developing and the content which goes with it.
It will be exposed to the end user via Pages.  Very few people will login to
interact with the dashboard in the traditional WP sense.

Thanks again,

Mike

All you need is the redirect_to, as Viper showed. Our logged-in comment 
template does this by default.

I've been thinking about taking our UI and using the WPhone backend but with
the non-existent time I have it's not going to happen in any reasonable
time.

Message-ID: <000001c827ac$d51f36f0$7f5da4d0$@net>

I just posted an article on my blog (WP SVN), and was surprised to find a
link from that article - to a previous article I had written  on the same
blog - flagged as spam by Akismet.

 

IMHO, internal pingbacks should be added directly, without *any* spam
checking..

 

I was wondering if there was any previous discussion on the topic before I
bugged it?

Interesting, I always considered that internal pingbacks shouldn't 
appear at all, but I suppose they could be useful in some way.

I agree, if they're going to be posted, they should bypass spam 
checking. Will that need to be a change in Akismet or a change in WP? Is 
there a way to exclude something from spam checking? (I haven't looked 
into that part of the code).

Cheers - Callum.

Proof'll be in the pudding next year, I suppose.  HTC looks like

Good SDKs don't sell handsets, true, but it's ironic: Apple's good
phone may end up selling a Good SDK.  Prior to the iPhone, most
Americans h-a-t-e-d HATED their phones, and with good cause.  They're
crippled, they're annoying, they're non-intuitive, and they're
expensive.  "Decent" mobile OSes barely existed. Then along came the
iPhone and people realized that they not only could avoid hating their
phones, they could even love them.

However, as the jailbreak/anti-jailbreak dance has shown, one of the
biggest things that (tech-savvy) users have taken away from the iPhone
is just how much potential there is in the space.  Developers'
frustrations with the WWDC "Safari IS our SDK" crap (I was in the room
and heard the snorts of derision when Jobs tried that one on for size)
are evident.  They're looking for a great platform to peddle their
wares _in a fashion of largely their own choosing_.  It's at this last
point that I predict Apple's February solution will likely fall down.

Or, I could be gob-smackingly shortsighted and we might end up with a
new Mobile Delicious Generation, rendered smoke, neon glows and all.

True.  Apple does simple well.  Google does spartan well.  It remains
to be seen which ends up being more attractive to more people.  I
still think Google may come out the better for not being shackled hand
and foot to the corpse that is at&(ptui!)t.

Oh! Thanks for reminding me!

I had really liked how modular Mobile Admin is and was considering using
that idea to make our's a bit more flexible. Then again, our plan is/was to
have the one interface be runnable on ALL phones and then spruce it up with
additional JS and CSS depending on how powerful the phone is.

But still, plenty each plugin could benefit from each other, that's for
sure.

I'm eager to get Matt's and the judge's (?) feedback to see what they  
have to say. :)
Itchy to get their suggestions implemented, where appropriate, before  
starting to take on new features.

So it shows up for Subscribers only, then?

I think the best thing to do would be to have a checkbox that says something
like  "All posts made by this user must be approved by an Administrator
before being published" when creating a user or editting a user.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Unified HTTP Request API
Message-ID: <473D3526.1070108@santosj.name>

I brought this up in the past [1] and was brought up again[2] on trac. 
It seems that the moment is right to jump start it again. I wasn't too 
happen with the prototypes I started before. The goal has to be that it 
is as quick as possible and as easy as possible. It is only meant to be 
internal replacement for fsockopen function calls and not something that 
is fully functional. Meaning that it is not a replacement for Snoopy.

The base structure that I have so far is

class WP_HTTP_Base
{
    function test() { }
    function post($headers, $body) { }
    function get($headers, $body) { }
    function request($url, $headers=null, $body=null) { }
    function setHeaders($headers) { }
    function getHeaders($headers) { }
    function setBody($body) { }
    function getBody($body) { }
    function setTimeout($timeout) { }
}

class WP_HTTP_Fsockopen extends WP_HTTP_Base { }
class WP_HTTP_Fopen extends WP_HTTP_Base { }
class WP_HTTP_Curl extends WP_HTTP_Base { }
class WP_HTTP_Streams extends WP_HTTP_Base { }
class WP_HTTP_ExtHTTP extends WP_HTTP_Base { }

The purpose of the test() method is to see if the method can be used 
which would ask a few questions. It would be used to first test the 
server environment and then save the answer so that it doesn't have to 
keep asking. It will save to the options and check periodically. Based 
on the preferred list for either PHP 4 or PHP 5, the first one that 
succeeds would be used to fetch a URL. If all fail, then an user error 
would be thrown. It could also be used for the install process to check 
whether the server would allow for fetching URLs.

For Fsockopen:

1. Is Fsockopen in the disabled functions list.

For Fopen:

1. Is Allow_url_fopen set to enable (all PHP version supported by WordPress)
2. Is fopen in the disabled functions list.

For cURL:

1. Is the cURL extension installed and available.

For Streams:

It seems that prior to 4.3.0, all external URLs had to be retrieved 
using fsockopen, because streams mean using different protocols in 
fopen. This is actually, the $context usage allowed in PHP 5.0 and thus 
uses fopen and stream context usage. Supposely benchmarks (debatable) 
state that this method is faster.

1. Is PHP version greater than 5.0
2. Is Allow_url_fopen enabled

For ExtHTTP:

1. Is HTTP extension installed (and perhaps whether PHP 5.2 is 
installed, however the extension doesn't need PHP 5.2).

The rest of the methods should be self explanatory. Yeah, it doesn't do 
a lot, but it isn't meant to. It fetches the URL and allows for both the 
body and headers to be parsed separately.

The complete function will rest in a single function, 
wp_fetch_remote_url($url, $headers, $body), which will test all the 
classes and return the result from the ones that succeeds or return 
false if none of them do.

I'm writing for input on any thoughts on the current prototyped API and 
thoughts on whether such an patch would be worth placing in the core of 
WordPress. Are any WordPress devs working on something similar?

My feelings exactly.

Here's the ticket: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5362

This isn't an Akismet issue; Akismet uses the API to check for pending
comments - intra-site pingbacks shouldn't be there in the first place.

You can do that now by assigning users the correct roles -

"Author - Somebody who can publish and manage their own posts"
"Contributor - Somebody who can write and manage their posts but not publish 
posts"

See: http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities

You want to require a user's posts be approved first, simply make them a 
'Contributor'.  Problem solved.

If you need finer control, use the Role Manager plugin.

I disagree. This is an Akismet issue.

Your solution would be to avoid filtering local pingback/trackbacks. This is
bad and would break some plugins and would provide no way to filter them at
all.

Akismet needs to be smart enough to ignore ****backs from a local source.

Can you further explain what you're trying to say?

How would not filtering local pingbacks break plugins?
I'm not saying don't apply filters to local pingbacks, just don't apply the
*spam* filter to local pingbacks.

Oh, right, I forgot there was a "spam" filter as to whether it was spam or
not. I for some reason was thinking Akismet used the "new pingback" filter
and then manually marked it as spam.

Dur.

I have noticed this as well.  I would rather internal pingbacks not
occur.  Why would I want to be notified that I linked to another
article on my site?

For me personally, I use internal pingbacks/trackbacks as a way of
informing readers of related articles. In order to accomplish this, I
often have to go through a few awkward steps.

1. Deactivate Akismet.

2. Publish the new article with the link and trackback to the old article.

3. Reactivate Akismet

4. Retrieve my pingback from the spambox.


It's always seemed curious to me that my pingback is flagged as spam
when I have no spam plugin enabled, but there it is. This behavior is
very consistent, so I've never been sure of it's by design.

Just curious... how long as it been since anyone's received a
pingback/trackback that was not flagged as spam?

It's an easy way of showing your readers that there's a followup to that 
post, if they landed on that old post from a search engine for instance.

You can prevent it from happening with this plugin:

Most of my pingbacks go through without a problem.
In the past I was using SK2 w/ Akismet plugin, which manually recovered them
(I think).

Since switching to only Akismet I've made two posts - pingbacks from the
first were flagged as spam, the second as ham.

If that's happening then it has nothing to do with Akismet.

You probably have a bad rule in your Options > Discussion blacklist 
that's catching things.

It's better to mark it correctly and train Akismet, because if it's 
being marked on your site it'll be marked on someone else's site too.

What you've described seems very complicated for what should be simple 
operations, ideally a single-line function call.

I have a better idea:

How about Akismet does that on its own?

Seriously, a blog user shouldn't have to go into the spam to de-spam his/her
own comments.. Same way comments from site author are always exempt,
pingbacks are no different.... what is the difference between the two?

I guess having Akismet auto-sumbit and force-ham all pingbacks by same blog
and comments by authors would be a good compromise, no?

Let WordPress automatticaly do it for its users, they'll appreciate it :)

So Evil Spammy could internally trackback a few thousands of their own
posts on their own blog so that Akismet think they're not spammers ;)

I think Akismet should just bypass checking, if anything. Actually
getting yourself marked as spam could be a good indicator of things :P

Just finished by 500th post day before yesterday, this is the first time
I've failed to see a pingback make it to its final destination, whether to
my blog or otherwise :)

This is a separate "issue" (the current action is intended).

Use a plugin to disable it:

Yeah. That is what I'm proposing, a single line function call that uses 
classes to retrieve URLs. It should be fairly easy after all.

Well, I wrote up a quick prototype [1] of what I mean. Not production 
quality, nor is it finished. The hard parts are in implementing the 
request method for each class.

A couple of ideas. I have implementations for GET, but I haven't wrote 
the functions for POST, however, I believe Snoopy is used for that 
purpose, so no doubt that it won't be needed, but would be super easy to 
create.

I was wondering if I should finish it and how likely that it would be 
included in to WordPress (if not, then what I could do to get it to that 
point). I'm actually more proud of this version than the last permutation.

This looks interesting.

If we are going to develop an internal API to remove the multiple calls
littered around the code then we need to review whether or not we should
just extend snoopy or if we are going to replace it remove it completely
from being called by core code and deprecate it later.

For the core implementation we should concentrate on the 2 or 3
implementations that cover 90%+ of the install base and leave the more
esoteric ones as plugin territory.

Yes, I agree with this. This wasn't about Roles though, this is about 
having a "feature" in the core, and being able to have some possible 
control behind THAT feature. I already had the Role Manager plugin 
before, and to be frank, it SUCKED. Manually having to choose tons of 
various "rights" for a user, sucks. The ability to control that new 
feature status shouldn't be a difficult task to handle. It's already 
"IN" the core now, why couldn't there be some control behind it? It 
could help minimize the "need" for plugins, and level setting 
itself...You shouldn't have to have a plugin, and or, set certain people 
to Contributors or whatever.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Allowing future posts
Message-ID: <10936E65-EA03-4AF8-992C-65DD77B16DB6@birdhouse.org>

I'm looking for a way to have future-dated posts go live immediately  
rather than waiting for their timestamp to arrive.  IOTW I want posts  
to go live when I hit Publish  even if the timestamp is for two months  
from now (this is for an Events-like publishing system, but I don?t  
want to use an Events plugin for reasons I won?t go into).

  I found that if I change the post_status in wp_posts from ?future?  
to ?publish? then a future-dated post goes live. Good. So I need to  
write a plugin that does one of:

1) When a post is submitted, don?t mark it ?future? even if it is in  
the future, or
2) When displaying the loop, don?t filter out ?future? posts.

Which approach makes more sense / would be easier to write? Or is  
there another way to accomplish this that I'm not finding?

Thanks,
Scot

Setting people to contributors isn't any harder than checking a box
that says "don't let this person publish", and it has the immense
benefit of already being factored into the UI and not taking any other
work. It also integrates gracefully with the role manager plugin
should people want more control (rather than being user-based, meaning
you'd have to edit every user if you changed your posting policy).
What you're describing sounds like it would end up being an outlier
option like the ugly 'visual editor' checkbox.

If anything the whole roles/capabilities thing needs to be
explained/exposed better in the interface so that it's clear to admins
what contributor/author/editor mean without them having to dig around
in the codex looking for definitions. The difference between the roles
has always seemed esoteric to me (because I didn't research it), but
it's very specific and with the new status:pending stuff it's already
very powerful.

For a start, adding a link to the codex page about roles wherever a
role <select> exists (add new user, edit user) would help make the
distiction clearer, though I guess WP has been avoiding that kind of
interface->documentation linkage so far.

Hey all,

I'm just wrapping up work on my first WP plug-in, but there's one  
thing I can't figure out.

I'm adding a top-level menu (as I have 5 child pages), but what I'd  
love to do is have the top-level menu name and the corresponding sub- 
level menu name be different - in the same way that clicking on  
"Write" takes you to the sub-menu called "Write Post".

Is this doable within the plug-in API?  Any ideas or help would be  
grand.

I've searched around, but can't find any discussion of this online or  
in the archives of this list.

Thanks!
Derek

Ugh. Noticed I missed a little something on this, which would certainly 
make visiting individual entries more interesting, but probably not what 
anyone expects.

Gonna go with Joost's suggestion for a name, too...

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: The Future is Now!
Description: Display posts with a timestamp in the future.
Version: R1.0.1
*/

function show_future_where($where) {
	global $wpdb;

	if( !is_single() && !is_page() )
		$where .= " OR $wpdb->posts.post_status = 'future' ";

	return $where;
}

add_filter('posts_where', 'show_future_where');
?>

Hey Derek,

I'm pretty sure add_menu_page() doesn't add a child page. So you could 
simply add a child page with the same page name and function, but a 
different title.

However, if it does add a child page automatically, hook into the 
'admin_menu' action and manually edit the $menu and $submenu variables. 
You can see how they're structured in wp-admin/menu.php - it's pretty 
straightforward.

Cheers,


Callum.

add_menu_page() does indeed add a child with the same name and it can be
rather annoying.

I have a ticket open on the matter: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5100

Meanwhile, you could probably "fix" this by modifying the $submenu array.

Yes, I was thinking about that, having three and leaving the rest as 
something else. It would be even be possible to build a plugin that 
interfaces Snoopy for a backwards compatibility plugin. Since the filter 
is first and all of the other checks last, it is completely possible to 
forego the default checks and replace it with a plugin.

I'm actually not looking to replace Snoopy and looking at it, I couldn't 
extend it without refactoring large portions. I'm not sure what uses it 
(plugins, core), but I can do a search and see.

Well maybe I am doing something wrong - or, more likely - I have  
misinterpreted the question, but this works for me

function sf_admin_menu()
{		
	add_menu_page('Simple Forum', 'Forum', 8, 'sf-adminforums.php');
	add_submenu_page('sf-adminforums.php', 'Manage Forum', 'Manage  
Forums', 8, 'sf-adminforums.php');
	add_submenu_page('sf-adminforums.php', 'Manage Options', 'Manage  
Options', 8, 'sf-adminoptions.php');
}

gives a different 'name' to the first menu item even if it runs the  
same function.
Am  I wrong?

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.4 idea: query/display logic split in admin tools
Message-ID: <0389ED98-D7C8-4607-9A25-30E4CA3806D7@tekartist.org>


Working on WPhone, I often wished that the query and display logics  
were separated, or the recordset returned, in some of the admin  
listing tools.

For example, in /wp-admin/categories.php, the tools makes use of the  
cat_rows() convenience function. The latter both fetches and echos the  
recordset in the desired html format.

As convenient as the above is, making the unformatted recordset  
available to 3rd-party developers would let us further process the  
information, and extend features, without having to replicate the same  
query. Definitely better for performance/security, and so much more.

Same goes for the WP_User_Search class in /wp-admin/users.php, which  
could be so useful to others if not so *aggressive* (echos only) in  
its constructor.

This would be immediately be very helpful to our plugin, but I would  
say would also open the door to other features, such as visualization  
(graphs, img generation, etc).

Opinions? Ideas? Worth a patch/ticket?

I'll say.

One problem that I think I might have brought up before was that the 
business and presentation logic was both in the files, which made it 
extremely difficult to use the functionality outside of the 
administration. That is being fixed, although, probably not because 
whether or not I bought it up (which I might have just said to myself, 
"Damn you WordPress with your business and presentation logic combined 
code!" and not said anything to WP-Hackers, but I bitch a lot so it is 
highly possible I might actually had).

Dare I say, the PEAR Calendar is so damn sexy, I think every library 
should be built like it. Oh yes, it is awesome!

It basically keeps all of the presentation logic completely separated 
from its functionality, and just does the calendar stuff. It doesn't 
even allow you to plug in functionality, but basically by iteration, you 
can build the output yourself. So if you wanted to say, do XML, you can 
do that, or if you want HTML, etc you do it.

Basically, I would totally support the separation, but I won't help. 
I'll tell you straight up right now.

It would probably be difficult, since you would have to have two (or 
more) classes or two or more functions where one was used previously. 
You would also have to keep the original function behavior as it was and 
build a companion for what you are proposing. In this way, you can have 
single functionality separate of both functions but used in both. If 
that makes any sense.

Good luck.

PS: I don't like how print_r() works, so anything that just returns and 
gives you complete control is awesome to me.

This rocks, thanks much. But there's a bug - while it does allow  
future posts to display now, when viewing a category page with this  
enabled, the loop includes posts from outside the current category.  
Somehow it breaks that part of the loop filter. Any tweaks you can  
suggest for that?

Thanks,

Hello,

As far as I know, when you make a future post, wordpress will ping it
in the future only. Is it really true for 2.3.1?

But I found a plugin which said wordpress ping is dangerous to use,
sine when you make a future post, it will ping that post at the time
you press the publish button.

http://www.maxblogpress.com/plugins/mpo/

Any idea? Thanks.

Did I claim it would be trivial? Bugger...

Ok Scot, this *even more* simplistic version seems to work everywhere. I 
  know because I actually bothered to test it this time!

-Kaf

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: The Future is Now!
Description: Display future timestamped posts.

h/t to Joost for the name!

function show_future_where($where) {

OR post_status = \'future\')', $where);
}

add_filter('posts_where', 'show_future_where');

So close and yet so far. This version fixes that bug (thanks!), but  
now future posts are only available when logged in, not to the public.  
One more pass? :)

Isn't the description of the "taxonomy" field a definition for a "ENUM" field ?
Optimisation of disk usage, consistency, and still allows a plugin to
add a permitted value to the ENUM list.
And not as normalized as an external table.

My 2 cents.

Prior to version 2.1, WordPress would ping at the time you hit
"publish," even for future posts.  For versions including 2.1 and
newer, WP sets the status of the post to "future" and uses the
built-in cron to publish the post (and do the associated actions, such
as pinging) at that future time.

Thanks a lot. So information stated on that plugin page is not that accurate.

Again, I totally agree with this. I understand that it's not hard to 
just change a users status to Contributor. I also agree with what you're 
saying about the Roles/Capabilities needing explained better and so 
forth. And heck, that Role Manager plugin, when I used it before... 
SUCKED. It some-what worked, but was also a pain in the f-ing ass too.

I'm not trying to fight for a change in the core. I'm just trying to get 
across my points of view, suggestions, and thoughts about the new 
"Pending Review" status, and throwing out how maybe having some control 
behind it (from an Administrators perspective) will be helpful in general.

Again, here is what I'm saying:

1) No matter what, no matter how easy it is. An Admin shouldn't really 
have to change a user Role to control the users posts in general. - I 
know it's easy to change users status from Author to Contributor... 
Bottom line is, you shouldn't have to change a user status in general to 
control their posts...

With "Pending Review" now in the core, what's it doing really? I mean, 
even if I changed my Authors to Contributors, but later decided that I 
wanted Authors there too, and tell them to set their posts to "Pending 
Review". They could forget it, and just go ahead and publish them 
regardless.

That basically makes "pending review" status pointless, because even 
when you would tell them Authors to do that, they could forget what you 
tell them to do, and they could go ahead and just publish them anyway! 
Which leads to the next thing...

2) The new Pending Review status is there, but there's not much control 
over it at all. Like Matt and I  basically said: "the best thing to do 
would be to have a checkbox that says something like "All posts made by 
this user must be approved by an Administrator before being published" 
when creating a user or editing a user."

OR, a check box under "Users" section that basically says "All posts for 
users under the Administrator  level will be sent to Pending Review. " 
Now, under WRITE > POST. There could be a button title change, from 
"Publish" to "Submit for Review" or whatever. But even then, the 
function behind that button would have to be adjusted so it actually 
submits their posts for Review first. So their posts aren't being 
automatically published. This sounds like alot, or like it's 
complicated, but really it shouldn't be though.

I was talking with Jeremy Visser in Gtalk a little while ago...

Jeremy: you prolly should've set them to contributors, like they said in 
the thread

Spencer: the whole thing isn't about Roles though, it's about control 
behind that "pending review" status

Jeremy: what exactly do you want "control behind"?

Spencer: so, no matter what "role" a user has, the admin could control 
that status pending
like that one other fellow said

Jeremy: sorry, I don't understand
oh wait

Spencer: put check in box, to allow ALL and ANY users posts to "pending 
review"...

Jeremy: you want to be able to get an admin to set it to pending review
because that button is invisible if you're an admin
correct?

Spencer: the "pending review" is always there, i see it myself when 
writing a post
in WRITE > POST
on right side
under "Post Status"
right above "Draft"

Jeremy: right
okay, I was mistaken again :)
but you wrote: "so, no matter what "role" a user has, the admin could 
control that status pending "
an admin can control the status pending, can't he?
he just ticks that box

Spencer: see, i could tell my Authors to choose "Pending Review" .. when 
ever they write up something, but they could forget that, and go ahead a 
post it... No matter what status they have, Author, Contributor, Editor 
etc etc... it would be awesome for the admin to just put check in the 
box under "Users"... so no matter what, all posts go to "Pending Review"

Jeremy: ah, okay
what you really need is just to have a Submit for Review button where 
Publish would be
problem solved

Spencer: that way, none of the users have to be changed Role wise, cause 
no matter what, the posts will be "Pending Review" for anyone below the 
admin level..

Jeremy: your authors would instinctively click there

Spencer: yeah, submit for review .. however, there still has to be 
control there though... cause no matter what the button is called, the 
posts will be published

Jeremy: yeah okay

Again, I'm not trying to fight to get this in the core. I'm just trying 
to make the ideas, thoughts, suggestions, opinions, and points more 
clear here. :P Anyway, I suppose for the mean time I could change those 
Authors to Contributors, kinda sucks though sigh.

Andy,

Thanks, this is correct - Max emailed me off-list and provided a good  
test plug-in that helped me figure it out as well.

Since I have all of my child pages contained within my plug-in file as  
functions, the trick for getting the parent menu tab to link directly  
to the child page is to have them call the same function AND have the  
child-menu call the plug-in file (__FILE__) as its unique identifier.

If you use a different identifier, then you'll end up with two child  
pages with the exact same content - one named as per your top-level  
menu item, and one named as per the identical child item.

Here's the code that worked:

add_menu_page('Page title', 'Top-level menu title', 8, __FILE__,  
'my_magic_function');
add_submenu_page(__FILE__, 'Page title', 'Sub-menu title', 8,  
__FILE__, 'my_magic_function');

Thanks all,
Derek

Off the top off my head, untested:

function setup_future_hook() {
  remove_action('future_post', '_future_post_hook');
  add_action('future_post', 'publish_future_post_now');
}

function publish_future_post_now($id) {
  wp_publish_post($id);
}

add_action('init', 'setup_future_hook');

Chris:
I do believe Shuttle is DOA, unless you're working on Habari.  The
Happy Cog stuff for 2.4 (expected: any. day. now.) should supplant it
entirely.

Yeah, that's a shame that shuttle is DOA. That was looking sexy hot too! 
Just because he went to Habari doesn't mean it should be DOA.. He/They 
should just finish what was started for WP and implement it... :P

Khaled is working on Habari, yes, as is Michael.  They carry a fairly
sizable grudge against the Automattic folks, although I don't think
I've ever seen the full story from their side and the Auto folks have
been mum as well.

Bad blood is often best left untouched.

Am I missing something or are there no filters for the kses allowed tags?
WPMU has "edit_allowedposttags" and "edit_allowedtags", but normal WordPress
doesn't.

Someone asked on #wordpress how to modify the allowed tags for commenters
and I couldn't find a way, but hopefully there's just something I'm missing.

Erm, isn't Shuttle order than dirt and the inspiration for the current admin
interface?

And this is kinda null and void anyway as 2.4 is the omfg-new-interface
edition which from what I hear, is already significantly on it's way to
being working.

The array of allowed tags and attributes is assigned as a global in
wp-includes/kses.php. All a plugin needs to do is alter that variable
after it is defined.

It has come to the attention of the WordPress support forums that one
of the plugins listed on the plugins page at wordpress.org has
violated the terms of being listed there.

Specifically, this plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mailing-list/

Is not actually available there. If you examine the plugin's code
itself, you'll see it's little more than an advertisement pointing to
the actual plugin at http://tribulant.com/ , where it is commercially
available. It is also *not* GPL, which is the main requirement for
being listed at wordpress.org.

This amounts to spamming of the plugins list, basically. The plugin
needs to be delisted, however I'm uncertain who the correct contact
is... who should this type of thing be emailed to for future cases?

Forum discussion on the topic can be found here:

Thanks for pointing this out.  I've temporarily suspended the plugin  
and have contacted the author asking for clarification on his  
licensing and intent to host the full plugin in the SVN repo.

Oh, right, right.

Still though, it'd seem more WordPress-like if it was filterable. It'd be
much cleaner IMO than global'ing it inside a function and such.

There's a reason no one talks about Shuttle ;-)

Khaled tried quite hard to get Shuttle in there before he left, but it
didn't work out... at least that's one side of the story.

/back to the graveyard with this zombie topic.

Actually, it could be a lot less involved than this, if nothing else  
in the spirit of making it happen easily/fast, though some could argue  
about increased memory requirements.

EG:
- in /wp-admin/includes/templates.php
cat_rows() echos $output (based on looping on $categories, from  
get_categories()), or returns false.
Returning $categories after the print, on success, would be enough,  
when coupled with the following.

- in /wp-admin/categories.php
Instead of just calling cat_rows(), all we'd have to do is add  
$our_var = cat_rows().
Then the print happens, and anyone wanting to extend the functionality  
could access $our_var.
Of course, doing it this way would mean one could only use $our_var  
after the listing is echoed, but it'd already be more flexible than  
now, and the same logic seems to be viable for all of the *_rows  
convenience functions I've seen in the admin.

I agree that Shuttle is tres-sexy, but it was started before 2.0 was 
released and I think was more an aesthetic refresh than meant to address 
underlying assumptions in our interface.

The upcoming design is based on a great deal of user testing and 
research and in my opinion gets to the core of what WordPress is while 
providing a flexible base for us to grow in the years to come. It should 
start hitting trunk relatively soon (knock on wood) and we can chat 
about it more then.

Subject: [wp-hackers] filters with multiple parameters?
Message-ID: <CEDF7634-8036-487A-8E10-526934BF4D31@striderweb.com>

I've been beating my head against this, and would appreciate an assist:

I'm trying to use add_filter, but the hook in question has multiple  
parameters passed and I can't figure out how to access the second  
parameter.  Example code:

add_filter( 'bloginfo', 'my_bloginfo_filter' );

function my_bloginfo_filter ( $output = '', $show = '' ) {
	switch( $show ) {
		case 'version' :
			if ( function_exists( 'mb_get_bloginfo' ) ) {
				$output .= 'Hello World';
			}
			break;
	}
	return $output;
}

This doesn't work because in my function, $show is always empty,  
though $output comes through just fine.  I've tried it as an array --  
no luck: it just splits the $output string into a letter-by-letter  
array.

The hook itself (in core) looks like this:

$output = apply_filters('bloginfo', $output, $show);

How do I get $show in my filter function?

TIA
Stephen

You have to specify the number of arguments.  See
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API#Hook_to_WordPress

So it would look like add_filter( 'bloginfo', 'my_bloginfo_filter' , 10, 2);

On the one hand, we *can* look at the source URL provided in a *back,
compare it to our local blog URL and see if the hostnames match. But on
the other hand, this does not guarantee that the ping actually came from
an internal post. There's nothing to stop a Bad Guy from flooding your
blog with faked pings that claim to be from your own posts.

If you whitelist pings that appear to be from your own blog without
doing other checks (outside of the pingback/trackback specifications),
you'll open yourself up for a sort of DoS attack. Really, the only way
to know if a ping is really local is if you can determine the IP number
your host uses for outgoing traffic. Which is not necessarily the same
IP that DNS gives for your blog's hostname. And there's no consistent
way to determine it in an automated fashion, due to the vast differences
in operating systems and hosting setups in use out in the wild.

Even if you set up some sort of self-ping verification process to try to
capture the IP, in many hosting setups there's no guarantee that the IP
wouldn't change at a future time. In fact, there may be a different
outgoing IP number on a request-by-request basis (multi-homed networks).

If you want to try to define what a "local" ping is, I think it needs to
be done in a separate plugin that can examine it before Akismet does,
and bypass Akismet as needed. The problem is that this theoretical
plugin isn't necessarily going to be generic enough to cover all
possible hosting scenarios.

Just curious though, isn't the current login/register background imagery 
from the original Shuttle design? I could have sworn it was? If that's 
the case, is that background imagery going to be changing as well as the 
admin interface imagery?

That's overkill though.....

1) What would someone benefit by spammingy our blog with links to itself?

2) Define it to be "local" and valid

a) the pinging post's uri is ^%YOUR_BLOG_URI%.+$

b) pinging post's contents contain a link to yours.

c) pinged post does not already contain link from pinging post.

Wouldn't that do it?

Or, a one-click way: define a new function that directly adds an internal
pingback - it can only be accessed from code, therefore pingback is
guaranteed to be local.

e.g. in the pingback-sending code, do a check like this:

if (strstr($blog_url, $pingeduri))

add_guaranteed_pingback($posturi, $pingbacktext);

Then send it on its merry way....

The current  WordPress admin theme is "shuttle-inspired"

As for your  second question.... I think the answer would be wait and see.

Try this instead:

add_filter( 'bloginfo', 'my_bloginfo_filter', 10, 2 );

The definition for add_filter actually looks like this:

function add_filter($tag, $function_to_add, $priority = 10,
$accepted_args = 1) {

So when you use more than 1 argument, you need to specify how many. :)

I'd just like to point out that the more stuff that becomes "filterable" the
worse WP's performance gets............

Just keep that in mind ;-)

Seems like a heck of a long way to go when simply not writing posts
that look like spam makes more sense. ;-)

Seriously, as was pointed out before, if you disable Akismet, then
it's not working at all. So it can't flag anything as spam then. If
this is happening even when Akismet is disabled, then you need to look
elsewhere for the problem. Generally speaking, I've not had Akismet
flag any of my self-pingbacks as spam, but clearly it could happen.
However, I'm not convinced that it's happening enough to warrant this
kind of code change. Are we *certain* that it's Akismet doing it? I
don't like the idea of adding a possible way for pingbacks or anything
else to bypass the spam filters unless we're absolutely certain that
it's necessary.

I would be more receptive to this notion. Pingbacks that are
processing to self will be recognizable by the blog URL being in the
pinged url. Then a pingback can be added directly without the need to
do the http request work.

It's influenced, I believe, but not the actual login screen from Shuttle.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Checking Own Pingbacks - Intended Behavior?

I only experienced it once ... but it shouldn't *ever* happen - that's the
sign of good programming :)

(FYI, the "contents" of the pingback was "which we _previously covered_ last
month" (underscore is link) - hardly "spammy" and quite common... and i've
done that before without any problems - and after)

AT any rate, the second solution is easiest and wouldn't take more than a
couple of lines to get going. I don't have time right now (have to leave the
state in a couple of hours), but I'll look into it when I get back if
necessary...

More troubling to me is the fix-for 2.5 status on that thing........ :P

I don't see this happening though, because even back then when they were 
doing it, there were too many conflicts. And it was also time consuming 
per se, regarding adaption for changes that were going into the core at 
the time... Back then, it was a huge task in itself, and with the many 
changes from 2.0 to 2.4-bleeding, it will only be more of a pain in the 
ass...

Well, I think that it would be quite simple - if it is just the styling that
you want, then take a look at WP Tiger Administration
<http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-tiger-administration/>... Then
adapt it? Or maybe I misunderstood the meaning of Shuttle, does it add new
features as well?

This is the login from Shuttle:

http://www.brokenkode.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/login.jpg

The one we use is from Michael Heilleman that I thought was better but 
didn't make the cut in the final revisions of Shuttle, which were 
primarily done by Khaled.

It would be rather pointless, as a refactoring of the admin is already on
its way, courtesy of Happy Cog. I think it'd be best to treat Shuttle for
what it is -- a dead project with pretty much no future. People have moved
on (some to Habari, even).

 From what I remember though, it's not just one person's doing of these 
images and so forth. It was a team effort back then. Some of the team 
members wanted things done one way, the other part of the team wanted 
things another... Hence for conflicts and bad tastes in mouths, and then 
also resulting in some of those team members leaving the WP community to 
start on their own Habari project....

I don't think Matt or any other developer can just take what's been done 
before (image wise), and run with it. I'm not familiar with Happy Cog, 
nor have I heard of it until just recently... But Shuttle wasn't really 
anything feature special. It was just merely a redesign of the wp-admin 
control panel. A very very sexy redesign that is... oh boy, is it 
getting hot in here, or is it just me... hahaha =P Well, the preview 
images are here of course: http://www.brokenkode.com/shuttle

I know it sucks, because I was really gun-ho for Shuttle myself. I even 
offered to help the best I can with "it". But, like others said on here, 
it's best to just let a dead project alone... *Goes back to mourning 
again * ...

Message-ID: <4681c7d40711191318v47de37b6r98a7bfe1be656dd0@mail.gmail.com>

Can someone *please* tell me what is wrong with this query!? I've been
bouncing my head off the walls trying to get it to work right, but to no
avail.

Original query:
SELECT comment_post_id FROM wp_comments
   WHERE comment_approved = '1'
ORDER BY comment_date DESC

That works just fine. But the minute I try to get distinct comment_post_id,
the sorting stops working:

SELECT DISTINCT comment_post_id FROM wp_comments
   WHERE comment_approved = '1'
ORDER BY comment_date DESC

It filters comment_post_id just fine (only one comment per post) but my
results are no longer ordered correctly!

Using GROUP BY instead of distinct gives me the same un-ordered output.

Any advice would be mighty appreciated.

Nope, not working....

Expected result:

493
501
229
485
....

Actual result:
501
502
500
491
....

That's the same result I get w/ the original SELECT DISTINCT ... GROUP BY
query in my OP.

I'm not sure if it's available in (your version of) MySQL, but in  
other RDBMS such as Postgres, you use "DISTINCT ON" instead of just  
"DISTINCT".

I'm using the latest MySQL 5.1 build, and it's not there... :-(
There's a reason they say PostgreSQL is a better MySQL than MySQL :P

I think the problem is that stupid MySQL is insisting on doing the GROUP BY
or DISTINCT first, *then* doing the sort... (and I can't stick the GROUP BY
after the ORDER BY)

Adding comment_date as a queried field should show that it is sorted  
in DESC order. Unless something is really borked... which I suppose  
could be but I don't know why. :)

They're still being sorted by comment_date, but depending on the comments
you have and what posts they're on, you'll possibly be missing comments made
to to the same posts but at a later time.

Basically, it's sorting by date after it takes the unique comment_post_id,
therefore it is not comparing the comment_date for duplicate comment_post_id
comments and so the order is actually wrong for the entire table, but right
for the unique subset... if that makes any sense.

That's an interesting bug with MySQL.

This seems to produce the result wanted:

SELECT comment_post_id
FROM wp_comments
WHERE comment_approved = '1'
GROUP BY comment_post_id
ORDER BY MAX(comment_date) DESC

Best regards,
+ Kimmo

Guru,

Is there any chance you are using MySQL v4.1.21? There was a bug with
queries that used DISTINCT and ORDER BY.

Yeah, I looked a bit more, through the suggestions listed in the doc  
page I pointed you to, but there's not to be done that doesn;t involve  
jumping through a whole bunch of hoops...

Nice! But highly irregular, and definitely don't expect this to be an  
indexed query.
Although the second you start using things like group by, etc, indexes  
usually have to be manually setup (for obvious reasons), so not a big  
loss in practice I'm sure.

But hey, what counts is that you gave Guru what he was looking for,  
and that scores high as a problem solver in my book! ;-)

I got this to work as well (subqueries):

SELECT distinct comment_post_id
FROM
(SELECT comment_post_id FROM wp_comments
WHERE comment_approved = '1'
ORDER BY comment_date DESC) AS TBL

About the same performance as Kimmo's query, give or take 0.001 seconds in
my quick testing (0.047 vs 0.046)

Yeah, that's what I didn't dare suggest given how sub-selects aren't  
always available in MySQL, and wasn't sure if you wanted to distribute  
your code (ie: a plugin or so)

Also, I might be stating the obvious, but you'll gain a lot of  
scalability by just setting a custom index on at least the sub-query.

Very sorry about the staggered posting, but I just  flashed on  
something I think you might wanna consider.

Since you mentioned you're under MySQL 5.x, you could consider setting  
up and indexing (if possible) a pre-sorted view instead of using a  
subselect.

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/views.html

CREATE VIEW whatever_view_name AS
SELECT comment_post_id
FROM wp_comments
WHERE comment_approved = '1'
ORDER BY comment_date DESC;

Again, it's just in the spirit of scalability, and I guess it's not  
any more subject to *breakage* at upgrade time than writing your own  
queries.

'k, I'll shut up if I have another idea now. ;-)

S.

I don't know what I'm talking about, but smart sounding people seem
generally afraid of ENUMs because to change them you have to alter
table, which triggers a table rebuild.

Hope that helps,

I believe Lloyd is correct, and the only places I would use an ENUM field
would be a field where I know for certain that now and down the road it's
always going to be a set number of possible values, such as a true/false
field.

Does anyone know why the get_pages filter wouldn't be filtering on the
Manage->Pages section of the admin panel?  Looking at the code, I can't
figure out why it isn't working.  Is this how it's supposed to work?  I'd
really like to be able to filter that page's results.  My filter is working
elsewhere, just not on that page.

No, don't do that!

I was actually thinking about that; but it's kinda like wtf is the point of
making this one custom query all super-fast when the rest of WP isn't? I've
seen a lot of code there that could benefit from subqueries, views, and
other new MySQL features - but when we're supporting MySQL 3 none of that's
going to happen.

You've got to be kidding me!

I read the first five words then burst out laughing:
"With read-only access to the Wordpress database"...

Once you've got read-only access to a database, how much more vulnerable do
you want?

Yes, the same is true for a lot of computer systems. It's not generally

Yeah, it's not a vulnerability in and of itself.   But, in the event
your site is compromised (cough -- WP exploits --  cough),  these
measures would prevent someone slurping your password hashes and doing
naughty things with them after you've patched whatever hole was
exploited.  If we can add these extra measures cheaply, they can be
handy when cleaning up after an exploit.

Do I sound like smart ? :)
ok, the term_taxonomy is a small one, I guess there is no worry about
table size here.

And given that it is wp_comments we are talking about, performance
can easily be an issue with any site, so that's definitely worth
taking into account.

I was considering a sub-select as well, as was mentioned elsewhere
in this thread, but large temporary tables can also be a problem.
Your idea about using an indexed view sounds good.

On the other hand, it might be worth using a simple to setup solution
first while keeping an eye on the performance.  If the query is not
hit that often, its less than optimal performance might not matter.
I've found that to be the case quite often, and it keeps the manual
WP database maintenance between upgrades to a minimum.

Although, "documenting" your custom queries as views might be a nice
central control for them... :)

Best regards,

Guru,

If I were you, I would also ask why WP need to store md5 hash of the
password in the DB.

I'm not a security weenie, but it seems to me you wouldn't even need an 
exploit.  Unless you're running SSL, the hashed password is sent in the 
clear, so a hacker can get the hashed password and then exploit this cookie 
vulnerability.

My question languished unanswered for a week on the support forums so I'm
taking the liberty of asking it here where the knowledgeable folk live...

I am writing two plugins, one of which is dependant on the other. Both have
option pages in the admin section. I want to show or hide the second
plugin's options page according to a setting selected on the first plugin's
options page.

That much works up to a point. I can use add_action and remove_action to add
or remove the second plugin's options page. 

	if ($_POST['show_other'] === 'true') {
		add_action('admin_menu', 'other_option_menu');
	} else {
		remove_action('admin_menu', 'other_option_menu');
	}

Unfortunately, the menu at the top of the admin screen doesn't seem to
update immediately. For example, if I choose to remove the second plugin's
option page the menu still shows a tab for it -- but if I click that tab I
get an error page.

However, if I click on another option menu tab -- or if I press the button
to update my options a second time -- the menu adjusts itself and stops
showing the second plugin's tab.

Is there any way to get the menu to sort itself out on the first update of
the options? 

Thanks,

Rob

Yeah, you know, after looking at this, I'm wondering what the point of
the double-MD5 is myself.

It could be to prevent somebody from getting the hash in the DB if
they intercepted it over the network (since it's in the clear), but if
somebody intercepted it, then they could just use the cookie
themselves and pretend to be the same person. They don't need to crack
it.

There's little or no risk in sending the actual cookie over
considering it logs you in. The only reason for a double-MD5 would be
to prevent somebody going the other way, much like the article says.

While I don't think that this is necessarily "insecure", it does seem
a bit insane.

-Otto, who would comment on trac except that trac is inaccessible from
my workplace (no route to host).

Seems to me that this is the correct way to log somebody in using a
cookie: Create a separate cookie field in the user DB, which contains
the MD5 hash of the actual (random) cookie sent to the user.

Code would look like this:
1. Generate biggish random string (BRS for short).
2. Set that BRS as the cookie to send to user.
3. Store MD5(BRS) in database as user_cookie.

The existing code for the MD5 of the blog URL and username is fine, no
risk there.

When user sends back the cookie, you do MD5 of it and compare it with
what's in the DB (user_cookie). If they match, you're good.

This eliminates all connection to the actual "password", and a DB
read-only compromise (haha) cannot generate the cookie given info in
the DB. Okay, they can brute force the password if they like, but they
can always do that.

add_action( 'admin_menu' ) or remove_action( 'admin_menu') has to run 
before the admin menu is displayed on the screen for it to have any 
effect. So you probably need to do your POST variable processing 
pretty early during WordPress startup for it to work as desired.

Hope that helps / makes sense,

Is there any reason in particular WP is using MD5 as opposed to a 
stronger algorithm?

Yes, because WordPress still supports PHP 4.2, which doesn't really have
any good support for a stronger algorithm.

But as mentioned in the Trac ticket. MD5 isn't the issue here. The issue
is that we have a guessable cookie, based on read-only database access or
non-ssl network sniffing.

I think Otto gave a nice overview of a possible solution. Which can
optionally be enhanced by linking login cookies to ip-adresses to further
minimize the chances of cookie stealing. (Mark the optional, because it
can have unwanted side-effects in some network setups)

This solution sounds good.

IP Address linking has to be optional plugin material because a large
portion of the WordPress userbase will be in one of those strange network
setups - like the AOL multiple proxy setup where you get a different proxy
for each HTTP request quite often.

I was going to mention salting the password, but it seems that isn't 
necessarily the core problem.

Message-ID: <683871B5-97AB-41CE-8E15-64DE5517ED03@alexking.org>

Hello All--

There are a number of approaches that work today for excluding pages/ 
posts from searches:

1. use a different page type
2. use a custom field
3. set the status to private
4. use an "exclude" list (Search Everything takes this approach I  
believe)

However most of these add a certain amount of overhead, and I think  
the WP development community would benefit from having a single  
standard way of doing this. I'd like to propose the addition of an  
"exclude_from_search" column to the posts table as that standard.

At Crowd Favorite, we need to do this fairly often for our clients.  
When using WP as a CMS, we will generally use pages/posts for certain  
portions of pages - say sidebar or footer content for a specific page/ 
section that the client still wants to be able to edit through the  
web interface (with all the standard formatting applied).

We'd be happy to write up the code and submit it as a patch if it's  
something that would be considered for inclusion in core.

I also wanted to raise this here on the list as I'm sure many of you  
have run into this in your own customization work and may have other  
clever approaches to solving this; or additional requirements for how  
it should work.

I look forward to your ideas and comments.

Cheers,
--Alex

I must admit I have never felt the need to exclude stuff from being
searched... I was mostly thinking the opposite way, ie add more stuff
to be searchable...

Password salting shouldn't be based on a computer generated algorithm  
like in the submitted patch.
Anything generated can ultimately be emulated and cracked.

But if that's deemed acceptable, a quick and backward compatible  
(PHP4+5) salt is as follow: uniqid(microtime(),true).

The *better* (accepted) way is to use a user generated salt string  
instead, like a passphrase in PGP, GPG, etc.

I just had a couple of thoughts on this. What you're looking for is some
place to store extra snippets of content, associated with an existing
page or post, which is not going to be seen by the normal content
rendering or the search function. Using actual pages or posts is
bothersome because you then have to filter those out from the other
convenience functions that are useful for building the site.

So where can we stick this content in the existing system?

1) What about using comments?

Comments store additional content snippets, are already associated with
a page or post, and are not searched by the default WordPress search
function.

All you really need is to hook something into the backend admin
interface that lets you add comments to a page or post.

The downside is that if you actually need *real* comments in the same
place that you're using this technique, you're screwed. Unless you do
something funky to filter out your "special" content comments. But that
shouldn't be as bad as trying to filter pages or posts. Using a custom
comment_moderation setting would probably do the trick?

2) How about attachments? I have to admit, I haven't looked very closely
at the attachment stuff, but AFAIK that should work. I believe that
attachment info is not exposed unless you include specific template tags
for it, and I don't think that they are hit in searches, either?

Again, you'll have to fiddle with the backend to provide a convenient
interface, but I think it's a promising idea.

This is sometimes the case, but there are also situations where you  
simply have a page you don't want searchable or to show up in the  
navigation list.

Disclaimer: the following is just an example, please try to focus on  
the larger concept rather than picking apart the example. :)

If you have a contact form on a page, you might want to redirect the  
user to a different "thank you" page after they submit the form. This  
"thank you" page only makes sense as a response to the form  
submission from the contact page, and you would want to exclude it  
from searches, navigation menus, sitemaps, etc.

What I'm proposing is a standard way for all of these features and  
functions (and plugins, like the sitemaps plugin) to know to exclude  
this page by default.

Cheers,

Are subqueries guaranteed in v4 and up? Or are they dependent on the  
engine used (innodb, etc)?

Also re: the point: I see a lot of people talking about caching on the  
list (luv the subject), but there's a lot to be gained on the  
performance front by just maintaining your own "wordpress-wide-index- 
setting-SQL-script" based on the queries used most often on your site,  
including the ones in plugin/theme code.

That's truly only for people with ultra-high-access sites (or really  
sucky shared hosting ;-), but it can be a night and day difference,  
especially as the content grows. Regardless of your caching policy/ 
tools, the content has to be fetched once (think fast changing  
comments), so the faster that happens, the better off you are. It also  
really helps with crawlers, who go about and query pages that are  
often unlikely to be cached after a while.

Of course, having some fined tune indices bundled with the installer,  
based on the queries the code runs (at least the major ones) and not  
just the primary keys, would be a nice step forward being more  
efficient with our madness right out of the box. ;-)  Let's us be a  
bit more feature/stability minded at the code level, rather than worry  
about performance at every corner. Then again, being attentive at the  
latter level is always an appreciated plus.

Great! Now that you like the idea, let me shoot it down. :)

This approach prevents "staying logged in" on multiple computers. I
login from work and home. I leave my cookie on both, and have no
issues. With this approach, I have to login every time, since the BRS
keeps changing. Can true session ID's solve this?

Longer term answer: Why are we building this logic ourselves anyway?
This seems like it should be a solved problem. Is there no PHP library
that will do this for us?

Have been following this thread and thought I would provide some  
comments. On the client non-blog systems I've put together with  
WordPress many have for example home page 'slot' content items that  
were piped to by a WP Page. I run into similar needs where I really  
didn't want that 'slot' content represented as a real Page from a  
search. Some hacking to the template usually solve the issue. Or  
better putting the 'slot' content into post_meta fields: slot1, slot2.  
etc.

If we are tossing in ideas for WP changes I would like to see the  
possibility of a new content type (Not a Post or a Page) that can be  
used for the instance like the Thank You page example given by Alex.  
Using Attachments are difficult since thy have to be tied to a parent.  
Seems kludgy to me, anyway.

Alternatively, I have put together a plugin that may work for your  
needs. It's not automatic or default.  I use on my client site to  
exclude categories from various actions: is_front, is_search, etc.  
This also works for Pages though only for the is_search action.

You are welcome to try this. I've just test with WP 2.3.1 and seems to  
work. I need to spent some time on it for an official Plugin release.  
Find the plugin here: http://www.codehooligans.com/2007/11/20/simply-exclude-plugin/

The admin interface is probably all wrong. Meaning I collected the  
Categories and Pages into a listing under a plugin admin section. Just  
thiking more about this the better solution for Pages would be a  
checkbox in the sidebar on the Page editor screen. If checked will  
exclude the page from search. Pretty simple logic. Again this works  
for Categories and Pages. Have not entertained using it for Tags. hmm.

I for one don't see the need to add a column to the wp_posts table.  
This screams post_meta if anything. And don't really see this as  
something needed in core. I mean core WP does not even include Pages  
for Searches (at least last time I checked). So why would a Page  
Search exclusion be adding into core.

My thoughts anyway. I know I'm not a big player in the WordPres  
development realm but I do work in WordPress almost exclusively for  
small client sites, mostly non-blogs. So there.

Some administrators would find it to be wholly inappropriate to permit
permanent login, while others would find it absolutely necessary for
them to consider the product usable. Solution? Abstract it, and allow
for either to be implemented. WordPress already does this.

A plugin can totally bypass the login sequence for WordPress, and
replace the logic with something "better" (by whatever standard that's
judged by). I've done this, using my own personal super-favorite login
tracking method (PHP sessions), and it works great. No more secrets in
the cookie, problem solved -- for me, anyway; sessions time out, so
permanent logins are a no-go. ;)

Some of us asked a question that leads down a very similar path[1]. Be
sure and let us know if you find an already-existing solution.

Message-ID: <4743B232.6050409@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

Not sure if this is the place or not, but there's a bug with 
WordPress.com. If you log in to WordPress.com and allow cookies from 
*.wordpress.com but block cookies from other domains, then visit a 
domain hosted on wordpress.com, you end up in a circular redirect.

I'm guessing it's something to do with logins. Not sure exactly, but I 
know I get this problem every time I hit somebody's site that's hosted 
on wp.com.

How are your options being updated? By your own code, or by options.php? 
If it's by options.php then your browser is redirected back to the 
options page and the options are saved simultaneously. So you might 
arrive back before the options have updated.

Otherwise, you could hook your update_options() code into the action 
'init' so it runs ahead of everything else. Then by the time the rest of 
your plugin code runs, your options should have updated already.

Cheers - Callum.

Actually, my problem is with the PHP.
MySQL is very finely-tuned on my server, and has never given me any problems
under load - it's PHP that balks when I get slashdotted.

But at any rate, I think it's *always* important to keep Performance in
mind, because it doesn't require *not* doing or adding or changing any
features - it just requires that you do them in a certain way, and pay
attention to the stuff that's going on.

For instance, instead of just caching SQL results, it would be a ten-fold
performance boost to cache the results of some of the larger FOR loops in
the code....

Logically speaking, MySQL is compiled/native code, PHP isn't - we really
need to give PHP performance attention to; not just MySQL.

just my 2 cents.

Unfortunately not.

There are libraries available in other languages, but MD5 has been the
"standard" in PHP-based web-apps for too long.

I find myself linking, once again, to Jeff Atwood's excellent article:
http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000953.html

This section jumps out at me in the current context:
*********
*Do not invent your own "clever" password storage scheme*. I know, you're
smart, and you grok this crypto stuff. But through this door lies madness--
and abominations like LMHash <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LM_hash> that
have ongoing, worldwide security ramifications we're still dealing with
today. Take advantage of whatever password storage tools your framework
provides, as they're likely to be a heck of a lot better tested and more
battle-proven than any crazy scheme you and your team can come up with on
your own. Security vulnerabilities, unlike functionality bugs in your
application, run deep and silent. They can lay dormant for years.
********


At any rate, my REALLY simple answer to the whole "having passwords in the
db means crackers can fake cookies" problem:
Add a second SALT column to your database. Make password hashes
twice-salted; therefore effectively:
1) Rendering all existing hashes useless
2) Logging out all users
3) Preserving backwards compatibility in that you can use the data you
already have to make the new hash.

Only problem is, it probably doesn't work too well for a published package
like WP.... It's fine for company XYZ running their own software, hosted
in-house, w/ real coders available to make the change on demand; it
addresses all the problems; and it's easy to use.... but it definitely won't
work when you're distributing the code for others to deploy..........

Ermm... just to point out: you would add the second SALT column *after*
you're database has been compromised.

Add some code to the *second* menu that checks if it's supposed to be
disabled. If it is, redirect users to the first.

If that is the case, then let the mass WordPress PHP Extension writing 
commence. It would go a lot quicker if more people worked on it. Anyone 
know C/C++ really well?

There is only such much you can do userland to improve performance, 
without using Opcode caching. If you were to say, take that chunk of FOR 
loop and write it in C/C++, it would be that much faster. However, I 
would advise to keep SQL and database connections in userland as once 
you like compile something, it is extremely difficult to upgrade that 
something, as oppose to just dropping in new files over the old 
uncompiled ones.

It's been a while since I did C++ (all C# for me now!), but I used to be
quite good.

But it's not necessary - that's my problem.

Take a look at my homepage: http://neosmart.net/blog/
It loads in either .1something or .0003something seconds. First is when the
XCache is clear, second is when the cache is available.

Basically, I rewrote my homepage from scratch (it doesn't use any WordPress
functions, objects, libraries, etc. just the database) and it performs
GREAT.

This is proof that PHP isn't really the problem so much as a general
disregard for high-performance coding practice, such as avoiding nested
loops.

But the biggest difference was in caching the output of FOR loops instead of
the SQL that they use.

And it's a big difference.... My old homepage would load in .6-.8 seconds.
You can see a post (for instance,
http://neosmart.net/blog/2007/windows-vista-sp1-rc1-server-2008-nov-ctp-released-to-testers/
)
which loads in ~.3 seconds.

PHP is slow, yes. But it's not *that* slow that I should get 5 req/sec!

What if there were a boolean "searchable" field in each of wp_posts,  
wp_comments, wp_users, and possibly other tables as necessary.

0 = not searchable
1 = searchable

WP could keep its current default search behavior by setting these  
values to the current standards (posts yes, pages no, comments no).  
But with that small amount of metadata available for all content  
types, a good Search Enhancer plugin could do all of:

- Provide a "Searchable?" checkbox in all post, page, and comment  
editing interfaces (granularity)
- Let the admin change the site-wide defaults
- Let the admin batch-edit current settings (e.g. turn all comments  
searchability on or off)

A lot of functionality could be made available to search plugins with  
a few small table modifications and very little change to WP core.

Probably better to contact them directly rather than bugging everyone on

This URL may allow you to contact them, not sure:

Isnt that what the Object cache does?
It caches the output of functions, Granted, quite a lot of the functions which are cached rely on database calls.

What do you have in mind?
The presentation loops can be cached by a caching plugin such as WP-Cache, And function calls can be cached by the object cache.

Some parts of WP can run with 0 SQL Queries once the object cache is enabled.

I figured it was something in WPMU, so someone on the list might know 
something about it. I haven't been able to test it on any WPMU sites as 
I haven't figured out the multi-domain thing. Someone else may be able 
to verify though.

Well, as robust as WordPress is, I would have to say that it is one of 
the trade offs for WordPress being as easy and as powerful as it is. Not 
to mention the large areas of legacy code that probably isn't pretty or 
optimized as well as it could be. Perhaps a grassroots movement could be 
formed to seek out those areas and do something about them. I'm not an 
optimization expert, so I can't really help with such a movement.

If you switched the library over to Zend Framework or CakePHP, you'll 
have similar problems, since you gain the overhead of those frameworks 
and inherit their bottlenecks. Their benefits, much like the WordPress 
library far outweigh the bloat that is taken on.

Like those frameworks, the WordPress bootstrap includes the entire 
library, which for most users means that it must be compiled and then 
executed for each request (except for those users lucky like you that 
have APC or XCache). There is no easy solution, well actually that is 
wrong. The easy solution is output caching, which might be best for most 
people who run a blog whose content does not change often.

To get back on topic, I think that since support MySQL 3.x is dropped, 
the queries can be much more optimized with MySQL 4.0 features. Not 
doing so to support other DBMS does not matter, since WordPress allows 
for complete replacement of mysql. Since the method would require 
replacing queries, it is possible that the replacement won't be that fast.

To summarize:

You either have a solution which gives you have exactly what you want, 
but requires a lot of manual editing without a lot of features or you 
have a lot of features which gives you a wide range of choices, but is 
"bloated".

Message-ID: <000701c82c27$b541e380$0300a8c0@Toshiba>

I just installed the wp-authors plugin, and the number of database queries 
to generate an HTML page went from 23 to 117(!), and the time required 
increased by a full 1/10th second, a 40% increase.

I have 50 users registered on my blog, but only 10 of them are 
authors/editors/admins.  It seems that wp_list_authors() is doing two 
queries per user, even if they cannot write posts.

Is there any way to reduce the number of queries?  At worst case, shouldn't 
it be doing one query to get a list of users, then one query per user to 
count the posts?  That should be 51 extra queries not 94!  Also, if I could 
have it only check users who can actually write posts, that would be 
perfect.

Callum and Jennifer,

I got it to work by hooking into the 'init' action. It took a little playing
around with action priorities too. Until I boosted the priority I could
remove the extra menu but not add it. Anyway it's working now.

I think this idea seems pretty sound for the most part. However,
knowing WP history on new/additional options, I think any manipulation
to this field should be left to plugin territory, similarly to how the
roles/capabilities stuff was added and then Role Manager came along to
let you control those new options.

Just my $0.02.

re: MD5: MD5 has been cracked, that's why people are now uncomfortable  
with it.
I often use sha1 instead <http://ca.php.net/sha1>.
Technically, there's also been rumours it was cracked (collisions),  
but less so.

But hey, we're okay, 'coz we'll have a replacement by 2012. ;-)

re: salt: That's why I think a session id is a better idea, because  
they're new every time the user logs in and expire.
wp_user
-> username (text)
-> password (double_md5, as now, for backward compatibility)
-> session_id (md5/sha1, salted)
-> session_date (for expiry calculation)

So on login, the username and md5_pass are checked, as usual.
If successful, a session_id is generated, added to the user's record  
and in the user's cookie.
Then at each page load, you just check for the session_id, and check  
the expiry.
The salt for the session_id is a central value, defined by the site's  
admin in the main options.
The installer just has to generate a first random  value, and suggest  
the admins change it on a regular basis.
This way, the worst case scenario when the salt is updated for  
maintenance or because of exploit concerns, the only thing that  
happens is that the logged in users get logged out.

Now, if you wanna go the next level up, and actually also check the  
validity of the structure of the session key at each page load (some  
do), you define a reproducible generation algorithm (like  
sha1(sitewide_salt + user_ip + username +  
some_other_data_that_won't_change_in_the_session)), then see if what  
you have in the cookie is in the db and is valid.

Exactly, this gives all plugins and enhancements that *should* deal  
with this sort of data a structured way to do so instead of each  
rolling their own, or requiring a JOIN to the post_meta table or  
separate query.

Now we just need to hear from the core team if they'd consider  
including such a feature... :)

It definitely should be possible to rewrite all that replacing those queries
with just two or three depending on what the plugin does.

Take a look at the database schema, study the code to see what it's trying
to accomplish, and write your own query + result processor to get the job
done. 117 is definitely unacceptable.

Rob,
I'd be interested to see exactly how you did that, or a link to your 
plugin when its ready would be cool.

He beat me to it.  +1 on everything Hacker Scot just said.

For the "Thank You' Page example, we would also need a means for  
arbitrary pages to be excluded from Page Lists.  Yes, again, there's  
the exclude list, but a boolean (exposable vi plugin) would be nice  
here as well.

Maybe our 2-state boolean can be a three-state variable:  
ListsAndSearch|ListsOnly|None

...or am I over-thinking things again?

Message-ID: <33F744F5-EF97-4A69-959D-486814F54706@gmail.com>

I need my template (based on Sandbox) to only give the date of the  
post, not the time. I'm sure it's a simple php hack, but not knowing  
php that well.... and it's net to impossible to search the codex to  
find the code. So I though someone here could help.

Right now:
<span class="entry-date"><abbr class="published" title="<?php the_time 
('Y-m-d\TH:i:sO'); ?>"><?php unset($previousday); printf(__('%1$s  
&#8211; %2$s', 'sandbox'), the_date('', '', '', false), get_the_time 
()) ?></abbr></span>

generates
SEPTEMBER 12, 2007 ? 4:59 PM

I want it to just say
SEPTEMBER 12, 2007

What's the php?

Thanks!

I wrote my own version of the widget/plugin.  I hardcoded an array with the
author IDs to display, then called get_userdata() and get_usernumposts() in
a foreach loop.  That cut the number of queries to 44, still 21 higher than
normal, and the time to 0.020 seconds more than normal.

That's an improvement over the generic plugin, but I was hoping for better.
I'd appreciate it if anyone has any more suggestions.

For the scenarios I've worked on, a boolean would work for pretty much  
all of these situations. Either it's a "normal" page that should show  
in searches, lists, etc. or we usually want to hide it from all of  
these.

Generally I see widgets used for this. Would WYSIWYG text widgets help?

Yes, WYSIWYG widgets would rock! Even more if you could make them appear only on certain categories etc.

Manually picking and having to change a salt often is major pain in the ass
and something the average user won't do.

Better to have it be automated if you ask me.

Look at the changes I made [1], it only uses one query (two if
"show_fullname" is enabled) to do the same thing, but probably the
plugin will fail (if database schema changes) in future versions of WP.

That's not exactly difficult though, :-D

A big red button "I've been hacked!"
Clicky-the-button:
WP adds a new column, randomly generated salt (salt1, salt2, salt3).
WP re-creates password hashes: password_hash = md5(currenthash .
md5(latestsalt))
WP updates login routine from password_hash = md5(password . md5(salt1) to
password_hash = md5( md5(password . md5(salt1) . md5(salt2) )

It's excellent in principle IMHO... but it can quickly get out of hand :-(

Besides the time it takes to perform 4 md5 calculations verses the original
(and if you get hacked again, it would be 8!), it's too hackish for my
liking.

So yeah, it would be great for when Digg gets hacked, krose can just add a
second salt be done with it. But I don't think (even though this was my idea
:lol:) that this would work for a distributed package that we expect people
to install who probably don't know what MD5 is in the first place.......

Obviously the ideal solution would be to use reversible encryption instead
of a MD5 hash. When the db gets hacked, reverse the encryption to obtain
plain-text password, reset the SALT column to new random values, and then
recreate the hash once more.

Which brings me to yet another question:
1) Do you WANT to trust *ALL* the WP users out there to have a REVERSIBLE
hash of user's passwords in the DB? Sure, they can easily modify the current
code to log passwords before hashing them, but that takes some hacking
talent - and hackers have their own code of ethics to adhere to ;)

Seriously though, if you present the password as a reversible encryption,
you'll be giving script kiddies the time of their life. But it DOES solve
the problem.....
2) Are there any *uncracked* encryption libraries for PHP out there?

Wow, that's great!  Thanks!  But how can I change the author's sort order? 
It seems to be ordered by ID.  Can it be sorted by display_name?

Just remove the parts you don't need from the_time();

I think it would be a significant improvement to store each password 
with a randomly generated salt. I think using a random salt based on the 
current microtime would be sufficient.

This would negate md5 rainbow attacks in reversing passwords from the 
database. Plus, it's relatively easy to compute. It's a simple, elegant 
solution.

Are you sure?  That looks like it removes the time from the title attribute.

I haven't tested this d:  but it might be a little closer.  Closer, or have
php errors:

<span class="entry-date"><abbr class="published" title="<?php the_time
('Y-m-d\TH:i:sO'); ?>"><?php unset($previousday); printf(__('%1$s',
'sandbox'), the_date('', '', '', false)) ?></abbr></span>

Using priorities probably would have required 2 actions to be added. One 
early and one late. Anyway, glad you got it sorted, I'd also be curious 
to see your code. Cheers - Callum.

I beg to differ. In this code sample, the_time() is used in the title
of <abbr>. That's a timestamp for hAtom support.

Since nothing is being passed to the_date() and get_the_time(), isn't
this an issue of setting the desired output in Options -> General?

Honestly, I'm surprised WP hasn't done that already... But that does not
address the main issue here (which should NEVER occur if you take care of
your stuff... *assuming* wp doesn't have any exploits) and that is how to
maintain user password integrity after being hacked.

(Oh, and if we're going with a SALT, we had damn-well better not use MD5...)

To be honest, I didn't really look, I just spotted the date format... :)

You're absolutely right, the key is to remove part from the printf(). I 
think you got it spot on.

Although I'm not sure why the date is being passed through __(), unless 
the idea is you can restructure the date and / or remove parts of it 
with a custom language pack. Anyway...

Cheers - Callum.

Re salting passwords after an attack is only viable if you know you've 
been attacked. I'm guessing it wouldn't be used by 99% of WP users. It 
might make an interesting plugin though...

We're not using salts currently, just straight md5s. I believe md5 is 
easier because of the PHP versions being supported, etc. However, a 
uniquely salted md5 is still pretty secure, and would be a major step 
forward from where we are today.

I'd suggest the biggest risk today is not that people hack WordPress 
(ultimately, it's not that big a deal) but that if somebody gets hold of 
your db, they then guess that most of your users use the same password 
for all sites, and proceed to go wreak havoc on users all over the place.

+1 for salting the hashes using md5...

Definitey true.

The only "dangerous" crackers (let's not use hackers to describe bad-guys
now... I mean, we're wp-*HACKERS* for God's sake! :P) are those that hide
their presence.

If it's just a script-kiddie, odds are they just want to put their picture
on your site with a "omg! you has been pwnd!!!!!! lawlz!" message followed
by "dA red-d347h has struck again!!" or something... that's when you know
you've been hacked, but at the same time, odds are this guy isn't too bright
and won't be analyzing the hashes and running them through various analysis
and reverse hash programs.

But when someone wants your users data... they probably won't want to draw
attention to themselves in the first place...

anyway....

I still think that MD5 is the wrong way to go... PHP 4.30+ has support for
sha1(), and older versions can use mhash() to acheive the same result
(though slower).

However, the real cool stuff is in PHP 5.1.2+ with the hash() function which
offers multiple hashing schemes that are just a function call away.


Just my two Fils,

OK, I threw in a sort of the array.  Here's the user-defined function to do 
the comparison:

function wp_widget_authors_cmp($a, $b) {
        $al = strtolower($a->display_name);
        $bl = strtolower($b->display_name);
        if ($al == $bl) {
                return 0;
        }
        return ($al < $bl) ? -1 : 1;
}


And the call to usort just before the foreach ($authors as $author):

usort($authors, "wp_widget_authors_cmp");

Couldnt you just add
ORDER BY display_name
to the SQL Query?

It seems like we have two different discussions going on here.

1. Password: If we were to use salt, we could prevent dictionary
attacks. Great. Fine. Whatever. We get it, but that's not the
vulnerability we're talking about here. Salt wouldn't fix this
problem.

2. Cookies: Why are we using double-MD5 as the cookie? Why are we not
using PHP Sessions instead? This would prevent this problem. Anybody
know?

No.  I tried.  It seems the GROUP BY is doing a sort, so you can't tell it 
to sort via ORDER BY.

It did give me a pretty SQL error message in my sidebar, however.  ;-)

Unless you add a second salt after being hacked ;-)

Did you put the order by after the group by?

Sessions don't allow persistent logins. I don't think the current 
solution is a particularly major vulnerability, although I think it 
would make sense to store a login token and update that every time the 
user logs in. That token is then written to the cookie (as in MediaWiki 
for example).

This raises the question, if somebody writes the code, how does it end 
up in core?

Message-ID: <4681c7d40711211939q629140c1kb0823a9f134b8c0e@mail.gmail.com>

Quick question:
Anyone know of an easy way to drop all columns not part of the original WP
schema from a database? Over the years I've accumulated several columns (by
several I mean around 30-50) that shouldn't be there and wanted to know if
there's an easier way than dropping each column one by one.

Thanks.

http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers/browse_thread/thread/f0a31b05a558d45f/1e1e1b3947442ceb

I had that issue just yesterday (or was it the day before?)

Anyway, solution is to use an aggregate function in the ORDER BY syntax or
use subqueries.

Please don't make me repeat myself[1]. ;)

See above. :p

We could argue ad infinum over usability vs. security. People closer
to the actual installation (read: admins) are better at making that
choice than the package itself. Which isn't to say that there shouldn't
be options or a reasonably secure default -- but write the code first.
Make the options available, and *then* partake of as much bickering
over which should be default and/or in core as you please. :)

If you only want it in English, I think the simplest is:

<span class="entry-date"><abbr class="published" title="<?php  
the_time('Y-m-d\TH:i:sO'); ?>"><?php strtoupper(the_time('F j, Y')); ? 
 ></abbr></span>

Let me know if you want the multi-language version.

+1: feels lie WP powers half the web these days. I think it's a matter  
of due diligence.

I'd venture to say it's because PHP sessions are sometimes disabled by  
the site admin, or historically because PHP did not support them on  
all installs many, many years ago.

On sessions vs. persistent login: PHP sessions don't, ours could.  
Session keys are combined with an expiry date (at least in the  
solution I offered earlier in the thread), the same a cookie is, so  
the same logic applies.

That login token is the same as a session key. The constant update is  
a coder's choice, and more secure by increasing randomization. But can  
still be combined with the expiry policy (update token/cookie at page  
load, but only if not expired).

> end up in core?

Yeah, let me know because I already have it all in a bunch of project  
if needs be (though there's nothing complex beyond the expiry gotchas).

BTW: the human generated salt thing is something I got advised on by  
an Est European PHD totting security expert on a project to help me  
secure it years ago. His argument was quite convincing: "Hey, I wrote  
a perl script that hijacks your sessions in less than twelve minutes.  
Want some help?". Good think he was a white hat. ;-)

It probably isn't what you want to hear but:
1) write an SQL script with all the laters (with cut-n-paste, it's  
actually faster than any GUI tools, confirmation steps and all).
2) OR ultimately: backup, drop the schema (or all), restore

In any case, *trust me*, you don't wanna do it any other way than one  
by one, because any automated mishap would suck really hard.

But the safer one, if you really wanna drop ALL the customs columns is  
#2, and doesn't have to mean more than a few seconds down time (if  
any) if you restore to a new schema without dropping the old one and  
then just change your wp-config to point to the new schema.

I agree that this should move from discussions on how to do it to 
actually doing something.

What Travis Snoozy said is accurate, WordPress has a salt and hashing 
function now (last two functions in pluggable.php) also most of what you 
need is contained in pluggable.php also.

The only thing you would need to do to create a permanent user id, is:

1. Override the wp_get_cookie_login() function since it has to return 
the clear text username and MD5 password. Really, this step is not 
required if you hook into the wp_authenticate action and reference the 
two parameters to get the username and password.

2. wp_setcookie() function needs to be overwritten, since it does the 
double hashing of the password. Using the method [1] described in the 
ticket [2], I would say that it should be this method. Whether or not 
the session id is given is up in the air (

session_set_cookie_params(31536000, COOKIEPATH);
session_start();

), then use the session id in the with the method.

3. wp_clearcookie(), only if you replace USER_COOKIE and PASS_COOKIE 
with something else in the plugin or core.

In which case, it could be entirely possible to use 
session_set_cookie_params and sessions completely instead of setting the 
username and password in the cookie and keep the session for as long as 
the user doesn't sign out or destroy is the visitor isn't signed in (no 
reason to keep session for as long as the cookie.

I say, two such plugins are in order. One which takes the complete 
session based approach for those whose hosts don't suck and the other 
which still uses the cookie approach.

4. In registration.php, wp_insert_user() would have to be used to use 
wp_hash(). However, this step is something entirely different and not 
part of the issue. However, I would rather like it if I could say, use 
MySQL AES instead to encrypt the password, which from what I can see, I 
can't really do (haven't looked at wp_register.php).

I'm not saying Travis is right about salt and hashing, I don't remember 
him talking about that, I'm saying he is correct about being able to 
redefine what WordPress writes in the cookie without playing with core.

Yes, you can use a tool like SQLyog (which I like), compare the schema
to a fresh WP install and have it chuck the extra ones.

Second iteration [1] is finished. I plan to start writing the unit tests 
after this and actually testing the code to make sure it works. And 
moving some of the objects over to a plugin. Also needs object caching 
and polish.

I found that the only thing that snoopy is used for (Magpie RSS feed 
retrieval), can pretty much be replaced with wp_remote_fopen() or the 
API I'm writing. Unless some Plugin uses it, I don't see a need for it. 
The API also fixes another bug [2], or at least it will if it is 
included and all of the references in the core is switched over.

MY PREVIOUS COMMENT

I have been using Wordpress for 3 years now.
I developped my own plugins.
Each time or so, i made an upgrade of Wordpress, i had to review my plugin
code about Admin menues.

The most sofisticated plugin i made is managing events like comments. Under
the Comments menu item i have two new options : Events, Moderate Events. Of
course, on both options, i can edit a particular event.
My plugin was working just fine till 2.2 (with little fixes).
But now i do not find the solution.

I found a bit frustrating that what you see under the admin panels cannot be
'easily' coded for your own needs.
You guys developping the Admin should consider reviewing the different items
of the Admin as if they were ALL add-ons of the Admin. Each major options
(Write, Manage, Comments, ...) would be coded with the same architecture.
This would ease the developpement and maintenance for you and 'sofisticated
plugins' developpers.

Anyway thank you for the great work !

Subject: [wp-hackers] How does code make it into core?
Message-ID: <4745D517.30500@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

Following the discussion on WP login cookies[1], how is code committed 
to core? Is it a case of making an ad-hoc request to someone with commit 
access? Raising a ticket on trac and hoping it gets accepted? Is there a 
more formal process?

I'm in favour of storing WP passwords as salted hashes rather than 
straight md5s. I'm not concerned about my own installations, I can write 
/ install a plugin for those. I believe it's something that should be 
incorporated in core.

However, there's little point bashing out a bunch of code if "the powers 
that be" don't think so. Can anyone confirm how the process works? How 
does code make it into core?

Cheers,


Callum.

Trac is the way to do it. The search feature of trac is also a good 
thing. There's already a ticket and patch for password salting..

Alexander,

It would be great if you could write a Trac ticket and patch for 
wp_list_authors().  Your code is far superior to what's there.

To my experience (since I am on this list, and excluding my 2.3
release-discussion) the code goes into core if the core-devs think it
should or are in a good mood. Unfortunately the opinions of "lower" devs
like plugin-devs don't count too much.

My two cent.

My capricious moods are being tempered by today's dose of tryptophan.
:-) I think a patch that uses phpass would be worth trying.  Any patch
needs to be backward compatible, portable across PHP versions from 4.2
and up, bearably fast, and invisible to users.

Hmm, I'm not sure if this code is for WP core but anyway, I'll open a
ticket with its corresponding patch.

In general, to get me interested in your patch you need:

 1. To have a clearly defined, explained, demonstrable problem or
feature request.
 2. To have tested this patch and provide enough information to allow me
to test it.
 3. To have documented using phpdoc any new functions you are adding.
 4. For all the above to be on trac.

Things that make you patch even more appealing:

 1. A history of good contributions to the community
 2. Constructive response to feedback.

Cheers

Hey westi,

Thanks for the tip, I'll write that up onto the Wiki if that's ok.

So, to confirm, the way code makes it into core is through one of the 
core devs. Is that correct?

Is there a list of core devs somewhere and relevant specialities? Should 
an appeal be made to an individual dev specifically?

I'm keen to find a way of consulting with one or two key people before 
writing a bunch of code. I understand that a patch on trac is the end 
result, my aim is to find out if there's a way to get "soft feedback" 
before going down that route. I'm not expecting firm commitments, just a 
general position on "yes, sounds like a good idea" or "no, doesn't sound 
like a good idea".

Cheers - Callum.

Message-ID: <1fa535a70711221810u43b5f963vd9f705c297d6c2be@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

A plugin of mine references a CSS file which resides in the plugin
directory (wp-content/plugins/myplugin/style.css) but the path is
currently hard-coded as I've found no way to get the directory name of
the plugin. My current code is:

$css = get_bloginfo( 'wpurl' ) . '/' . PLUGINDIR . '/myplugin/style.css' ;

I'd rather not have the "myplugin/" bit hardcoded. Does anyone know of
an elegant way of getting the name of the plugin directory? Or even
the entire path to the plugin?

I've been playing around with dirname(), realpath(), __FILE__ and all
sorts but to no avail. Thanks in advance if anyone is kind enough to
help.

I almost* did this by using __FILE__;  and finding the part of the path that
matches the plugins base directory,  and then tacking the right side of the
rest of the path on to the end of wpurl + the plugins base directory.

*It needs a little tweaking to work on windows installs, as I currently have
it; what with the slashes in opposite land.  But you get the general jist.

basename(dirname(__FILE__))

...should work, returning "foo" for the file 
"wp-content/plugins/foo/foo.php". That only works from within your 
plugin directory, of course, but it should sort you out in most instances.

Hi --

Thought my latest project might be interesting to some people on this  
list:

Virtual Multiblog v2.0:
<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/features/virtual-multiblog/>

WordPress MU has competition!  :)

This is different than MU in that:

1) Each blog acts as a completely separate install -- separate admin,  
users, etc.
2) NO known incompatibilities with any plugins or themes.

I'm proud of how this worked out.  More features in the works!

Have fun.  Go play. :)

This works even better:

PLUGINDIR . '/' . dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__)

plugin_basename() is a standard WordPress function.

This makes the most logical sense, since they have commit access. No, 
I'm not making fun of you. Although, thank god we don't have to depend 
upon Matt to get patches committed. Ryan and Westi (I suppose Peter?) do 
a really good job, if the issue is important enough.

Yeah, I think it is on the about page on wordpress.org. I'm not going to 
look for it, but you should be able to find it.

I usually annoy them by getting on the IRC channel. You can do the same, 
if you want to get direct feedback. I usually don't do that any more 
since I find they usually aren't on when I get home and I can't discuss 
things during work hours. I have to program while I'm at work and they 
frown upon not coding and chatting on IRC.

However, if you want to know whether something is a good idea or not, 
then WP-Hackers is a great place to know how many people hate the idea. 
That way you'll know how many you'll piss off when you ignore them and 
submit the patch anyway (I wouldn't expect to get it through).

Also, where did you do the write up on the process? Can  you give the link?

Since it is already vulnerable if somebody get read-only access, why
not only store plain text password inside database? Vulnerable anyway.
(According to your logic).

Oh, I'm not _denying_ that it's not a bad thing - I was laughing at how this
has been termed a "vulnerability" rather than "WordPress makes it a bit more
difficult to clean up after a hack attack"

Vulnerability: Something that lets you get into or modify the system.
Compare it to this: once root access to your system has been compromised, is
it a *vulnerability* that the cracker can install FTP or SSH?

It's just unwanted behavior, not a vulnerability.

Please correct me if I'm wrong:
The only advantage you gain in using this vs. normal multiple WP installs is
that it works from a single codebase?

I see it in vastly different way.

Initial condition: one gets read-only access to WP database.
Net result: one gets READ-WRITE access to WP database.

I would compare it this way instead: after one gets non-root access to
your system, one can SYSTEMATICALLY elevate to root privileges and
install whatever they like.

Though what I'm angry with is more than just this. Now I see what
security@wordpress.org is. Aliased to Matt, is it? That's the only
logical conclusion I can come up with.

Knowing Jacob on the list, I'd venture to say this was more "Matt is  
so busy, it's a good thing there are others" and nothing else.

Nothing unprofessional about recognizing one's success.

Interesting discussion. I like that Callum is writing down the way to 
get patches into the core. I would have liked to know about it when I 
put some effort in creating two patches which have been on hold for 
roughly a year. Although they are not 'worldchanging' and mere small BC 
compatible enhancements.

This made me less interested in making patches of my changes and sharing 
them on Trac. Maybe it's time to re-think how people can contribute to 
Wordpress? Perhaps a special 'experimental' trunk open to all?

All the best,

grtz

Yeah. Exactly. Thanks.

 From what else I wrote, I figured one would have thought the same. I 
personally have only had Ryan and Westi (and maybe others, my memory 
isn't that good with these types of things, you can ask Matt) submit my 
patches, which to say I have a lot more love for them than for Matt. I'm 
learning to have more love for Matt, but I'll have to get over my 
jealousy first and that is really difficult. At least he isn't evil.

Anyone could have created this account; it's just a free GMail
address, not automattic-hosted. There have been no announcements
on-list affirming the actual instantiation of such a policy. Until
there is confirmation from a respectable non-anonymous, I'm going to
treat it the same as random trolling: ignore it and move on.

Thanks for your confidence, but the alias goes to all core devs, as it 
has for years. As the other thread said, please refrain from personal

Ah, yes -- Callum's first suggestion didn't work. Christine's did.
I made the same (well a different variation of the same) mistake  
myself -- I knew to erase something, but snagged out the wrong one.

Now it works! Great, thanks everyone!

Message-ID: <d48e79300711231734j5feea4edk2ef4bbf309c5f711@mail.gmail.com>

I have made a company web based on the Wordpress, see http://www.sedma.cz/

The problem is, that the client had some subdomains, which had shown a
subpage of his web - e.g. http://plastova-okna.sedma.cz

He wanted to keep this, but i do not know how to do it. I was only
able to do rewrite, that forward (301 / 302) such visitior to the new
address of this page (http://www.sedma.cz/produkty/plastova-okna):

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  ([^.]+)\.sedma\.cz
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !(^www.*)
RewriteRule ^$  http://www.sedma.cz/produkty/%1  [R,L]

RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

# END WordPress

But I am unable to do it without rewriting the addres. I know the page
id, so if you write http://www.sedma.cz/?p=7 , but doing something
like

RewriteRule ^$  ?p=7  [L]

does not work.

i have been looking for plugins, but all subdiomains plugins does not
work with latest version of wordpress, and what's worse - they are
using subdomains for categories, not for pages

Any help would be appreciated

That is the major advantage, yes.  The VUSER constant also allows you  
to make themes and such that (for example) load a different header  
depending on the blog.

I have multiple blogs on my site -- I _love_ the fact that I only  
have to keep one set of files (including plugins) up-to-date.

I intend to add functions that print a) lists of all blogs in the  
system, and b) combined lists of pages.  I've also been very  
interested in the discussion surrounding common user systems for  
different software, as I'm trying to get multiple WP blogs to share  
user tables.

Uh, doesn't MU act as a separate install with admins, users, etc. already?

This isn't actually a WordPress issue, you know...

This is more about server configuration and belongs in the support forums at
wordpress.org

The limitation you speak of (not being able to accomplish this without
rewriting) isn't one you can work around - it's a restriction on the HTTP
protocol - you can't *invisibly* redirect to content on another domain.

Subject: [wp-hackers] A third action for plugins
Message-ID: <D44A0A77-5E8F-48D7-9EFF-758C732B2030@codehooligans.com>

Something similar to an earlier post  on removing extra columns. I've  
noticed the wp_options table  has become quite bloated over the years.  
My site was originally setup on WP 1.5.1 and upgraded ever since. I've  
installed many plugins and also uninstalled many plugins over time.

I've noticed that old plugins leave trails in the wp_options table. At  
one time many plugins would automatically remove any entries in  
wp_option (as well as any specific new tables) upon deactivation. For  
some reason plugin developers have stopped this removal. This was  
great for tossing the plugin but if I just needed to deactivate the  
plugin to perform an upgrade then I would not really want to loose all  
my plugin settings.

So my though was to add a third action (1-Activate, 2-Deactivate) to  
actually remove the plugin's data. This action would be tied to a  
plugin function similar to the deactivate or install action.

Thoughts?

I think that is a good idea. It would provide a mechanism for auto 
plugin uninstall. Any plugin that adds its option would be able to be 
removed.

There are several methods that could be done to achieve this, but the 
best one? That is to be decided. Also the be decided are the patches and 
whether or not the core developers would accept such a patch.

I would err on the side that doesn't allow plugin developers the choice, 
since you should expect them to not take the time to clean up their mess.

This is one of the reasons I think that a general meta-data table[1]
would be helpful.  Each plugin's options could be stored with an
identifier unique to that plugin, making it simple to remove unused
plugin options.

You can actually do that right now by intercepting the "deactivate" call 
and pop-up a js message asking the user whether to remove all of the 
plugin's data from the database or not. Then adding another arg to the 
GET request that would trigger the cleanup function if the user selects 
"OK".

I saw that in an older plugin (sry, don't remember the name) and it 
seems to work good. The only change it needed was to pass along the

I've been developing a WP site in 2.3.1 with a custom theme based on  
Sandbox. It's going well. I've been developing it in my own dev space  
on my own server. It's a two column layout, and I'm using the Sandbox  
theme's way of doing the rough layout -- simply adjusting the numbers  
to change widths + spacing.

I just moved it to the soon-to-be-live site on the clients server.  
Someone else did the WP install -- but it is 2.3.1. I don't know much  
else about their set-up or what they did. So far, the WP install  
looks the same as what I've got. I copied the themes and plug-ins  
directories from my testing server over to the clients' server, and  
activated my theme-in-progress.

In Safari, the two sites look identical. In FireFox (for Mac), the  
site on the clients' server is all messed-up. The content div is  
misbehaving.... as if the CSS is wrong. But it's the _exact_ same CSS  
file.

My brain is confused about this. As I start troubleshooting, I don't  
have a clue as to what would cause such a difference ------

ideas?
thanks,
Jen

I used to add links to the plugin description for stuff like
initializing tables. Now I wonder if we should have an Uninstall
(remove tables/options and then deactivate [and delete?] the plugin)
button beside the Deactivate button, for plugins that are activated
and have registered an uninstall function:

add_action("uninstall-myplugin", 'myplugin_uninstall');

Thats sort of what I was thinking Andy. Something on the plugin admin  
page that that user can trigger. A deactivation is just that  
deactivates the plugin or turns it off. Then another option, possibly  
a new table column, to actually uninstall the plugin thus removing any  
items from wp_options as well as any plugin specific tables. Though I  
realize it's up to the plugin author to actually implement.

Don't really have a suggestion on the mechanics for this. And really I  
know the wp_options table is keyed such that the extra rows don't  
really effect the performance. It just bugs me to have the extra bloat  
in the system.Sort of like there is no uninstall on OS X for  
applications.

I'll just as rather have a function that is triggered and have an button 
or link on the admin. The function I can implement myself to know for 
sure that the user wants me to remove my plugin, instead of implementing 
some checkbox or button in the plugin options page that the user may or 
may not visit or forget about.

I'll also rather have an API or extended API of what is currently that 
tracks the options that are added and removes them automatically, so 
when and if the plugin is removed before the plugin can be uninstalled 
by WordPress when and if that does ever happen. I would rather have a 
system that a plugin author can hook into and allow for uninstalling 
that allows for the plugin to do it, if it still exists, or WordPress 
removes any tables or options.

I would suggest an additional API which allows the plugin developer to 
specify which options should be deleted on uninstall. Which would of 
itself create an option, that will be removed upon uninstall.
> Sort of like there is no uninstall on OS X for applications.

Don't you just like, move them to the trash? I heard that basically what 
you think is an executable is basically not. Hmm. Off topic, but I 
rather like the OS X method. If only all *nix systems were like that.

I don't know who it is either, but let's refrain from meta-attacks, or 
leave it off-list.

Sorry, I haven't looked at your code yet, but how is this different from
doing something like this in wp-config.php...?

> $table_prefix = 'wp_' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '_';

I guess if you wanted to use the same host, but different
subdirectories, you'd run into problems, but something equivalent almost
as simple could be worked out for sure.

Ok, for starters validate your HTML and CSS. Just to be sure.
http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

What actually could have happened (happened to me just a few days ago): 
A plugin function which you use somewhere in your theme throws an error 
that it doesn't throw on your test system and which messes up the HTML. 
Check the PHP error log to confirm that.

What could cause that, apart from differences in the PHP installation or 
configuration: I know some plugins, that not only need to be activated, 
but where you actually need to go to the plugin's settings page and save 
the settings to initialize the plugin's custom database tables. Without 
the tables, any calls to the plugin functions could go wrong.

If that's not it, you really need to give more information than 
"misbehaving ... all messed-up ... wrong". Something more specific or a 
link. ;-)

Johannes

I really don't want to. But given lack of any response to quite some
of security issues, having security@ is not much different from
no such email email at all, thus I can't help thinking that way.

In some sense security related address is equally important for public
announcement, not just being the receiving side. For reference,
see how php-nuke behaves in this area.

Hi guys,

There's must be a way to get the latest version available of WP, 
which doesn't involve parsing content from the main site?

I'm thinking something like... a XML file available at 
http://wordpress.org/download/latest.xml with a structure such as...

<wp_ver>2.5</wp_ver>

What do you guys think?

It would be useful for Wordpress fans to check if their version 
really needs a SVN update.

I'd love to have it implemented, since I always have to check 
what's new using SVN, or read the anouncements blog, or... listen 
to the buzz :)


Thanks for any input.

You can just replace the following code in your wp-config.php

// You can have multiple installations in one database if you give
each a unique prefix
//$table_prefix  = 'wp_';   // Only numbers, letters, and underscores please!
$table_prefix = ereg_replace('^(www\.)', '', $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);
$table_prefix = ereg_replace('\.', '', $table_prefix);
$table_prefix = ereg_replace('\-', '', $table_prefix);
$table_prefix = $table_prefix . '_';

I hosted over 100 wp sites with 1 installation only. No problem at all.

Forget those mass installation script. I can't imagine how you do the
upgrade or add plugin if you have mroe than 100 sites.

Well, how do you go about upgrading all those sites?

Say you're moving to a new version, and it requires accessing upgrade.php to
update the database schema (like upgrading to 2.3)
You still have to run upgrade.php for each site's DB one-by-one.. (unless
you shell-script a wget command for upgrade.php for all subdomains?)

Yes, just make a script to run them all. It will be ok.

Or you can create a html file to put all the upgrade.php link there.
It won't take much time if you got 100 sites.

At first glance, this looks like very unsafe code. It opens the door
to SQL injection attacks via the Host header. Your server may be
configured in a way that protects against it, but your code could be
very insecure on a lot of servers.

This closes the door:

$table_prefix = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9]/', '', $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);

Tweak it for your specific needs, but don't let any dangerous
characters into your table names.

Cheers,
Andy

Hello,

Thanks a lot.

Yes, that's right. If you config your dns as wildcard, you will have
security, so I usually don't allow wildcard in dns.

Ah yes, forgot about that. Exploiting would be as simple as:

$ telnet example.com 80
POST /wordpress/wp-comments-post.php HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: example.com_posts post_content VALUES ('<script>muahahaha</script>') --\r\n
\r\n

Here's my method:
http://www.birdhouse.org/software/wp-mass-upgrade.txt

But that one requires that all installs on the server are svn-managed.  
There are other techniques that don't require svn installs.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Themes Being Unofficially Distributed with Security
	Vulnerabilities - Time for an Official Theme Repository?
Message-ID: <eff2e86c0711252221hd430d18iadee225ca94bcbf@mail.gmail.com>

It has come to my attention that sites are beginning to unofficially
distribute WordPress themes with security vulnerabilities injected into
them. As Derek Punsalan points out, many of these themes are making sites
spam zombies and the re-distributors are purchasing adwords to bait more
people.
http://5thirtyone.com/archives/870

While issues like this will become more common as WordPress continues to
gain popularity, we can do some things to stop sites like this from
some succeeding. One idea comes to mind of an official theme repository. We
already have one for plugins (and it appears successful), why not themes?

Sure, there are already semi-official theme directories, but there is no
current central location to download themes. Having an official theme
directory/repository would help ensure users they're downloading the themes
directly from the author and not a hacker. Obviously this won't completely
stop the issue, but in my mind it should make downloading themes a more safe
experience.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pinging Support for HTTP Request API
Message-ID: <474A6A1B.9050902@santosj.name>

This is in reference to ticket #4779 [2], made some time ago for those 
that have hosts that disable fsockopen and need other ways to GET/POST 
urls in the core. I'm nearing completion of the API and request feedback 
on the now working API.

Unit tests show that the new HTTP Request API works and allows for basic 
SSL transport. This allows for the complete conversion of the core code 
over to the API (no patch for that yet). Building the API was easy, 
polishing it and fixing bugs is what is taking the most time. While 
writing the unit tests is also taking some time, it is part of the 
polish stage and has been extremely helpful in correcting problems in 
the code.

I'm planning on submitting a patch that converts all of the WordPress 
code (admin, importing, includes) that uses fsockopen, curl, and fopen, 
as well as Snoopy over to the new system.

I submitted the unit test code and most recent HTTP API code to get 
feedback on whether it is supported and has any chance of getting into 
the core. If committed, it would fix Tickets #5065 [1] and #4779 [2]. It 
would also provide a way to install plugins that would provide fall 
backs when allow_url_fopen is disabled and fsockopen function is 
disabled. If cURL is installed then a plugin could use that to get and 
post to URLs.

The only tested transport is fsockopen, which should provide support for 
most people, the rest of the four have fallen behind in improvement to 
the fsockopen method and would need to be tested and fixed. cURL 
extension support is not finished and will not be completed until the 
rest are.

Examples for invoking the API:

<?php $body = wp_remote_get_body('http://www.wordpress.org'); ?>

This will automatically be redirected to 'http://wordpress.org' and then 
return the body (fsockopen only, fopen should do this, but untested).

<?php $arrResponse = wp_remote_get('http://www.wordpress.org'); ?>

$arrResponse['body'] gives you the body. $arrResponse['head'] gives you 
the headers in array form.

There are also wp_remote_get_head() which returns an array of the 
headers and wp_remote_get_object(), which retuns the object used to get 
the request. The latter method allows you access to more data, such as 
response information and raw error information (the other methods will 
return WP_Error object).

*Unit Tests:* The unit tests were written for the automattic unit test 
suite, but since no mocks are used for the remote calls, the tests can 
take quite a while to complete, since the results are "live." I had to 
choose this method, because I was more concerned with the live test data 
and how well the API would work, then using mocks which wouldn't give a 
good indication of whether it worked or not.

 From the unit tests, I can say that the FSockopen method works great 
and the API is ready for testing. I'm going to complete the other four 
classes and wrap them in a plugin. The other four will be in a plugin 
and just the fsockopen one will be in the core (if accepted).

So the questions I propose are:

1. Are there any parts anyone is not okay with?
2. For the core devs: does this still stand a chance of being included 
in the core? If not, then what design goals need to be met before it can 
be included?
3. If this was included in the core, would any plugin authors use it 
instead of using fsockopen? Since the API is GPL, it would be completely 
possible for the plugin authors to include it if it doesn't exist.

Any others for me?

I would use it as a plugin author.  I would like to see it in core.
It would provide a valuable tool, like the JS include support and AJAX
hooks introduced with 3.2, which are perhaps the most useful features
WP has added in a very long time, IMHO.  I understand that the other
POV is legitimate too, however.

It doesn't matter what you have in DNS.  The Host: header in the
HTTP request doesn't have to match your DNS information.

Uh, http://themes.wordpress.net/ ? It's not on the .org domain, but from my
understanding, it's semi-official.

What matters is how you configure your web server. If you're using Apache or
IIS and have it set to direct by *exact* host header to a folder of the same
name, you're safe. But if you have a wildcard host (for instance, redirect
all %host%.mydomain.com to wwwroot/%host%/ and if it doesn't match, grab
content from wwwroot/main/) then you're screwed.

You could always do a WXR export, wipe the DB, and re-import the WXR.

http://themes.wordpress.net is where I point people, but it just  
occurred to me that I'd like to see it work more like the plugins  
directory -- svn access, readme files, and all that _and_ notification  
of updates.

Does that retain post ID numbers?
In the past I used to use /archives/post_id as my permalink... wouldn't want
to break compatibility.

Hi all --

RE: the security vulnerability -- I don't think it applies to my  
code, as I replaced all slashes '/' with understroke.  Nonetheless  
I've replaced my "string cleaner" code with the following just to be  
more safe:


	$string = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9_]/', '_', strtolower( $string ) );

Good question, and good suggestion.

So if I were going to make a PHP script to auto-update them all, how  
do I call another file in PHP?  (That is, call it as though a link  
were clicked, not include it.)  Does the fopen() function do this, or  
am I misunderstanding?

(I would like to avoid shell scripts, as this is supposed to be plug  
& play for the lay-user, much like WordPress itself.)

Otherwise I suppose I could auto-produce the HTML file with links,  
but I like the "run a script" solution better, obviously.  :)

The VUSER constant is one difference.  Flexibility in having separate  
custom config files for each blog is another.  (Blogs can all use one  
config, or all different configs, or anywhere in between.)  There are  
times you might want to use different databases, or set some of the  
WordPress CONSTANTS in a wp-config file.

Ultimately I would like to include functions for calling blog lists  
and combined pages lists, (though these would only be workable for  
people using the mb_users.php file).

Thanks for the comments. :)

Uninstalling should _not_ be automatic when simple deactivating a  
plugin!  I might want to re-activate it, and would hate to keep  
losing all my settings.

As some have suggested, it should be a user action -- an "uninstall"  
button, basically.

Also:

You remove the application by tossing it in the trash, but many apps  
keep data and prefs in /Library/Application Support or /Library/ 
Preferences (or the ~/ equivalents).

You are correct, in a sense.  OS X has "packages, which are folders  
that act like clickable executables.  Thus all the various and sundry  
support files for a program can be contained "within" the program.   
Very tidy indeed.

Is there any way to write a plugin or stand alone code to verify a  
theme does not contain these security vulnerabilities?

Andrew.

I put a check box on the admin page and say that checking this will  
uninstall everything when the plugin is deactivated. However, as far  
as I am aware, many users still seem unable to do this

That sound a lot like:  Hey, viruses are a problem.  Can't we just  
write a program to keep them off our computers?  ;)

The easiest way is to include() it via the URI instead of the path.

so include("http://domain.com/sample.php") instead of
include("/path/to/sample.php")

Often not available. Dreamhost, for instance, turnd off that setting in PHP which includes remote files. Also a security risk.

The easiest way is to include() it via the URI instead of the path.

so include("http://domain.com/sample.php") instead of
include("/path/to/sample.php")

For the Theme Marketplace for WordPress.com, Andy and Joseph have been
working on code that will be shared with themes.wordpress.net to
greatly improve the experience.

I'm using Curl on Dreamhost in a bash script to keep working copies in my
sandbox syncronized with my SVN.  (Credit to Ozgreg for showing me how.)  No
special setup required to get Curl running.

Two things. Firstly, it's good to have a way for users to remove saved
plugin data and start from scratch. Tarski (a theme, not a plugin, but
the principle is the same) lets one do that. I also added a 'deleted'
var to the Options class which stores the time the user decided to
delete their data. This means it can be restored within a couple of
hours in case they did it by mistake (my view being that an undo
dialogue is better than an OK/Cancel one which people tend to click
through without thinking).

http://tarski.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/library/classes/options.php

Secondly, plugins can be very untidy and save a bunch of different
options all over the options table, which is probably one of the
reasons people feel the need to clean up the database. Once one starts
providing a lot of options, a better way to do it might be serialising
them and saving them in a single db entry.

Just a thought --

Would it be possible to modify the add_option function (and related)  
so that if a plugin adds a non-serialized Option-A, the function will  
say "this option is being added by Plugin XYZ" and automatically  
serialize it under plugin_XYZ_options[Option-A]?

This could be made backwards compatible by checking if an  
unserialized Option-A exists already, and convert it the first time  
it is called or modified.

Are there any situations we can think of where a plugin option _must  
not be_ serialized?

I like it! Yeah having some sort of trail in the options to know which  
plugin created which row would be very nice. The only thing I can  
think of for not serializing the plugin info is when the plugin uses  
multiple options. Though I can see each of those options being  
serialize-able.

I guess I'm really answering the reply from the previous person. Some  
plugins like cforms for example create many (more than 2) options.  
This is generally better since each form is handled different. In  
other words why load the entire data structure if your site has 10  
forms when you only need one. Then again this structure could be  
cached and not really see a performance issue. head spinning. I need a  
beer!

Good point.  :)  I was thinking that they all made some obvious  
request, or included files not within the theme, so was wondering if  
they could be checked for outside image requests, etc.  Does anybody  
know of examples of these themes?

No, it doesn't, actually.

Plus, all your plugin settings, and _all_ your options would be wiped.
It'd be _too_ clean, now that I come to think of it.

Jen,

I faced a similar situation a few days back.

See whether there are any other Plugins which are enabled in your client
server. Also check whether
a) These Plugins change the template output (or)
b) Throw a JavaScript or PHP error which screws up the HTML output.

Just my two cents.

BTW a link or more description of the error will help us to solve the
problem more quickly.

Hi Jen, you should also check for whitespace after the php end tag "?>"
att the bottom of the plugin file. that usually screws the javascript up
on different browsers.

Message-ID: <fc.0064b8c80662cba40064b8c80662cba4.662cd1a@moderat.se>

Hi,
i have a long time used the flexibility of the phpmailerclass and its easy
function to embed images in mail.

Now that im working och a plugin (christmas e-cards) for wordpress.

the wp_mail function allows you to pass variables to override some
variables through the $headers array;

   function wp_mail( $to, $subject, $message, $headers = '' ) {   

but you cant pass functions like phpmailers: AddEmbeddedImage();

fortunatly the wp_mail function does a:

do_action_ref_array( 'phpmailer_init', array( &$phpmailer ) );

before it sends the mail.

so i hook in:
do_action('phpmailer_init','addimage_mailer');

the function:

function addimage_mailer(&$phpmailer){
$phpmailer->AddEmbeddedImage('C:\path\to\image.jpg', "my-attach",
"vykort.jpg");
}

but it doesnt work, the mail does not have any attachments.

Something wrong?

I think you want add_action instead of do_action here.

To backpedal a bit and vote for something described before, I think
the best solution would be to include an 'uninstall' action seperate
from deactivation that plugin authors can use to designate a complete
removal rather than a temporary de-activation.

If there is a function designated for the 'uninstall' action then when
a user turns off the plugin they get a dialog that pops up and says
something like:

 "This plugin has created options that will not be used if it is
turned off. Would you like to delete these options now? (select 'no'
if you plan to re-activate this plugin in the future)"
     [Yes, uninstall completely]   [No, keep options]

I guess there's a bit of intentional complication of the options
there, but it would avoid the 'ok/cancel' problem as people would have
to read it before choosing a response. It also avoids cluttering up
the plugins interface with something that all existing plugins and a
lot of future plugins are likely to ignore.

Subject: [wp-hackers] SVN question
Message-ID: <002a01c83156$55b605c0$0300a8c0@Toshiba>

Sorry if this is a simple question, but I couldn't find it in the 
documentation...  If a create a directory and use 'svn co' to get the code 
and then modify some files, how can I delete the entire directory when I'm 
done?  Is there an SVN command to do this?  SVN creates hidden directories 
with read-only permissions and I had trouble getting rid of them manually.

Thanks...
Bob

What OS are you using?

I don't understand what you mean by can't delete the directory when
you are done? What commands are you trying to run? Can you provide
step by step what you are trying to do?

OK, we can chalk this up to operator error.  I don't know what I did last 
time, but I just tried it with:

  rm -r -f dirname

and it works; the whole directory is deleted.  (I'm using FreeBSD.)

We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming (which is "A 
Charlie Brown Christmas" right now).

Well, the patch needs to encompass, the following.

*User Interface*

In wp-admin/plugins.php:

1. There needs to be a link or button that says uninstall, which pops up 
a dialog asking if the user would like to uninstall (using Jeremy Clarke 
Text). There are two actions, an Accept, and a Deny.
2. Accept Action: If the user clicks "Yes", then by method of AJAX or 
going to a new URL, the <?php $success = 
apply_filters('{PLUGIN_LOCATION}_uninstall', null); ?>. Follow $success 
explanation (#4).
3. Deny Action: Do nothing.
4. Check $success status, if null, then plugin does not support 
uninstall action and inform the user of that fact. If false, then the 
plugin failed to uninstall completely and inform User of that fact. If 
true, then uninstall succeeded, and inform the user that the uninstall 
was completed.

In wp-includes/plugin.php:

<?php

function register_plugin_uninstall($plugin, $callback) // Not exactly 
sure what the format is exactly.
{
    add_filter(plugin_basename($plugin).'_uninstall', $callback);
}

?>

Then it is completely up to the plugin author to take advantage of the 
feature. This would probably the easiest way to implement the feature. I 
believe that if a plugin author is well informed enough, that they 
should be able to undo whatever they did when this action is called. 
Since the interface will be right in the user's face, it is unlikely 
they will be able to miss it.

 Bonus points (not redeemable for anything of any value) for anyone that 
submits a patch that checks if the plugin has hooked into the uninstall 
and only disable the option if the plugin actually implements the hook.

Neat. I've been advocating this symlink approach for a while now [1];
I'm glad to see someone get it working in production.

The riskiest part of the whole affair is that you have to update the
code in a single place and the manually hit each "virtual" blog's
admin page to get the databases upgraded.

I assume you didn't see the .svn - dirs. And you must delete dirs -r in
case there are still files in the dir.

It's not practical ? you can only verify the resulting (X)HTML is valid
once the PHP is parsed and executed. It's not like you can just
"validate" the PHP files in the theme directory.

Unless I read wrong, isn't that what he figured out?

Yeah, for some stupid reason, SVN flags those files as non-writable. Bzr
doesn't have that problem.

Depends what you mean by "validate".

You could certainly run it through a parser that has a collection of
heuristics for figuring out if a theme seems sketchy - chunks of base64
encoded javascript seem easy enough to automagically find (and a big warning
flag).  Looking for things that look like ad code / hardcoded back links
doesn't seem impossible, either d:

But that's easily gamed by spammers. They're not *that* stupid, you know ;).

I don't think machine-verification would be that productive, to be honest.
And it wouldn't really be that hard for a human to just give the theme files

Is that really feasible? There are a lot of themes out there (I can
envision huge backlogs) and not all of them are as simple as the
default and classic themes.

Anyone could do it, really (at least anyone with reasonable knowledge of
code).

Hell, I'd be willing to help out with that... but I wouldn't really want to
be the only one, in case I got tied up in something else and the repository
just stalled... which is what happened with themes.wordpress.net IIRC.

With any heuristics, it would give a better indication of whether or not 
the Theme should be checked over. There is no point checking themes that 
pose little threat and even those that get through, will be easier to 
ban, than waiting for all of the themes to be tested by users.

The question is who will write this code, where will the code be located 
(probably not fit for core, but that is up to the core devs), and what 
steps will you take to ensure that people know about it?

I have eleventy-billion things on my todo list already,  so adding an
eleventy-billiion-and-oneth seems like a way for this to not get done.
Although it seems like a fun thing to write.

If I was writing it, though (:  I'd probably have a server-based-thing which
accepts a theme,  and spits out some kind of risk rating.

That way, you could have a web interface where you could put
randomInternetTheme.zip into it, to see if it's sketchy;  it could be used
by a central theme repository for keeping an eye on the themes it has;  and
as a thing that a plugin that could send the theme to, for checking before
activating.

Oh!  And the magical rules wouldn't be available for general consumption,
since the service would have 'em.

The question is who will write this code, where will the code be located

I agree 100%
No matter what you do, there'll always be a "easy" workaround to avoiding
machine detection. It can include() code from another URI, rot* text,
etc.... and worst of all, you'll give people a false sense of security, too.

Best is to just have a central repository. "Verified" members of the
community can officially mark a theme clean. Users can rate themes on
quality, and report a theme as dangerous if they feel it warrants further
investigation.


That's far more productive, a lot more bullet-proof, and feels more like the
WordPress way :)

Hi,

I'm not sure I'm in the right place, but I couldn't find a "wp-app
list". So, please forgive me if this topic is not appropriate for the
list.
# I found the "wp-xmlrpc list", but APP and xml-rpc are two different
thing, you know.

Anyway, I've been developing a AtomPub(the Atom Publishing Protocol)
client. And I think I found a few bugs.


   1. Malformed XML error when GETing a "wordpress media" entry.
   2. 404 Not Found error on GETing a category and a collection
document if "WordPress address" and "Blog address" are different.
   3. Entry's published and Edited time stamp is always the same.

The client is not ready for the public just yet, but the alpha version
should be out pretty soon.

Thanks

wp-xmlrpc is probably the best place for the discussion.  The list may
be badly named but it is where the client implementors tend to hang out
and it really if for any of the publishing oriented machine interfaces
to WordPress.

Some of these sound like things that are already logged in trac but
others maybe new.

#1 sounds like definite plugin material -- I'm pretty sure that doesn't have
a place in the core.

As for #2, I'm sure that there's a plugin (maybe not MU compatible) that
appends license information to each post.

One thing that would be a nice feature in WP would be to have multiple
blogs in one blog,
for example if i have a normal blog about a subject,  i go on vacation and
want to have a seperate blog about it on the same WP installation.
This could easy be added with a extra row in the post table. The startpage
shows blogg nr 1 the "/vacation" page shows blogg nr 2 etc etc?

what do you think of this?

This can easily be done already by using categories and excluding a category
from the main Loop.

Since I haven't seen a follow up on the wp-xmlrpc list I'll reply  
here.  And yes, in hindsight that was a rather poor name for the  
list, sorry about that.   It is still a good place for AtomPub  
questions though.

Are these caught by APE (http://www.tbray.org/ape/)?  If not perhaps  
we can get Tim to add them to the list of tests.  Last time I checked  
WordPress passed APE with zero errors a few warnings (4?).

Well, I don't know about that. My client is developed from scratch.

As for the (1), it could caused by my server configuration.
I'm not sure if APE have tested against a server that has
different "WordPress address" from "Blog address".
And, (3) is not protocol error but rather inconvenience or a non-protocol bug.

I'd like to check the trac to see if they are already logged in(as
Peter suggested)
before bring in those people. But I haven't been able to find enough time to
search though this http://trac.wordpress.org/report

Not to toot my own horn (again), but...

Virtual Multiblog v2.0:
<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/features/virtual-multiblog/>

I run my site and main blog off WordPress, and have a secondary blog  
using my system linked above.  Might be overkill for what you want,  
but worth a mention.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible vulnerability with the plugin system
Message-ID: <1fa535a70711301034r351b78d9p7994bb01d8964e5c@mail.gmail.com>

This could probably be described as more of an advisory to plugin
authors to check the security of their plugins, rather than an actual
vulnerability, but let's see what people think. Feedback appreciated.

It seems that any file contained anywhere within the
`wp-content/plugins/` directory can be included (that's include()-ed)
into the wp-admin screen ? with full access to all the WordPress
functions ? just by passing it as the `page` parameter in the wp-admin
URL.

A little background:

A plugin can create it's own admin page with the add_submenu_page()
function [1] (or one of the wrapper functions). The `file` parameter
can accept the path to a PHP file within the `wp-content/plugins/`
directory which will allow the plugin's admin page to be accessed from
a URL such as www.example.com/wp-admin/options.php?page=myplugin/myplugin.php
. If the `function` parameter of add_submenu_page() isn't specified,
the file is simply included [2] after the admin menu.

The problem here is that any file within the `wp-content/plugins/`
directory can be included with this method, irrespective of any
plugin's activation status. So let's say a plugin is made up of
several files for organisational purposes, and the plugin includes one
of these files inside a function:

function delete_something() {
include( 'delete_something.php' );
}

...and inside delete_something.php we have something like:

<?php
delete_option( 'myplugin-option' );
?>

Obviously this is an overly simplified example but you get the idea.
The point is that the contents of delete_something.php can be anything
and it'll successfully be executed right inside WordPress by visiting
www.example.com/wp-admin/options.php?page=myplugin/delete_something.php
whereas the author's intended behaviour is that this file is only
included inside the delete_something() function in the main plugin
file.

Note that if the file is called directly with
www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/myplugin/delete_something.php ,
nothing too bad can happen because any built-in WordPress functions
aren't available. Plus you can put something like:

if ( basename(__FILE__) == basename( $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] ) )
die( 'Please do not load this page directly. Thanks!' );

at the top of the file to protect against direct file access.

So what to do? When writing a plugin, if you use additional files for
organisational purposes, make sure that if any files are called using
this method, that it doesn't do anything unexpected.

Does this class as a vulnerability? Someone with a bit more
imagination than myself might be able to think of an XSS scenario if a
popular plugin is found to be adversly affected by this.

Excuse the longwindedness of this post but I do tend to ramble on :-)

I would think that anything within a subsidiary file should be  
included in a function.  I do this myself -- From the main plugin  
file I include another file and then call the function within that file.

Also, in my multiblog system the config files (with sensitive  
database login info) all start with this:

<?php
if ( !defined('ABSPATH') ) exit();	// sanity check

...so that they can't effectively be called directly, but only from  
within WordPress.

Am I mistaken in believing that this kind of thing is just basic PHP  
security?  (No offense intended in that question, John! :) )

No.

It makes little sense for a plugin to do anything rash simply by
including a file and this is not a design pattern I have seen in the
wild.

You bring up an excellent point: WordPress should not include a file
indicated by a URL query string that has not been specified in an
add_submenu_page call. Please submit a bug report and a patch if you
are prepared to write one.

Cheers,
Andy
