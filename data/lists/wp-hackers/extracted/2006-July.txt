You're still subscribed because we are a loving and caring community

I should asked this months ago, but what's the point of them sharing 
categories? I mean all it does is confuse the user (or at least me) into 
thinking that you can make an item show up as a post and a bookmark or 
something.

What was the thinking behind this?

Hey! 
NO FAIR...

It's case sensitive: ComputerGuru@NeoSmart.net != computerguru@neosmart.net
!= ComputerGuru@neosmart.net
:'(

I use the first from XP/Vista, the second from the web interface, and the
third accidentally in Linux :'(

Any chance of fixing that?

Interesting to note that more hackers use Outlook 12 than 11.... (I'm one

while that may be true for the stats, etc. sendmail handles "addresspart" @
"domainpart" the same way as "AddressPart" @ "DomainPart" - so what's the
difference ?  

It's also worth noting that it's pretty embarrassing that as an MCSP I don't
even know what Outlook 12.x is.

Oh, I know, I'm just whining that my stats were split into two (United we
stand, divided my email addresses fall :D)...

Outlook 12 is from Office 2007. Try it out - it's public beta and it's
awesome.

@Evan:
Sorry about that, thanks for pointing it out. So - why is the first half
case-sensitive anyway? I mean, I don't know a single email protocol that
differentiates between them - under any circumstances.

Just wondering....

The RFCs for SMTP specify that the case of aliases should be preserved, but
not distinguished. Or something like that. The idea is that you can specify
your sending address with any capitalisation you like, and it will be
presented that way to recipients, but it won't matter if senders get it
wrong. It's not actually case sensitive in that the wrong case won't work.

Though I did once have some fun when my company couldn't send mail to a
major client unless we put the alias IN CAPITALS. Severe mail
misconfiguration.....

Exactly.
"preserved, not distinguished"
Meaning that if I send an email to the mailing list, it should forward it
to the users with my name intact the way I "cased" it; but the stats should
not distinguish between one "casing" and the other... or am I reading it
wrong?

In the SMTP RFC (that I just skimmed through) it says that
	In particular, in some hosts the user "smith" is different from the user
"Smith".

But I've never run across that myself in all my years of IT work and
research - do you know what they are referring to? Then again - this RFC is
1982... not exactly up to date.

I'm saying: the RFC agrees with me according to what Les just said, but
even if it didn't, what should be valued more - an RFC that no one knows or
following a non-standard standard that people know and use?

For all intents and purposes aliases aren't case-sensitive, and should
never be treated as such.

This is all handled by sendmail rulesets 0, 5 and 93, 94, 95 according to
rfc specs for sendmail 8.9.3 and above - the spaghetti below, is what's
responsible for turning UserName into username as far as sendmail is
concerned, but preserving UserName for "viewers" or recipients of mail. By
tweaking below, you can configure sendmail to treat UserName differently
than username, but by default it's set to ignore case. R$, R<@> and R$*
during Sparse0 are where it "ignores" case sensitivity while processing, and
then S93 and S94 convert it back to the way the user intended it to be
displayed. By tweaking below it's easy enough to either make UserName a
different entity than username or to force the display of UseName to
username (same goes for domainname and DomainName)

So you're saying that by default it doesn't differentiate, but as a result of tweaking and modifications the WP-Hackers mailing list now differentiates between the two?

not exactly, I'm saying sendmail doesn't know the difference (which is an
entirely different debate, for the sendmail folks), but the mailing list
manager (and likely perl scripts/etc that run them) do notice the
difference, and those who whish to could easily configure sendmail to
recognize things the same way. however, you'd need both ComputerGuru and
computerguru set up as separate email accounts under the latter sendmail
configuration.

So you're saying that by default it doesn't differentiate, but as a result
of tweaking and modifications the WP-Hackers mailing list now differentiates
between the two?

This is all handled by sendmail rulesets 0, 5 and 93, 94, 95 according to
rfc specs for sendmail 8.9.3 and above - the spaghetti below, is what's
responsible for turning UserName into username as far as sendmail is
concerned, but preserving UserName for "viewers" or recipients of mail. By
tweaking below, you can configure sendmail to treat UserName differently
than username, but by default it's set to ignore case. R$, R<@> and R$*
during Sparse0 are where it "ignores" case sensitivity while processing, and
then S93 and S94 convert it back to the way the user intended it to be
displayed. By tweaking below it's easy enough to either make UserName a
different entity than username or to force the display of UseName to
username (same goes for domainname and DomainName)

Exactly.
"preserved, not distinguished"
Meaning that if I send an email to the mailing list, it should forward it to
the users with my name intact the way I "cased" it; but the stats should not
distinguish between one "casing" and the other... or am I reading it wrong?

In the SMTP RFC (that I just skimmed through) it says that
	In particular, in some hosts the user "smith" is different from the
user "Smith".

But I've never run across that myself in all my years of IT work and
research - do you know what they are referring to? Then again - this RFC is
1982... not exactly up to date.

I'm saying: the RFC agrees with me according to what Les just said, but even
if it didn't, what should be valued more - an RFC that no one knows or
following a non-standard standard that people know and use?

For all intents and purposes aliases aren't case-sensitive, and should never
be treated as such.

Would it be possible to add an option to Options | Reading that allows the
end user to switch between displaying full content via RSS even if more
tags are in place or to only show the bit before the more tag?

Once 2.1 goes gold, a lot of people are going to be PO?d when they find
their feeds stop working they way they want them to ? and even worse,
that there is no way to change it back.

There is actually a RFC for HTTP diffs, essentially:

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3229.html

But it's really meant for single resources. I had it on the todo to 
support for our feeds a while back but it's not a terribly high priority 
now.

I don't think the Trac list is intended for direct posting... it's  
more so that people can get notification of changes in Trac... so the  
way that you post to it is by creating or commenting on a ticket in  
Trac.

Aren't their RSS feeds for that?

Message-ID: <006101c69edf$1ab17190$501454b0$@net>

Instead of changing a filter, I want my plugin to replace a core WP function.

I?m not ?deep? into WP plugin writing, so bear with me if this is obvious:



For example, I want to replace the_content() with my own function. If I add my function as a filter, it will take the data the_content returns and work on it.

But I need to replace the_content itself? 

 

Any advice on how I would go about doing that without changing the core WP files (i.e. via a plugin)?

Many thanks,

I thought the brackets style was:

|if ( (condition1) || (condition2) )

? That's certainly what I've seen in most core code and what I've 
adapted to when writing plugins.

Other than that, looks tip-top.

What's the difference? Just set your filter to run last (give it a 
priority of 10) and return whatever you would return if you could 
override the function. That'll achieve exactly the same.

Wait, I forget how the priority ordering works - is a filter with a 
priority of 10 run before or after one with a priority of 1? I don't 
think I've ever had occasion to use priorities.

Does that work?
I mean, the_content() is a function called that will return data... if I
add a hook to this, won't it modify the _data_ that the_content() puts out?

I want to change the data before it even reaches the_content, not the data
that the_content() spits back....

Unless I'm understanding this all wrong.....

the_content grabs the post/page content, then calls do_filter('the_content', 
$content).  so if your plugin is the highest priority, you can 'nuke' the 
'incoming' content, and replace it with anything.

function foo() {
   return 'blah';
}
add_action('the_content', 'foo');

Yes, it's modifying the output but it's essentially as if you've made 
your own the_content() function. You can get a value from the database 
or do whatever you like in foo() and it will be as if it happened in 
the_content().

You'll probably want it running at the lowest priority, so that your 
output isn't modified by other plugins who think it's actually 
the_content - unless you want that to happen, of course.

There's a feed for commits, and you might be able to subscribe to a  
feed for an individual ticket, but I don't know that there's a feed  
option for "EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ON TRAC EVAR," for us all-

going on in e-mail, it just provides a nice single medium for both  
producing and consuming information on WordPress changes, progress,  
direction, discussion, etc.

I know you weren't asking for debate, but I HATE this rule!!!  I prefer a
quick two spaces to PEAR's four, but any number of spaces less than 8 would
be infinitely preferable to the use of Tabs, which are handled
inconsistently between many Linux, Windows and PocketPC apps, not to mention
browsers.  PEAR seems to handle development with spaces across a wide number
of clients without difficulty.  Additionally, with TABs, once you are only
four levels deep, in most standard Windows editors, you are already most of
the way across the page before the code starts.  It makes any complex code
VERY difficult to read.  I don't see why WP requirements should be any
different than PEAR's in this area.

I know this has the whole weight of existing WP code behind it, but it vexes
me.  Half the time I have to highlight a tab character in my
editor-of-the-moment and put it in my clipboard so that I can put the tab
characters in by hitting paste.

That said, I think the document is a very good one that should be referenced
from Hello Dolly.  

The one thing I would change is that I think this topic should specifically
mention the convention for naming functions, variables, and constants.  PEAR
specifies that here: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.naming.php and
it is probably one of the most important areas to cover, since all of that
stuff is case sensitive and is easily overlooked when debugging.

Well, yeah -- depends on what he wants.  If he wants to generate 'content on 
the fly', that is then processed as if it came from the db, he wants it 
highest.  If he wants to nuke all other content processing (note, that 
includes WP-core stuff...) then he wants it lowest.

About a year ago, I picked up on the coding style that you and Ryan  
had settled upon, and submitted a few "massive code cleanup" patches  
that brought older files up to that standard.  Here's the methods I  
used.  I'm not saying they're better than anything else, but it  
seemed to be what you and Ryan were doing on new code you were  
writing, and it seemed clean and readable to me.

1. Tabs instead of spaces for block intents
2. Indent blocks like if, elseif, else, for, foreach, switch, while,  
etc...
3. Use of whitespace around and within said block items:
	bad.	if('something' == $foo){
	good.	if ( 'something' == $foo ) {
4. 'something' == $foo, rather than $foo == 'something'
5. If at all possible, omit curly braces.
	bad.
		if ( 'foo' == $bar ) {
			do_foo();
		} else {
			do_bar();
		}

	good.
		if ( 'foo' == $bar )
			do_foo();
		else
			do_bar();
6. cast to array before foreach
	bad.	foreach ( $foo as $bar ) {
	good.	foreach ( (array) $foo as $bar ) {
7. Spaces between parameters:
	bad.	do_foo('bar1','bar2',false);
	good.	do_foo('bar1', 'bar2', false);
8. Eliminate unnecessary trailing tabs or spaces:
	bad.	do_foo();\t\n
	bad.	do_foo(); \n
	good.	do_foo();\n

This may be too intense for coding guidelines, but it seems to be the  
convergent style.

You're right about that.  The level of detail is a concern.  I thrive on
rules like this, but it also can lead to hours/days of lost time in a
project nit picking over code that executes perfectly.

Re: your list
1, I already voiced my opinion.
5, I lean towards the former because too often the coder does the indenting
wrong and the braces make the code explicit and clear.   

The rest of them I wholeheartedly agree with as best practices (though I
hadn't thought of #6 before).

5. I personally think that all code blocks should be bracketed for the same
reason that Brian mentioned.

6. Doesn't casting break backwards compatibility to PHP4? I'm a little rusty
there, but I had thought that was something that was introduced in PHP5.

Alright, back to lurking now.

I'm interested in knowing where you're having this issue, as I have
been using tabs over spaces for everything for a number of years
without issue (granted, I don't have a PocketPC, but if I did I'm sure
I wouldn't code on it anyways). I haven't found a single application
these days that handles tabs incorrectly, and I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't use tabs.

functions and class names aren't case sensetive. Variables and
constants are, and the WP stance has been lowercase everwhere, I can't
think of a single variable in the WP source off hand that has an
uppercase letter in it. Constants and macros for any project should
always be uppercase, period.

There are no compatibility issues with PHP4. It can cast just as well as
PHP5 :)

To answer an earlier question on this thread: "Priority" is a
misnomer. It's actually "order." Lower-numbered filters/actions go
first.

To clarify something said earlier about the_content(), which is a
template tag: the_content() calls get_the_content(),
apply_filters('the_content', $content) and then echo; it has no return
value. get_the_content() returns a string from the global variable
$post with no filters applied.

You can modify the $post variable all you like, but there are not any
logical hooks in place for that because that variable is set by
the_post() which is a sacred template tag used in the most religious
way by devout theme designers. Ain't no hooks for that.

If you look deep into query.php you'll find a filter called the_posts.
This is where you'll find the juiciest, most freshly-squeezed posts
just after they've been plucked from the db. If you use this filter,
please check context very thoroughly before distributing your code.
You probably don't want to affect EVERY query, such as for secondary
loops used by plugins and widgets.

Cheers,
Andy

Why not just use a text editor that lets you change the width of tabs? I 
use SciTE, and my indentation settings are:

Indent width: 4
Tab width: 4
Use tabs: yes

Tabs are just so much more flexible for this reason - I like my tabs to 
display 4 spaces wide, but others might like them 2 spaces wide or even 
8 spaces wide. Using spaces forces us into one width whereas tabs allow 
every developer to choose their own width whilst retaining compatibility.

[comments from someone i.e., me, who hasn't written a line of WP code
yet! so ignore!]

I agree, plus re-indenting within lines is a bit easier with tabs. Of
course there's the old JWZ page extolling the virtues of spaces over tabs.

Unrelated: thanks to all those who responded to my initial post. I am in
the process of getting my svn client side going.

While we're at it: I've always taken $variables_with_underscores to be 
the standard rather than $camelCase or $PascalCase variables, but I 
realise that's never been made explicit. Can we add that?

This is a religious thing for some folks.  I prefer spaces myself, but

tabs is here to stay. :-)

I'm bad about using the whitespace after the opening paren and before 
the closing paren, so there is quite a bit of code that lacks that 
padding.  Bad Ryan.

Right, to avoid accidentally doing an assignment.

For my personal code, I prefer to keep the curly braces.  But, most WP 
code omits them so we might as well make it official.  Also, in 
templates we tend to use the colon/endif style, especially when we're 
jumping in and out of <?php tags a lot.

You bet.


Maybe we need a style guide and a best practices guide.  Best practices 
such as use js_escape() when putting arbitrary data in an onclick.

Yes, I shouldn't have said "all that stuff" since I mentioned functions.
Even so, since functions are not case sensitive it just means that the
author could be inconsistent without the punishment of code errors.


RD>>I can't think of a single variable in the WP source off hand that

RD>Touch?. With the exception of *ID, I can't think of anything (* waits

Now, if I couldn't find anywhere that the standard was broken in the WP
code, it would only be stronger that it is a standard that SHOULD be
followed in future code and thus noted on the Coding Styles page.

But if you do want examples of where it is not followed, here are the
first few that I've found:
wp-admin\admin-functions.php
startPos
endPos

wp-admin\cat-js.php
ajaxCat
moveIt
catString
fixedExplode
currentElement

wp-admin\options-permalink.php
allElements
inputColl

Plugins have them too...
buttonsnap.php
function TinyMCE_buttonsnap_parseAttributes(attribute_string) {
   var attributeName = "";
   var attributeValue = "";
   var withInName;
   var withInValue;
   var attributes = new Array();
   var whiteSpaceRegExp = new RegExp('^[ \n\r\t]+', 'g');
   var titleText = tinyMCE.getLang('lang_buttonsnap_more');
   var titleTextPage = tinyMCE.getLang('lang_buttonsnap_page');


The primary warring standard seems to be what Mr. Miller called
camelCase: first letter lowercase, subsequent words proper case. 

There is another standard in the code of underscores between all words
and the some_ID variables follow yet another standard...

If you really want to throw the coder for a loop, just ask them what to
do with TinyMCE related functions and variables!

Anyway, I think it is worth mentioning how variables should be handled.

For your edification, I'll get back to you on the tabs in editors.  I've
got kids wanting bedtime stories ATM.

RE: spaces around crap

Hmm, I've always coded as the PHP manual dictates, probably because 
that's how I learned PHP.

if ($foo == 'bar') {

But I do omit { and } when possible.

And the "'bar' == $foo" is a good idea. I don't know how many times I've 
accidentally put one = in there and confused the hell outta myself 
trying to figure out what went wrong. lol

Lol Yeah - it all goes back to how you were first taught - and how much
Fortran77 you did...
I concede this has no chance of changing.  
I even said, it's got the much of weight of the WP code base going
against it.

Text searching for "} else {"  and hex searching for "65 6C 73 65 0A"
reveals that you're probably right on that.  But there are a number both
ways.  As long as they are indented consistently, the second way doesn't
bother me.  It's just too easy to have the wrong indentation.

Not yet, but there's talk of case-sensitivity in PHP6. PHP5 is already
case-*aware* where PHP4 wasn't -- i.e., the magic __FUNCTION__
constant used to always return in lowercase, now it returns in the
case the function was declared.

It doesn't matter to WP just yet, and maybe never will, but
class/function/method case-sensitivity might as well be a guideline:
consistency is good. That it's also safer is an added bonus.

Nice example use of PHP syntax being incorrectly applied to Javascript.

A discussion on coding syntax isn't going to be constructive.  Unless 
someone has a correction to make in the syntax docs, ("You forgot a 
brace there.") then let's just say that those guidelines that are 
written reflect what we are already using, and then continue in that 
direction.

Hi Mark,
admin_notices hook works. Thank you. How to access the $post global inside
the hooked function? I need to retrieve meta data for the post. But, $post
does not seem accesible. "global $post; print_r($post);" does not print
anything.

Before I was asked for examples of source code inconsistencies, I was
saying was that a mention of a capitalization convention would be useful
in the styles document and would help new comers know how to produce
code that is more consistent with the rest of the WP source.  I still
believe that is true.

Would it be possible to add a filter to the get_pages function?

Something like this:

function &get_pages($args = '') {
...
	$pages = apply_filters('return_page_list', $pages); 	
	return $pages;
}


I want to implement a view restriction plugin, that hides unaccessible 
pages from the wp_page_list call. One could utilize the same functions 
used for the 'the_posts' filter with this extension in order to hide 
restricted pages.

This rule is flat-out wrong. It is 180 degrees backwards. Tabs are 
unreliable across editors, change from one system to the next, do not 
reproduce well when printed, and generally make a mess of code. With 
tabs, code that looks just great in one editor looks hideous as soon as 
the next programmer looks at it, or even the same programmer looks at it 
in a different editor.

In some languages, for instance Java and C, half-indents for line 
continuations are also a problem if you use tabs, though I don't happen 
to know whether or not this applies to PHP.

The problem is not that applications handle tabs incorrectly. It's that 
they handle tabs differently. In practice tab lengths range from 1 to 12 
spaces. Moving from one computer, editor, or printer to another can 
completely change the layout of the code. It's even worse if spaces are 
also used. In a team programming environment, this is a very bad. In a 
large open source project like WordPress with many developers it's hideous.

Because we don't just work on one project and every project has 
different rules for this. Some projects are set up for 2 spaces per tab, 
some for 4, some per 8. A few IDEs let you set per-project preferences 
for this (Eclipse comes to mind) but that's rare, and little known 
nonetheless.

Tabs are one of many practices that work just fine for a single 
programmer working on a single project, but simply do not scale to 
multiple programmer projects.

Elliotte,

the rendering of tabs and print output are performed by an editor and
some application (such as 'enscript', or the editor itself) for
printing, yes? All that is required, it seems to me, is agreement on
what tab width should be. Any decently sophisticated editor should
provide a mechanism for specifying the tab width. I know 'vi' (vim) and
'emacs' do ('vim' and perhaps even 'emacs' provide a way to even specify
within the file what the tabwidth is, though I am not quite happy with
cluttering code with these sort of directives). Being a Unix-head I am
not sure about the constraints on PocketPC etc, but the previous poster
seems to indicate he has no trouble.

I think there are some good arguments in favour of spaces (and also that
variable use of tab width per developer is not really an advantage with
tabs, since code formatted for tabwidth=4 looks horrible at tabwidth=2),
but I also believe there are some advantages to tabs (one example I
mentioned earlier is the ease of reformatting -- which I admit can be
made somewhat moot by a bit of complex editor configuration).

Also, I hope the powers are lenient about use of the following brace style:

    if ( cond )
    {
        ... statements ...
    }

Will stop extending this thread upon being scolded! ;-)

In practice you don't get that. Different apps, different systems do not 
agree about tab width. I am constantly faced with badly formatted code 
that comes through in e-mail, in printouts, and in raw text files due to 
the use of tabs.

Yes, but it's an extra step. On top of that:

1. Not all editors are that sophisticated. People still use NotePad and 
equivalent for quick work.

2. Even a more sophisticated program may have problems with different 
projects with different tab width conventions. Most plain text editors 
I've seen do not support different tab widths for different files.

3. Not everything's an editor. Printers and e-mail programs often do not 
allow you to specify tab widths.

The more different people's code you have to handle the more obvious 
this becomes. Tabs don't scale to multi-person projects.

Tabs have scaled for WordPress for years, not a single person has
complained until this thread has come up, so for now, I'll write you
all off as religious bigots on tabs vs spaces and move on (and I
suggest everyone else do the same).

I realize a lot of people disagree on this, but it's been the rule for 
3+ years now and not really worth discussing.

We can fight all week, but at the end people will still disagree about 
this, baseball, politics, and religion.

I promised myself I wouldn't jump in...  But I'm going with the 'use tabs' 
contingent.

If you are coding on a multi-person project, break down and use a >code< 
editor.  Period.  Any editor worth its weight will allow you to set tab size 
at least globally, if not per project.  And we're not talking plain-text 
editors, we're talking code editors.  When you're getting stuff in email, it 
really should be an attachment -- otherwise plaintext email line-wrap 
destroys code anyway.  In which case, you print from an editor, not your 
email.   Lastly, printing itself is up to the application these days 
(whereas in the old days it might have been up to the printer) -- and since 
we're talking code editors, they apply the same tab sizing to printouts that 
they do to screen.

We're not talking notepad.  Or other 'plain' text editors.  We're talking 
working on a large scale OS project -- all should be using code editors, 
which can understand and set tabbing, and print properly.  Using a code 
editor should be part of the coding rules. ;)

Yes, in the 'old days' of say dos and linux, where 'text' editors grew to 
editing code, tabs were harder to handle across platforms, editors, and 
people.  But I don't know of that being the case for a very, very long time.

The majority of projects I've worked on in the past say 15 years were using 
tabs, 4-spaces as the default.  I knew a few people who, for whatever 
reason, set their editors to 2-space tabs -- and very infrequently needed a 
few lines of indentation cleaned up (and then left alone). :)  But in teams 
both small and large, together or remote, tabs has always been the 
preference of (most) people I've worked with.  4-space-tabs is the best 
balance I've worked with, and I've worked with people who liked 2, 3, 4, and 
8 space tabbing.  4 is enough to always 'see' the indents clearly, yet not 
too much for heavily indented code.

Also, working with tabs allows for quick block-level indent/outdent, which I 
find a key editor feature these days.  Most code editors that work in tab or 
space indent modes should be able to block-shift either one, but I find that 
spaces don't always get shifted properly.

The worst project I've worked on was a three-spaces-indent system.  Never 
worked for me.

It should also be pointed out that tabs reduce the character/byte count in 
heavily-indented code... ;)

Surely the worst possible outcome is going to  be something like this?

$foo = array(
    'foo'      => 'bar';
    'fooble'      => 'bar';
    'baz'      => 'bar';
);

I think I can live with some people not having perfectly aligned code :/

Historically we've used spaces to align variables up, just tabs for 
in-front indents.

WordPress uses the permalink as the GUID, but any unique identifier
would do. A post's GUID should never change.

That it stops every post from being seen as "new" by RSS readers when
the permalink structure changes is the most practical reason why.

Right. We don't change the GUID on published posts even if the slug 
changes.  The code is in wp_insert_post().

Ooohh I see. Where else is GUID used? I suppose the only requirement is 
that the GUID be universally unique. Which means I shouldn't use slugs at 
all because they could be reused on a different blog. I guess some 
combindation of the lyceum installations domain name and the post ID in 
the database would suffice?

Hey guys,

Do you think there's any reason not to include the WordPress import/export
mechanism that is in 2.1 in the 2.0.4 core. I guess the biggest thing would
be that 2.0.4 is supposed to be a bugfix release, not a feature release but
I can make the argument for a WordPress importer being necessary and
critical as soon as possible.

Thoughts?

Message-ID: <d9b01a0607050733hb46c8d6ncdbe827367671083@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'm new-ish to hacking WP, but I'm working on a plugin that needs to
be able to throw a 404. So I'm wondering if a) there's a global
mechanism for showing the default Wordpress error page, and b) how
late I can call it. Basically, is there any point before output starts
where I could run The Loop, check what I need to check, and then
rewind it for the real thing?

Obviously, I could do a simple one-off one within the plugin itself,
but it would be cleaner to tie into WP's one, as specified in the
theme.

Thanks,

Mike

Personally, I HATE the if...endif/while...do/etc. structures.  None of
the text editors/IDEs that I've used gracefully match those structures.
 They'll happily show/highlight matching ()'s and {}'s, but the long
forms confuse the heck out of 'em and make me have to manually hunt down
matching pairs.  I like for the IDEs to do the heavy lifting so that I
don't have to.

YMMV, of course.

If the adjacent releases are only weeks/months apart and the
upgrade  is  trivial, I suppose there is no harm in  keeping
2.0.x as is, without risking the introduction of yet another
bug,  or  even security risks. It's always tempting  to  put
that  strawberry  on  top of the cake, but  the  cake  might
collapse. Half-cooked and releases that are feature-rich are
less appealing than a stable workhorse (or a resource pig).

Just my opinion...

Best wishes,

Roy

I think it would be best to roll it into a plugin. Anyone want to take a

Hi, I've been working on a plugin to allow users to send out a token that
allows a limited number of accesses to a password-protected post and was
wondering if there is a clean way or recommended way to put my password
prompt into a page. On my test setup of WordPress, I put the
get_password_form (or whatever it's called) into the PHP include file for
functions that can be overridden and it works. However, this is not
necessary the best solution IMO as it would require a core file to be
modified for the sake of a plugin. Should I just export this function
through my plugin and make people use it?

Thanks,

Mike

 I'll probably whack at it if no one else does. I could use it so it makes
the most sense.

Hi,

Is there a reason why WordPress source isn't documented with
phpDocumentor (www.phpdoc.org)? Is it simply because no one volunteered
for this tedious effort, nobody asked for it or is it even considered
counter productive?

A multitude of people volunteered, laid out resources, some files were
even completely documented, but Matt pretty much shot it down, and it
seems like everyone lost interest again. The related threads are at
the bottom.

Sortof reminds me of what my soccer coach used to tell us about the
best way to learn the game, playing on the streets (which is why he
claimed there were so many great Brazilian players). It went something
like: "If you want to kill a great player's creativity, stick a coach
next to him."

Um. No. Read again. Nobody said that.

What was said, very clearly, was that a feature was requested,  
approved by the majority of the community, and even mostly  
implemented, but was vetoed by Matt, the lead architect.

You may choose to read other stuff into that if you wish, but it  
wasn't stated.

Which is really bad in my opinion. If you never used this type of documentation
you don't know how useful it is. It's not just generating some HTML pages, the
main advantage is that some coding editors (and i don't mean Notepad) may
use the tags to show the docu when you type the function name or hover about it.

I'm primary programming in C# (.net) and I can't imagine what I would do without
IntelliSense. It's so useful if you see the purpose of the parameter you are
currently writing and I don't want to miss it. 

I don't know which editors support these tags, but I'm pretty sure PhpEdit [1]
and Eclipse do it. Personally I'm using VS.php [2], a plugin which adds PHP support
to Visual Studio which is very comfortable if you normally develop in C#.

With good naming guidelines, you don't even need an extra documentation,
because you can just begin typing. If you look for a function to search for posts 
start writing "post_" and you will get a list like "post_add", "post_list" etc. 
Look at the short description with selecting the post_list function using the arrow 
keys and know all about it instantly. 

This is so much faster than looking at the codex, searching through the .php files
or using Google. I really hope that phpDoc will make it into the WordPress SVN.

  Arne Brachhold

I just tested this on 1.5.2 and it worked a charm.

Aaron, I would change how you check version to just see if the first 
three characters match "1.5" or "2.0".

The final thing that really needs to be done is some cleanup of the 
export XML code that this is based on. I don't think it's terribly 
graceful at ensuring valid XML.

Anyone anal about validation want to take a look at the code? It's 
pretty straightforward, I'd just like another pair of eyes on it.

I too use Zend on the WP code base, and it finds all the functions, etc.
just fine.  Things like right-click on a function and "go to definition"
work great.  I love it.

I'll just post my solution here in case anyone searches the archives.
It turns out (as I expected) that it's fairly simple:

Just filter "the_posts", which gives back an array containing post
information before page-splits and before output has started. If you
return an empty array, you'll force the standard 404 screen.

Two birds with one stone.

Hi

I am writing a PHP guestbook (dubbed "Jeremy's Easy Guestbook" for the
time being) that steals some code and ideas from WordPress.

My guestbook is licensed under the GPL, like WordPress and I was
wondering who owned the copyright for WordPress so I can put a credit
line in the README file as I think that would be required by the GPL.

I realise there are lots of contributors, but is it copyrighted to one
person? Or to Automattic, Inc.?

I would like to include a line such as:
Contains portions of code from WordPress <link>. WordPress is
Copyright (c) by <holder> and is also licensed under the GPL.

To have a look, the project page is at:

Nope. Just leave the copyright bit out or point to wordpress.org.

True. I think the confusion was caused by the implicitly connected
following paragraph:

Sortof reminds me of what my soccer coach used to tell us about the
best way to learn the game, playing on the streets (which is why he
claimed there were so many great Brazilian players). It went something
like: "If you want to kill a great player's creativity, stick a coach
next to him."

I'm sure the original poster knows what was meant, but I personally
wrote it off because it could easily be read at least three ways (four
if you have world cup fever). When the wp-hackers list turns to
metaphor it's likely the point will demand clarification. And we all
know what THAT leads to :)

Dear all,

With interest I read the comments on this forum and others regarding
Chameleon and WP.

First of all, I invite anyone to discuss this topic further to get in
contact with me via www.flipcorpcom/contact/ as I am not always checking
back to the site.

Secondly, please find a response the majority of comments:
1) We are not hiding or intend to hide the fact that WP is the core behind
Chameleon. Chameleon is a marketing name for the plug-ins that Flip Media
has developed and that we sell to our clients. Our sales people are trained
to mention WP and we explain to all of our clients that we took WP and
customized it with additional modules in order to make it relevant to their
needs, e.g. Arabic support, Flash menus, e-commerce and so on. 

2) We are not selling the product as an ASP model, e.g., we only implement
Chameleon for our own clients. No one can buy Chameleon and then re-deploy
or re-use under a commercial agreement in the name of Flip Media.

3) All Chameleon installations are hosted on Flip Media's own servers and
not re-distributed on any other 3rd party servers.

4) We do not require clients to sign any NDA or other contracts or
agreements (as somone mentions incorrectly on this post).

5) Regarding pricing, we do charge a consultancy fee approximately of 25,000
AED (depending on client, market, requirements) which is 6,800 US$ or 5,300
EUR which is a remuneration fee for our efforts of setting up the CMS with
the additional modules that we programmed. I believe that it is fair to do
so (and not breaking any GPL).

6) We are in the process of releasing some of our modules that we developed
to the public - just completing some QA on the same. Anyone who knows us in
the Middle East can confirm that we are one of the key driver of the
interactive industry in the Middle East, not from a commercial point of view
but always providing cutting edge technical and creative solutions to our
clients. We released so much source code, given away sites for free /
charity (check www.flipcorp.com/csr) and will continue to do so.

7) Source code is typically being acknowledged to the original author. Flip
Media do so, publicly, in writing (here!), orally (with our sales staff) and
everywhere. If in any cases we missed something, glitches happened, please
let us know and we will correct. Please understand that we have more than 60
people employed in over 6 locations and 4 countries - at the end of the day
its down to the individual and not easy to control. Again, we will make the
effort and go through code and sites and correct whereever we find mistakes
- and take your input into account. Anyone blaming us and claiming to be
100% perfect in coding, referencing, documenting etc. - please give me a
call or apply for a job @ www.flipcorp.com/jobs - you got it!

I am not sure if I missed any points - if so pls contact me directly.

Finally let me close by thanking for the discussion raised and hopefully
making some of the points clear.

Best regards

Martin Diessner

So let me guess what I'm supposed to read into that: Isn't WordPress 
supposed to be a community project? How can a single person void the whole 
communities opinion? ... or did I get something wrong?


I can't take the "boat"-argument serious. I know multimedia data can 
significantly increase software, but a few lines of documentation shouldn't 
be a space issue in the 21st century.Other arguments sound at least worth 
considering:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004948.html :
> it would have to bemore of a make-the-comments-look-pretty-etc function as

or http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/005083.html 
and 
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/005088.html 
who found the inline doc distracting.



Some of the posts in the above discussion suggested to maintain two versions 
e.g. a commented developer edition and a white space stripped runtime 
edition or Matt's edition and a documented community edition or a separate 
documentation. I don't like this idea, because maintaining two versions is 
an extra overhead and they can easily get out of sync especially if there is 
resistance against one of them.

Whether or not code should be documented should not be a matter of 
discussion. Documentation is an integral part of professional development, 
it's 5% extra work to do the documentation according to phpDocumentor (or 
PHPXref or any other inline documentation tool or your choice) rather than 
doing it according to your own preference and the parser readable syntax is 
still human readable. I also agree with Arne that it replaces at least the 
reference manual. You still need a manual in "plain English" which explains 
the concepts and where to start, but this manual doesn't need to be updated 
as frequently as the reference.

Right. See? Not a claim that Matt has no creativity. Just a claim  
that he actively suppresses it in others. Quite a different  
accusation. ;-)

I'd vote against it going into 2.0.4.  It would be nice if 2.0.4  
could be primarily focused on bugs, to make a nice stable last (or  
perhaps penultimate) release in the 2.0 branch.  Things are already  
being pushed off to 2.2, so 2.1 is within reach.  Plus, 2.1 is going  
to break some plugins, so it'd be nice if there were a few 2.1-only  
features to offset that (WP import/export, spell check, etc).

There are many ways to run Open Source/Free Software projects.  
Wordpress leans towards the "Benevolent dictator" model, whereas  
other projects, such as PHP, for example, with 1000+ committers, lean  
towards the true democracy model. Most other projects fall somewhere  
in the middle. So whether it is "supposed to be a community project"  
is not really the issue. The issue is exactly how this particular  
community project governs itself, which may be somewhat different  
from your expectations, if you've ever been involved in other f/oss  
projects.

While it is certainly possible to automatically strip out  
documentation when a release is made, leading on only one version,  
but two downloadable releases, I tend to agree that even this  
approach is pretty silly. I think many of us are in agreement with  
your assessment, there are essentially two possible approaches.  
First, the one that most of us have taken, which is to quit caring,  
since we've received the veto from the top of the food chain. Second,  
a development fork, is an approach that (I think) two folks have  
taken, and moved off in their own directions. Sure, keeping in sync  
is a pain, but that's what svn is for.

Will do. Not sure why I didn't think of that.

I _was_ pretty disturbed by some of the code. I figured you were just not
feeling well that day or something. :) Sure, I'll fix that up too. I was
trying to avoid taking too many liberties with your code since it worked.

*sigh* It could also mean that by getting anal about the inline
documentation we squelch the natural enthusiasm and abilities of the
programmers and people who are developing wordpress (i.e.
overcoaching). It could also just be a world cup observation. At any
rate, it doesn't seem worth arguing about.

You actually don't have to guess and read anything into anyone's
words-- someone provided links to the discussion in the archive. Read
it for yourself.

As Rich notes-- there are many OS models, WP has Matt as the
Benevolent Dictator for Life (or until he says otherwise). It's
certainly not anything goes, and doing these kind of docs didn't go :)

You actually don't have to guess and read anything into anyone's
words-- someone provided links to the discussion in the archive. Read it for yourself.

As Rich notes-- there are many OS models, WP has Matt as the Benevolent Dictator for Life (or until he says otherwise). It's certainly not anything goes, and doing these kind of docs didn't go :)

Yeah... You could go create a thread about it on WP-Hackers... 

Oh, wait... :p

Background questions:
I've seen auto documentors for Delphi.  Each involved a  manually run process that produced standard documentation that was usually just fluff that people usually ignored.  As a result it fell out of date as the source code evolved.  Someone would refactor a section and the old comments would remain and would slowly float away from their orginal area until a major comment clean up was done on the code.  It sounds like PHPDoc is a more interactive approach - when certain editors are used.  Does PHPDoc somehow mitigate the risk of autocreated comments falling out of date?  How will it handle code that was checked in by people that did not have PHPDoc active?  

Aside from the header (I do like headers btw), how much documentation does the PHPDoc add to the functions' & methods' inner code?  It almost sounds like every line with a php function gets standard text added to it.  I may not have searched hard enough but I could not find a good Before-and-After example on their web page.

Speaking of 2.0.4 and 2.1. trac mentions a June 30th release date for 2.0.4,
and you're suggesting 2.1 is coming soon. Are there any specifics? How close
or far away is 2.0.4? How far away is 2.1? A mere idea of when would be
greatly appreciated.

Also, which plugins will be broken by 2.1?

If it is any indication, in the IRC Meetup yesterday, it was decided that the WP 2.1 bug hunts would occur twice a month for now and that could be adjusted later on as needed...  You could probably use that info to guess at the answer to "Which plugins [will be] broken by 2.1?"

In fact wrong or outdated documentation can be even worse than no 
documentation at all, and since phpDocumentor relies on comments beeing 
properly written by the author, there is a chance that they deviate from the 
actual source. However I see an even bigger risk of deviation with a 
separate documentation on the codex.

> Does PHPDoc somehow mitigate the risk of autocreated comments falling out 
> of date?
phpDocumentor does not autocreate comments. It rather parses manually 
created comments and generates documentation from it. In addition some IDEs 
are phpDocumentor-aware.

BTW: I was thinking of a way to automatically create at least function 
headers with @param definitions. Any ideas?


>  How will it handle code that was checked in by people that did not have

You don't need to have phpDocumentor installed. You just have to create or 
update the specially formatted comments.

> Aside from the header (I do like headers btw), how much documentation does

The main elements to document are files, classes, functions/methods 
(parameters and return values) and variables.

Only function definitions, not the use of a function.

I'm kind of partial to reformatting version numbers as a 4-digit 'MMmm' 
(MAJOR/minor, e.g., '0105', '0200', '0201') format. Even though it's 
unlikely that we'll be dealing with double-digit versions anytime soon, 
it's still a forward-looking way to easily compare versions.

Just a thought.

I still prefer the idea of checking the db version variable, which I
know has changed in every major release so far, and will likely change
in every major release, and I'm sure if we asked, we could get it
bumped to the latest revision for each release even if there were no
DB changes (unlikely as it may be). Of course, the downside of this is
not being able to easily find bugfix releases from this, but for most,
if you need to be that specific, you might as well test the whole
version string.

+1

Mathematically, whole number comparisons are much more logical. I appreciate
the human readbility of 2.0.3, 2.0.4, 2.1-alpha2 but these operators are not
mathematically simpl (even though a substr( get_option('version'), 0, 3) )
is perfectly easy too - it's just more kludgey.

So maybe having an option called version and an option called build would be
better in the future? Of course, this is way off the topic of the WordPress
import/export.

Why not use the same version system as PHP? That would allow
us to use the version_compare function of PHP [1] which even supports
names like "dev" "RC1","RC2" and so on.

if(version_compare($wp_version,'2.0.4','<')===true)) {
  echo "Please upgrade at least to WordPress 2.0.4!";
}

Here's my solution for the Lyceum GUID problem.

   http://source.ibiblio.org/trac/lyceum/changeset/879

Is this effective for WordPress' use of GUID?

Message-ID: <d9b01a0607070642s3b2b5b80u6befd2619196cca4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm a little confused by the behaviour of the generate_rewrite_rule
function. According to the docs
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite>, it's
supposed to create a single "no-frills" rule, but when I var_dump the
returned results of it, it seems I'm still getting around 10 rules,
corresponding to trackbacks, multiple feeds, and attachments. (what
the hell are those?)

I feel icky adding 9 extraneous preg_matches to every pageview... is
this a bug or "by design"?

Without seeing exactly what you are, I need to ask, are you seeing the results of wp-includes\classes.php's function rewrite_rules()?

That returns an array of the rules (8 by default) needed to process all the ways your blog is accessed.  For instance, a special rule is needed when you click on a category, one is needed for links to pages, and etc.  I suppose pieces could be eliminated if, for instance, you didn't have a calendar, but the benifit would be negligable....

If that's not what you're looking at, an example might help...

Context: I'm making a simple plugin to aid in inserting mini-galleries
into posts. I realise that there are lots of other plugins that do
this same basic task, but one of the features I'd like to have is
"click the thumbnail to bring up mid-view in blog template". So if the
post is <http://example.com/blog/2006/07/07/my-post/>, then you could
view one of the pics at
<http://example.com/blog/2006/07/07/my-post/photos/hpim4523/>, and
then click it again to see the massive-sized original.

I know WP2 has some built-in features for attached images and so-on,
but I've got Photon compiled as a Universal now and working with
iPhoto 6, so I'd prefer to use that as the uploading tool.

Whatever. Here's what I've got. (which does work perfectly, it just
generates a boatload of extraneous rules... why would I have a feed
for a single image within a post?)

function wp_quickgal_rewrite_rules($wp_rewrite) {
    global $wp_rewrite;

    // add rewrite tokens
    $photo_tag = '%photoname%';
    $wp_rewrite->add_rewrite_tag($photo_tag, '([^/]+)', 'photoname=');

    $structure = rtrim($wp_rewrite->permalink_structure, '/') .
"/photos/{$photo_tag}/";
    $rules = $wp_rewrite->generate_rewrite_rule($structure);
    $wp_rewrite->rules += $rules;

    //var_dump($wp_rewrite); die();
}

add_filter('generate_rewrite_rules', 'wp_quickgal_rewrite_rules');

If I uncomment the var_dump line and then re-save the rules, the tail
end of the "rules" array looks like this:

    ["articles/([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{1,2})/([0-9]{1,2})/([^/]+)/photos/([^/]+)/trackback/?$"]=>
    string(107)
"index.php?year=$matches[1]&monthnum=$matches[2]&day=$matches[3]&name=$matches[4]&photoname=$matches[5]&tb=1"

    string(119)

    string(49) "index.php?attachment=$matches[1]&feed=$matches[2]"

The suggestions made here
<http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-trac/2006-February/000109.html>
make a lot of sense, but that was several months ago; are there plans
to sane-ify wp_rewrite for 2.1?

Thanks,

Mike

A public URL is, by definition, globally unique. I don't see any 
compelling reason to change what we do, we already indicate not to use 
it as a permalink in the feed.

In Lyceum a blog admin can change their blog's url 'slug' at any time

   http://myslug.example.com

And when they do so, the old slug is up for grabs, therefore introducting 
the potential for GUID collision between blogs. That's why I was wondering 
what WP (and maybe plugins?) use GUIDs for, becaue maybe GUID namespace 
collison between blogs never matters anyway?

Something interesting to note is that WP _does_ use GUID to identify the 
path to files. So if anything other than a GUID is used for files, images 
will not work. Is this valid use of GUID in this case?

I mis-typed above, I meant to say "if anything other than the file's URL 
is used for the GUID of a file (attachment), images will not work"

I always thought of a GUID as more of an abstract thing. I guess I
just think it's a bit weird that whatever slug you initially publish a
piece under is what it is forever. (not that the slug should be
changing anyways, but it's still strange...)

Wordpress already keeps an id field that identifies posts... I would
have thought a good guid would be something more like
"354@mysite.com/myblog/"

Typo (which I'm almost through migrating away from, to Wordpress) uses
a bizarre string of hash-y kind of stuff, like
"urn:uuid:9b114420-9029-43c5-a013-75ec9b27924d"

In this case, the GUID is used for the <atom:id> element, which must
be a valid IRI (URI in Atom 0.3). "354@mysite.com/myblog/" isn't
valid, but both WordPress's URLs and Typo's URNs are. It's easier to
use the URL than to bother with generating a valid URI some other way.
That the slug can change is definitely a problem, though.

That particular scheme also isn't great because post IDs aren't always
preserved when changing publishing systems. IIRC the WordPress
importers discard them in favour of MySQL auto_increment values, for
example.

Mark Pilgrim wrote an article a few years ago on producing Atom IDs
with `tag:` URIs which covers this:

It's worth the read. :)

Is there any UI-specific reason that the "No" button on the nonce  
dialog is a link?  It looks strange with the "Yes" being a form  
button.  Can't we just make a little GET form pointing to the target  
and have that function just as well as a link, or just use CSS to  
format it like a form button?

Mike, Sam, Matt, and others-- thanks for the feedback on this issue. Looks 
like I need to investigate how to create GUIDs that will be both 
persistently unique and within the atom spec.

Hmmm, I've been meaning to log this issue of prioritizing the
trackbacks.  I see it was logged and shot down by Matt:

> Pingback is better: 
> *More contextual 
> *Handles international encoding better 
> *More spam-resistant 
> *Better link text 
> This is too obscure to be a preference, so just going to close. 

The logic I was going to use was "Trackbacks should be done first
because they are added through a deliberate choice."

If this ticket was acted upon, Pingbacks would remain the default and
would be used 99% of the time.  The only exception would be when the
author deliberately chose to redundently add a site referenced in the
article to the Trackback field.

The user would then have a choice of which they desire to use at any
particular site.  If you prefer a pingback at a site, list it in the
article and simply don't add a Trackback.  If you want a trackback, add
one.

Under the current design, if you have a specific desire to have a
trackback added, you have to leave the link out of your article, add the
trackback, publish the article, edit the article and add the link back
to the article... 

Unless there is some reasoning I am not seeing, processing trackbacks
first will only add flexiblity.  It won't depreciate pingbacks in any
fashion...

I actually have a bigger gripe with it: why do we need it?
When you delete a post (mind, a *post*) you get a JS dialog box asking if
you're sure, press ok, and you're done.
Now to delete a *comment* you have to go through an entire charade of links
and buttons. 
If a post doesn?t require a YN page, why should a comment require one?
Nonces can still be used, just put the nonce code before dialog box code
and you're set... unless of course I'm missing something.

Post/Page deletes are done from admin pages and the referer checked,
whereas comment deletions can be done from the moderation emails, with
no referer checks. There was a rather lengthy discussion before the
nonces and the Yes/No screen was added.

I do agree however that the complete lack of styling (in 2.0.3 anyway)
could use some help to fit in with the rest of the UI. I guess I
should go and do a checkout now to see what's changed for 2.1

They do appear nicely styled in trunk.

Ahhh, the good ol' "-hackers" suffix strikes again.

We're using "hackers" in the Eric S. Raymond "extreme coders" sense, NOT
the "l33t hax0r" sense.  Take your script kiddying elsewhere, if you please.

Need botnets? What for? SPAM? DDOS attacks? How about  you search  under
/dev/null/? Please stay there, too.

If the intent is misinterpreted here  (perhaps the OP seeks to develop a
security solution, which is unlikely), I can see what it has to do  with
'cracker', but not  'wp'  or  'hacker'.  Speaking of the  hacker-cracker
confusion:

When will the media finally learn? *sigh* This also reminds me of people
seeking cracked software in css-discuss.

Why bloat the WordPress download? If people want it, they can download 
and install it.

The percentage of users who use WordPress for podcasting is pretty small 
I'd imagine.

Agreed, for example I think the role-manager plugin really should be a
default item.

LOL, fair enough. I just havent seen the discussion about default
plugins raised much in here, so was curious what the thinking was.

heh, Ive been waiting for a couple months for podpress to get talked
about on here, and no luck ;-)

My real goal is to get a wordpress developer to respond to my previous
request to add a hook into the wp-admin/categories.php around the edit
and post sections. Im having to include a custom version of this file in
 podPress to allow categorycasting to work. CategoryCasting allows users
to customize a bunch of feed settings on a per category basis.

Just open a ticket on trac [1] and submit a patch... I don't think
there is any reason not to include such a hook.

I think it would be cool to ship a handful of key plugins with release
versions. By the same token, it would be nice to see some of the
*core* functionality abstracted out into plugins. The rich-text
editor, for example, and the post-page image uploader. Even if they
were enabled-by-default, it would be nice if it was something I could
remove/replace/customize.

Oi, I couldn't disagree more. While I love the plugin, it's like giving 
a 5 year old the keys to a red Ferrari.

Hell, I consider myself pretty experienced with WP and yet I still 
managed to break my blog with that plugin and had to do a bit of hacking 
to fix it.

Role Manager should be left to those who know what they are doing and 
that's probably why it was left outta the core for that exact reason.

I use PGP/GPG in all my outgoing E-mails, but in mailing lists, on-line
forums and newsgroups this contributes to clutter, which is not appreciated
by all (often even frowned upon). I used it briefly in UseNet because I had
an imposter, but otherwise it's gratuitous and spurious.

Guru, how about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_posting ?

Why would you want to favor Trackback over Pingback?  I'm not asking  
that rhetorically, I'd like to know why, when given a resource that  
can accept both Trackbacks and Pingbacks, you would favor Trackback.

I believe the 'traditional' line of thinking is that since trackbacks have to be manually done, they're 'worth more' than PBs (look at the "Popularity Contest" plugin).

I personally disagree, I think TB is actually on the road to dead, but there is some logic behind the demand:

Nevermind the _reason_ why he wants TB over PB; if a user goes through the trouble of adding a TB, WP should honor it instead of sending a PB first.... if you understand what I'm saying... it's like no matter what the users' reason is, they did it anyway, and now it's WP's role to give priority to TB over PB since that's what the user wants......

On a side note,  shouldn't it be possible to get from a comment email  
to the moderation screen for it without jumping through hoops?  
Currently this is only easy if the email has been flagged as  
"moderated." If NOT flagged moderated but the comment  IS  spam, the  
email for it doesn't include a link to any page where one might mark  
it as spam (thus informing Akismet).

We have the options to approve or delete in the moderation email - why
not include a link to "Mark as Spam" as well?

Well said Guru. It should be clear that the issue here is not that WP should use trackbacks instead of pingbacks.  The issue is that trackbacks should be allowed when the author manually declares a trackback is preferred. 

I do agree that pingbacks have a technically better (easier to process) specification than trackbacks*.  But if the destination handles both equally well, AFAIAC, it's the end appearance is really important.  If anyone cares to add anything (relevant) to my understanding of these two methodologies, I'd be glad to listen.

IMHO, there are situations where trackbacks have an obvious advantage in WordPress because they use the Excerpt field for the content sent to the other blog.  No matter how contextual a pingback's automatically extracted paragraph maybe, it will not be better than a hand customized summary.

Even when the excerpt is automatically created for the trackback, there is a good chance that the trackback's excerpt will be more meaningful than the extraction made by the pingback.

Let me ask you.  In your opinion, which of these two real life examples better expresses the content of my article:

First, an example of a trackback (without a customized excerpt): 
****************
The Code Cave said,

NOnces have arrived in WP


Wordpress 2.03 is a critical security release. It eliminates the HTTP Referrer check and replaces it with a nonce system. What is a referrer check? Well, it is an attempt to confirm that an administrative action is being taken by an administrator in
 

Fri, 2 June 2006 9:13 am ? #
****************

Now, an example of a pingback for the same article: 
****************
[
] Here?s the link for the download: http://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/ If you want to get a smaller version of it, with only the changed files, go here: http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/06/01/wordpress-203-upgrade-changed-files-zip-changes-diff-changed-files-list/ I haven?t verified his file. So, you should do so on your own, or just bite the bullet and upload the whole release. [
] 

Pingback from The Code Cave on June 1, 2006 
****************


My article was primarily about nonces, but it contained a reference to the download of 2.03.  If I were looking at those two comments, I would be more likely to visit the article based upon the info in the trackback.  The pingback makes it look like just another "2.03 is released; download it here:" post.

I think looking at the comments for http://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/ gives you a good sampling of the actual working of trackbacks and pingbacks.  In the first 10, 6 of the 7 ping backs were 1 liners that really tell you nothing of the content of the article.  Looking at the first 20, being generous with the ones I can't read, 10 of 16 (maybe as high as 13 out of 16) are 1 liners that don't make the article appear to be worth visiting.

Though it is not meant to be this way, the pingbacks could be explained as a simple blip on the original blogs sonar to say that the article was referenced.  Whereas, trackbacks create an entry meant to be followed back to your blog.  

So, I think allowing Trackbacks to be used when author has manually expressed their intention to use a trackback only makes sense.

Might I be permitted to ask what may be a dumb question here as I  
have been following this and am somewhat confused. Sorry to break  
into the discussion  though.

Reading up in the codex, I understand a 'pingback' to occur when  
another site places a link in a post to an item on my site. That's  
what the codex suggests. Am I correct? My question is - am I supposed  
to be aware of this link being made? Is something supposed to happen  
at my end? because I have been using WP for just over a year and I  
see lots of people putting links to items of mine in their posts  but  
the only thing I see is the 'Incoming Links' on the dashboard. I do  
get the odd 'Trackback' show up in my comments list. Am I supposed to  
get 'Pingbacks' too? If not - what is the point of them?

I know this is not the right place but it's been bugging me for a  
while now - the not knowing bit :)

Places like this are better when they allow you to learn along the way.

Yes.

Yes, and maybe.  Pingbacks appear, as you said on the Incoming links list.
I don't believe trackbacks do, but I haven't paid that close attention to
it. Normally both appear in the comment list as well.  But themes can alter
how pingbacks and trackbacks appear.  Some themes include trackbacks and
pingbacks in the comments, as the default one does.  Others have pingbacks
and/or trackbacks in a separate area that you get to from a link.  You have
a very slick, but highly customized theme.  There's a good chance it
customizes *back behavior.

Hello All,


Ever since WP stopped showing feeds past the <!--more--> tag I?ve ?petitioned? to get it back, but I guess that?s not meant to be.

I just finished my first real plugin for WP (it?s *really* messy to deal with the_content in hooks?.. headache!) and it ensures that no matter what happens your entire article will display in the feed (Atom & RSS).

 

CompleteRSS 0.1: http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/216 

 

I don?t know if this?ll benefit anyone else here, but I just figured since this is where we had the ?disputes? over more tag cut-offs it would make sense to let you know about it?..

 

Hope someone will find it useful J

Frankly I find the feature of cutting after more useful in a RSS feed :)

I just noticed something interesting.  I left Andy a demo pingback here:
http://www.yellowswordfish.com/404/shine-on-you-crazy-diamond#comments
and it actually included the text generated by the Sociable plugin...

[.] So, I am creating a post that links back to his post here so that a ping
back is created on his site.  I will then alter another post to add a track
back to his site. Share and Enjoy:These icons link to social bookmarking
sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. [.] 

So, the pingbacks actually pull their excerpt from the_content where
Sociable plugs itself in.  Any which way, I know this isn't a major
end-of-the-world issue.  But it makes me wonder if there many other plugins
are there that add visual stuff this way since putting links at the end of
the post can't be all that rare.  

Should pingbacks maybe pull the post directly from the DB? Or should there
be an anchor/indicator of some sort of where the post actually content ends
and add-on text begins?

I'm guessing we should just leave this as is, but I wasn't sure if this was
a problem in the plugin or with how the the_content hook was implemented.
So, I thought I'd mention it.

There should be a bunch of action hooks -- up to four -- for before and 
after the post block (and possibly inside the post block but before and 
after the content block).  Since the_content is under 'wp control', at least 
before and after the content block should be easy to hook in.  Before and 
after the post block itself is a bit more difficult (I can only imagine it 
being somehow in has_posts(), given that's one of the few near-guaranteed WP 
calls in a theme).

That way, sociable, or the related-links stuff I just played with, could 
throw themselves after the content, but not INTO the content itself (a HUGE 
difference!).

I'd actually prefer the has_posts type solution, as it'd make things like my 
CG-Inbetween plugin (which can be useful for adsense, etc.) auto-hooking, as 
right now I make people edit their theme rather than try to hack into 
the_content -- which just isn't right. ;)  Actually, in a sense there's a 
'battle line' drawn -- that is there's a post DIV, and likely some kind of 
post-content (or 'entry') DIV, and the question is where you want plugins to 
be able to auto-output things.  You don't necessarily want it INSIDE the 
entry DIV with the main body text, you probably more likely want it AFTER 
the entry div, but still INSIDE the post DIV.  And that position has no WP 
call I can think of...

Subject: [wp-hackers] OT: Structured HTML tags
Message-ID: <010a01c6a5a9$7b84e1c0$02001aac@CPQSATYAM>

Off-Topic.  First of all my apologies for drawing your attention to this 
programming project of mine.

I posted this some time ago in generic PHP sites but didn't receive any 
reply to my proposal different from 'we all use templates like Smarty and so 
on, so this has no application'.   So, I suddenly realized that at least I 
won't get that answer in this forum since WP does echo actual HTML code, 
even WP templates do echo actual HTML.  So, at least, I count on not getting 
the sort of reply that I got at the PHP forums.

Another reason to post it here is that you are concerned about producing 
properly formatted HTML. WP validates against any validator, which shows 
that those who code it are really careful about standard compliance.  Thus, 
I would think that you would appreciate to have such compliance checked at 
compile time rather than after execution.   Well, not actually at compile 
time, since PHP is interpreted, but at pre-compile time, which is what I had 
in mind.

So, not that I want to wet your appetite since I  am sure I can hardly do 
so, I just better refer you to the document I improvised about it:

http://satyam.com.ar/StructuredTags2.htm

Thanks and my apologies again for taking your time.

Subject: [wp-hackers] trunk core dumps
Message-ID: <75835fe10607120633v1027ca45wb11fe67ebcdddc43@mail.gmail.com>

I think I have a serious problem...

I upgraded my 2.0.3 blog to trunk yesterday afternoon via SVN. Later
in the day, I went to upload some images and realized my account was
at it's disk quota, which I thought was odd. Since I'm the server
admin, I simply upped my quota, not thinking much about it.

This morning, my quota was reached again - an extra 150MB over
yesterday's. When I started digging into it - I noticed lots of
"core.####" files in my public_html directory and in public_html/blog
and most of the core dumps are 6-7MB in size. Not being a programmer,
I simply moved the dump files out of home directory and proceeded.

Thinking it might have been a probably with yesterday's SVN upgrade, I
went and svn up'd and got rev 4017. I tried to visit wp-admin/ to
upgrade the db, but was quite surprised when I simply received my
blog's front page while the address bar was still showing
http://www.wantmoore.com/blog/wp-admin/

Everytime I try to visit a page within wp-admin, I get a new core dump
file. Removing .htaccess yielded Internal Server Error pages.

Server is cPanel/WHM running RHEL 3 with Apache 1.3.34 , MySQL 4.0.25,
and PHP 4.3.11. Everything was grrrrreat until I decided to brave
trunk... any ideas?

First things first, for the future, please send mails like this to wp-testers.

Next, none of the information you gave us is enough to accurately
debug the issue. We'll need at least one or more of a few things.

1. phpinfo() output
2. Since you're dealing with core dumps and segfaults, ./configure
lines for apache if you installed it from source would help as well
(but I'm betting you used RHEL packages, if so, fine).
3. Check apache's error log for anything that may be related to this,
an error message that appears right before the crrash in the log,
anything to give us a hint. tail -f your error log and watch for
anything that might be of use to us.
4. As a last resort option, compiling PHP with debugging symbols and
using gdb to provide us with a stack trace from the dump file. You'll
need a line like this on the shell.
gdb /services/apache/bin/httpd /path/to/core.xxxxx
5. As an even worse last resort, step through the code, line by line,
adding a die(); at the end of each, until you find the line that
causes the crash.

I somehow feel like this is an extremely obvious answer, but is there a hook
for the Loop? Essentially to allow a plugin to change the structure of a
Loop (types of posts to be pulled, order of, display properties, etc) on the
fly...?

Once the query has run through, you can also filter the_posts to bump
some off or manipulate the order.

I guess I should stop being vague about my intents. The goal is a radical
redesign of my blog that allows user to choose three views. It's all about
architecture. Under one view (the default), the blog will be geared to the
standard reverse-chronological posting display. The second will take a
"recently commented" view which, in its intent, will display current
conversation based on comments/comment timestamps. Finally, I'll have a
reddit-style view that will allow most popular content float to the top
through votes.

Since the choice of view will be cookie-based, users will be able to have
their own choice to presentation style.

My problem is that every single one of these Loops is vastly different and
will have vastly different criteria for selection.

With that said, any advice on how to best tackle this?

Thanks,

Yeah. Grab the posts_request filter by the neck and swing it around
like you're slaughtering a chicken. Do any preliminary queries you
need to do, or modify the query as needed. Do your best Michael
Jackson Thriller impression, then return the query. WP_Query should
handle the rest. Eenie meenie minie moe, catch the_posts by the toe,
when Israel was in Egypt's land, let the_posts go.

Sorry, too much coffee. :-)

You know... I've actually slaughtered a chicken. Bloody mess that rooster
was. :)

WP_Query then contains every single post ever made? If that's the case,
pulling out only what I need is simple enough but for whatever reason, I
didn't think it actually had every post and was limited by the Max posts to
show on a page option.

Thanks. This is much more advanced than I've ever gotten before.

No... you should start dissecting WP_Query with your own two hands.
It'll be a lot less confusing when you find out what's actually being
passed around by these filters and how you can affect the process.

Try something like die(print_r($this->request, true)) just before the
get_results call (maybe line 921) of query.php.

No amount of advice from me or someone else can compare to a little
first-hand experience.

Thanks, Andy. I appreciate it. But you know... I've dissected WP_Query and
can't find a real reasonable way to get posts that have recent comments.
Heck, even if there was a way to pass a direct query to query_posts() I
could work up some query similar to the dozen and a half "recent comments"
plugins, but I don't even think I can directly pass SQL.

I don't normally do this because people ask too many questions once
you start feeding them code, but you won't ask any more questions
after this, right? ;-)

// Checks cookie or whatever, returns bool
function is_recently_commented() { ... }

// Returns array of post ID's using this:
// SELECT MAX(comment_date) as date,
//  comment_post_id
// FROM $wpdb->comments
// WHERE comment_approved = '1'
// GROUP BY comment_post_ID
// ORDER BY date DESC
function get_recently_commented() { ... }

// Filters the main query AND
function whatever($q) {
 global $wpdb;
 if ( is_recently_commented() ) {
  $ids = join(', ', get_recently_commented());
  return "$q AND ID IN ($ids)";
 } else
  return $q;
 }
}
add_filter('posts_where_paged', 'whatever');

For the record, I wasn't asking you to WRITE the code. But thanks. I'll try
it.

You may want to look at what Im doing in podPress.


function filter_the_posts($input) {
 $result = array();
 if(!is_array($input)) {
  return $input;
 }
 foreach($input as $value) {
  $value = $this->addPostData($value);
  if(!defined('PODPRESS_PODCASTSONLY') || !empty($value->podPressMedia)) {
   $result[] = $value;
  }
 }
 return $result;
}


If dealing with wordpress 2.x you used

add_action('the_posts', 'filter_the_posts');

for WP 1.5

add_filter('the_posts', 'filter_the_posts');


I changed the function names to make this easier to understand.
What I do is loop thru the list of posts and filter out the ones I want
to. Theres no reason you couldnt do the same thing

Try it in two passes -- at least that's how I would...  Query the comments 
table for unique/dinstinct post ID, order by comment time, limit N.  Then 
query the posts table with all the standard rules/where/filters, with the 
addition of "AND ID in (...comma'd list of IDs from the comments query...)". 
Well, something like that.  You could likely do it with a join, but would be 
N*M at the least...  A subquery is what you really want, do it all in one, 
optimized, query call -- but only more recent MySQL supports that (if I 
remember correct).

If you wanted to 'plug it in' to the current system, depends on the desired 
result.  Hooking the main query setup, doing the comments query yourself, 
then adding the ID list to the WHERE clause... well, it ain't pretty, but it 
should work.  If you then 'paged' through the system normally, you'd want to 
run the comments query again but do a limit X,Y to jump through the results. 
(I believe I do something similar in a number of the CG-Referrer filtered 
queries, but haven't looked at the code in a while!)

Message-ID: <74b84aa30607122344n62f101c1ud0113cdcd188194d@mail.gmail.com>

Putting on a normal end-user hat on [I was never anything else btw;
trying to shake-off the geek dust that I seem to have caught-on with
the excellent folks here on this forum :)]:

I am wondering if Wordpress should have simple toggle switches to
close/open all comments and pingbacks in one click for all old posts.

Everyone on this forum knows how easy it is to do this in PhpMyadmin,
but for those not aware of command lines or are afraid to use anything
other than what's available in Wordpress admin panel, this might be of
some good use?

Personally, I use Akismet. It does an awesome job. Until a month ago,
I used to have all posts open to comments and pingbacks, and I was
receiving spam on old entries of about 500 a day. Sometimes, I got
lucky and got around 1000 a day or so. Now after closing, I have just
about 5-10 per day.

I see having "close all comments and pingbacks" toggle switches
benefit in two ways:

1. It helps blog owner close all previous entries to comments and
pingbacks when he is bombarded with spam when his blog is deviod of
any plugin protection.

2. Reduces load on those wonderful spam services/plugins: Akismet,
Spam Karma and others.

My blog is sending less spam for verification to Akismet, when I am
able to turn off comments and pingbacks on old entries, for which I no
longer solicit comments. This way, my spam burden on Akismet is
reduced and Akismet may help two or three more in the same amount of
resources. Mutually beneficial?

If you get Spam Karma 2, it has a feature that does just that - it checks the post date with the date of the last accepted comment and compares the ratio of new comments to old comments on older articles - it gets rid of most comment spam for old things immediately :D

Subject: [wp-hackers] apache 2.2.2 upgrade
Message-ID: <013f01c6a6b5$bfe9f4b0$0300a8c0@greenville>

Over the past week I did a number of upgrades to one of my development
servers (which happens to be the box I run my personal web site on, using
WP). Anyway, after getting everything upgraded to the versions I wanted to
use which include Apache 2.2.2, php 4.4.2, and mySQL 4.1.x (plus a bunch of
other non-relevant things, all for an upcoming project) my WP site just
died. The server response according to the log files were 200 OK, but all
pages were just showing up as blank white pages. 

Thankfully, I had backed everything up as I normally do when I do something
like that, I also dumped the content of my WP database. I then dropped all
of the wp DB tables, and ran wp install again, then reloaded all of my
content. everything was up and running again within minutes with no problems
that I can see. 

My point is, that as other folks upgrade things like apache/mySQL are they
going to run into the same kinds of issues ? 
has anyone seen anything like this happen before ?

If this is a common situation I'd like to at least see that we get a quick
post to the codex about possible issues in upgrading. I've taken a look at
some upgrade issues discussed in the forum so far but haven't seen too much
along these lines. Adoption of the 2.-x branch of apache has been pretty
slow for a number of reasons (especially for the hosting providers), but I
have the feeling that's about to change, and can see a huge flood of these
kinds of issues hitting the forums, etc all at once as more folks move up to
the 2.x branch if there is some kind of common issue, which I'm not sure if
it's related to php or Apache in my situation. I've eliminated the DB as the
issue because I did that upgrade a couple of months ago and everything was
working fine until I flipped over to Apache 2.2.2 with mod_php 4.4.2, so the
issue was with one of those. 

The wp install process, as well as db reload all went super smooth as I
mentioned. the site wasn't down for more than 15 minutes, but the point is
after the upgrades things should have just continue to run as normal. A
couple of other php apps on the box had no problem -- including my "sandbox"
install of wp located at http://hradil.us/sandbox/wp/ --- I didn't need to
touch that one it just worked as expected. Maybe it was a specific plugin ? 

thoughts ??

Do you by any chance have WP-Cache or Statictize (Reloaded) installed?

I'm a WP power-user so I'll field this question.

Drop this at the top of your theme header.php:

<?php ini_set('display_errors', on'); ?>

You should find errors displaying. My feeling is this is actually a PHP
upgrade issue and plugin conflicts. We strive for cross-compatibility hard
for the core code in the WP hackers group.

Secondly, copy the contents your plugins folder out and start
replacing/activating one by one if you can. When it bombs, look at that
plugin.

Lots of things could be at issue.

Do you by any chance have WP-Cache or Statictize (Reloaded) installed?

I think that's what caused it, at least when I had wp-cache and changed almost anything on to do with Apache or PHP I would experience this.

actually this <?php ini_set('display_errors', on'); ?> is going to be
something I can use for another project, so thanks, I hadn't thought of
trying that. as I mentioned, the really strange part was that after I did
the re-install I just reloaded the DB with all the old info, including
plugin settings, etc and everything worked just fine. the sandbox site/link
I included earlier didn't have the wp-cache plugin installed, so maybe that
was it.

speaking of plugins, have you ever played with the extended-live-archives
plugin ? I tried using that for something prior to the upgrade, and it made
a real mess of things on the backend, as well as with some of the
permalinks. I never could seem to completely get rid of it either, for
example after deactivating/removing plugin files I kept getting weird errors
in the admin->manage->files area, it was complaining about not being able to
find a file or function related to extended-live-archives. Since the clean
install, that problem seems to be gone now as well.

First time posting here, but I been lurking for quiet some time.

The problem is most likely in your wp-cache. Make sure that
wp-content/advanced-cache.php is actually a link to
wp-content/advanced-cache.php to
wp-content/plugins/wp-cache/wp-cache-phase1.php. If it is not then it will
cause the blank page problem. I went through the exact same thing about a
month ago.

On a related topic, I've been meaning to mention the widgets problem I'd
discussed with Andy Skelton.  In the end it was related to the change in
array_merge between PHP4 and PHP5 and could occur in anyone's code.  So, if
someone missed this array_merge change, I thought a public post might be
beneficial...  

PHP5's array_merge now blows up on non-array variables.  It seems some PHP
array functions, specifically array_slice, return non-array (unset)
variables.  So, in short, an array_merge that works in php4 may not work in
php5 unless you follow the same convention Mark Jaquith recommended when he
said "cast to array before foreach".  

If a variable's content hasn't already been verified as containing an array,
you should cast to array before using it in an array_merge.  
That could look like this:
  $result = array_merge(array('a'=>1,'b'=>2), (array) $second);

Details on the change can of course be seen here:
http://us2.php.net/array_merge

I'm sure this is old news for some. So, unless you want details of what we
changed, you probably won't care to read on.

---- 

For a practical example, we could look at the now fixed issue from
widgets.php.

An array slice was done in a fashion similar to this:
  $registered_widgets[$name]['params'] => array_slice(func_get_args(), 2)

We are assuming that the problem arose when the 2 argument was defaulted to
''.

The line that actually blew up was this one:
 $params = array_merge(array($sidebar),
$registered_widgets[$name]['params']);

The error was:
"Warning: array_merge() [function.array-merge]: Argument #2 is not an array
in ./wp-content/plugins/widgets/widgets.php on line 154"

There is nothing that indicates array_slice changed between 4 and 5.  So, it
appears the only difference was in array_merge.  Wrapping the error line in
an "if (is_array($registered_widgets[$name]['params']))" solved the problem,
but it was not the fix we used.

I remembered Mark's coding style suggestion for foreach in
(http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-July/006930.html) and
applying it solved the problem in a simpler fashion.  Andy checked in this
new line:
  $params = array_merge(array($sidebar), (array)
$registered_widgets[$name]['params']);

FYI, we'd tried this first:
  $registered_widgets[$name]['params'] => (array)
array_slice(func_get_args(), 2)
but it had no affect.

-

I looked at every instance of array_merge in the 2.03 code, and it seems
that all of them are in places where the parameters are guaranteed to have
either a value or array() specified.  So, this is mostly a heads up to
plugin authors.  I haven't done any examination of the plugin code base.

I've purposely avoided php5 for now for a number of reasons, but this is
useful info, as I have seen a similar problem with a couple of folks using
php5, and I think this might be a good "quick fix". thanks...

by the way, have you (or anyone on the list) been using or upgraded to MySQL
5.xx branch ?  Any issues/quirks, etc ?

I have a big project coming up that I'd like to be using 5.xx for but I'm a
little afraid to upgrade my dev box (which I have my live personal site on)
because it's also going to mean rebuilding php and a couple of other things
on the box.

My server has 4 and 5 both installed. I've been running 5 since the bug
hunt.

I put the following as the first line in .htaccess to send use the php5
engine:

AddType x-mapp-php5 .php

When I've had this happen before it was related to a PHP accelerator. 
Check out the error logs and let us know if you find anything. I haven't 
heard of anything like this happening lately.

Hey,  Guru. Love your new posting style! Chetan, I am having
exactly  the same problem as that which you describe. I also
read  your  items  which explain how to  disable  everything
through  phpmyadmin  and I consider doing so myself. Even  a
CAPTCHA  filter  no longer works, after over year  of  being
highly  effective.  I threw away Spaminator quite some  time
back  and  I suggest you try Spam Karma 2. I only ever  hear
good things about SK2. Akismet likewise, but I believe these
two interfere with one another (if not totally collide).

Best wishes,

Roy

Seems like there are conflicts with SK2 and the Automattic Akismet
plugin, but why not just get the best of both worlds:
http://www.sebbi.de/archives/2005/10/31/spam-karma-2-akismet-plugin-beta/

I've not used it personally, so I have no idea if it still works.

What's the world coming to when our plugins have plugins of their own? Wow.

This  happens a lot at application level as well. I am aware
that you are Linux-savvy, so you will know this rather well.
Taking  WordPress  as an example, there are CMS's out  there
which  integrate WordPress with some other 'beasts' such  as
Coppermine  and  re-distribute. What about K2, Lynceum,  and
Lightpress, for instance?

Then  come to consider PHP-Nuke, which contains phpBB, among
plenty  of other re-used and grossly grafted code. It's  the
beauty  of  the GPL, leading to faster development  of  more
versatile  software.  The  end-user  benefits,  as  well  as
developers  who undertake a new project, e.g. MySQL, PHP  ->
b2 -> WP.

Best wishes,

Roy

I handle the backend work for two very popular political blogs that are on
Wordpress (combined hits for the two are about 3/4 million a day). The
comment spam is a nightmare. One thing I did that helped reduce a lot of it
was to rename wp-comments-post.php to a random name and update the comment
form's action to that new name. That greatly reduced the amount of spam.
Instead of getting hit with 400-500 spam comments at once, they now get
maybe 5-10 a day. 

There is a plugin to auto-close comments on posts after X number of days. It
is available here:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Auto_shutoff_comments

We are getting ready to do that on one site. The only changes I want to make
are removing some of the hooks. Considering there are 12-15 posts a day on
this site with each post getting 200-300 comments, I am removing all the
hooks and just having it activate when a post is published/saved (need to
save every bit I can on the server).

I always wondered if someone did that.  It seems like a great way to reduce
spam, but of course if WordPress adopted that in the core, spam bots would
come out that parse the name of the comment form prior to spamming.

I've done that for the past two and a half years! ;)

It helps, but since the file name is noted in the form, script kiddies can 
and do pull it from there.

Beyond that, on a new site you can remove the generator meta (so automatic 
scripts don't immediately 'see' the name "Wordpress", and know what to look 
for...).

Additionally, captcha or nonce type authentication (if not registration) 
would pretty much shut off the rest.  Well, 99.9%.

I've used a custom plugin for my site's entire existence -- not as elaborate 
as SK2 (maybe more like SK1... ;)), but mostly gets the job done.  Though, 
I'd have more fun designing for a site getting .75M hits/day -- send me some 
of that traffic! ;)

CAPTCHAs exclude the blind, though. Much better to use a combination of 
Bad Behavior and Akismet/Spam Karma, IMO.

You could implement this without affecting updates if you just
included the randomized URL in your comment form's template, and then
used an htaccess redirect to screen direct requests, and point the
randomized ones back to the correct location.

But yeah, it's basically like Meyer's Orange filter; stops working
when too many start using it.

I've had only one spam message out of 2,335 actually show up on my blog
since I installed Akismet. On a rare occasion they'd get pulled into the
moderation queue when Akismet was down, but other than that Akismet's
been taking care of me.

I've had two slip through to the blog and two get into the moderation Q this
month.  I had at least 1 before that.

Akismet has largely been effective.  But I'm still running low under the
spammer radar with only 308 caught since March.  I've disabled the referrer
filtering in the .htaccess and it has increased the spam but not by that
much.  Referrer filtering worked well through last year but I think it is
well past its heyday.

I've had 0 get through out of nearly 7,000, and the rate that get 
through to Akismet has dropped quite a lot since I installed Bad 
Behavior. I don't even think about spam anymore, it's great :)

two things:

1. I included 'nonce' in that sentence specifically as nonce stuff is 
typically non-user-intervention methods (via JS mostly, though some could be 
done with just form-embedded bits depending on the spammers!).

2. bitmap font captchas certainly would, but there are numerous captcha 
systems that are tolerant (Pick X from the list below, type the Xth word of 
this sentence, etc.).  They may not be as 'friendly' as no auth method at 
all, but again there ARE captcha methods that don't exclude the blind.

I'm all for usability, but at some points you need to 'raise the bar' to 
prevent spammers -- that bar could be 'JS-required', or some sort of 
captcha, or the best captcha of all: registration. ;)

I use CG-AntiSpam (my 'SpamKarma' equiv) and CG-Referrer in combination to 
combat spam -- they have some of the same functions that SK and BB have, but 
I've now seen BB block things that would drive many non-techie site owners 
nuts.  That's not that BB is bad, it's that people out there with legit 
sites don't always have 'perfect scripts'. ;)

Speaking of BB - can anyone email me the script or point me to an alternate download URI? Michael Hampton's official download URI at http://www.homelandstupidity.us/software/bad-behavior/bad-behavior-download/ returns an error 400 - I'm not sure if that means my IP is blocked (I'm on the RIPE network), or if he has server-side issues.

This time I read the message all the way through (I know, I know, RTFM), and I realized it wasn't the standard 400 error - it said there was a bug in Opera that means all Opera users can't access sites with BB - ridiculous since Opera 9 is really the best of the 3 ATM!!

I just sent the dev an email at badbots@ioerror.us, the technical error report says:
"This problem may be caused by a bug in old versions of the Opera web browser. If you use Opera, please update to the latest version and try again."

But obviously this _is_ the latest version, and I'm in trouble... I'll prolly hack the code to enable Opera users until he gets back to me... too bad really!

Hmm.. something's not right.  I have BB2 on my site and I can browse
to it with Opera 9 just fine.  Are you using the actual released
version or one of the earlier betas?

Latest.

It gets weirder. I installed it on my local server and it works just fine, but on my production server on neosmart.net it blocks me off. 
Even more, just like the documentation for BB says, if you have WP-Cache, cached pages aren't protected unless you patch WP-Cache. Indeed, I can browse the main blog just fine in Opera because WP-Cache is on, but if I access, say, the admin URI, I'm blocked.

Disabling WP-Cache: my entire site becomes inaccessible from Opera.

It's definitely Opera and not, say, a proxy issue, because I can access my site from IE perfectly.
But then again, I can access my local server via Opera w/ BB installed without trouble.....

Today I was running some tests with wp-cache 2 as I am planning to upgrade my Simple Thoughts ( http://blog.taragana.com ) site to WP 2.0.3. The results surprised me.

WordPress 2.0.3 consistently performs better without WP-Cache 2 than with it, by a significant margin. I triple checked my results.
Have anyone else tested? Also we experienced more page load failures in heavy load (stress testing) with WP-Cache 2 than without.

So you might be better of without WP-Cache 2 than with it.

And yes as Jamie has pointed out WP-Cache 2 is very likely the cause of your blank screen problem.

Have a good weekend,

First time posting here, but I been lurking for quiet some time.

The problem is most likely in your wp-cache. Make sure that
wp-content/advanced-cache.php is actually a link to
wp-content/advanced-cache.php to
wp-content/plugins/wp-cache/wp-cache-phase1.php. If it is not then it will
cause the blank page problem. I went through the exact same thing about a
month ago.

I've purposely avoided php5 for now for a number of reasons, but this is
useful info, as I have seen a similar problem with a couple of folks using
php5, and I think this might be a good "quick fix". thanks...

by the way, have you (or anyone on the list) been using or upgraded to MySQL
5.xx branch ?  Any issues/quirks, etc ?

I have a big project coming up that I'd like to be using 5.xx for but I'm a
little afraid to upgrade my dev box (which I have my live personal site on)
because it's also going to mean rebuilding php and a couple of other things
on the box.

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHP4->5 upgrade heads up

On a related topic, I've been meaning to mention the widgets problem I'd
discussed with Andy Skelton.  In the end it was related to the change in
array_merge between PHP4 and PHP5 and could occur in anyone's code.  So, if
someone missed this array_merge change, I thought a public post might be
beneficial...  

PHP5's array_merge now blows up on non-array variables.  It seems some PHP
array functions, specifically array_slice, return non-array (unset)
variables.  So, in short, an array_merge that works in php4 may not work in
php5 unless you follow the same convention Mark Jaquith recommended when he
said "cast to array before foreach".  

If a variable's content hasn't already been verified as containing an array,
you should cast to array before using it in an array_merge.  
That could look like this:
  $result = array_merge(array('a'=>1,'b'=>2), (array) $second);

Details on the change can of course be seen here:
http://us2.php.net/array_merge

I'm sure this is old news for some. So, unless you want details of what we
changed, you probably won't care to read on.

---- 

For a practical example, we could look at the now fixed issue from
widgets.php.

An array slice was done in a fashion similar to this:
  $registered_widgets[$name]['params'] => array_slice(func_get_args(), 2)

We are assuming that the problem arose when the 2 argument was defaulted to
''.

The line that actually blew up was this one:
 $params = array_merge(array($sidebar),
$registered_widgets[$name]['params']);

The error was:
"Warning: array_merge() [function.array-merge]: Argument #2 is not an array
in ./wp-content/plugins/widgets/widgets.php on line 154"

There is nothing that indicates array_slice changed between 4 and 5.  So, it
appears the only difference was in array_merge.  Wrapping the error line in
an "if (is_array($registered_widgets[$name]['params']))" solved the problem,
but it was not the fix we used.

I remembered Mark's coding style suggestion for foreach in
(http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-July/006930.html) and
applying it solved the problem in a simpler fashion.  Andy checked in this
new line:
  $params = array_merge(array($sidebar), (array)
$registered_widgets[$name]['params']);

FYI, we'd tried this first:
  $registered_widgets[$name]['params'] => (array)
array_slice(func_get_args(), 2) but it had no affect.

-

I looked at every instance of array_merge in the 2.03 code, and it seems
that all of them are in places where the parameters are guaranteed to have
either a value or array() specified.  So, this is mostly a heads up to
plugin authors.  I haven't done any examination of the plugin code base.

Message-ID: <07c801c6a773$197a9760$6e01a8c0@sixfour>

All the sites I've ever worked on performance problems with have had 
significant performance boosts from wp-cache.  My own site has used 
Staticize (the precursor) to survive a slashdotting.

It really depends on server config.  I mean, I guess it's possible if your 
disk caching sucks (small cache, slow drives, whatever), and your MySQL 
memory caching is huge, and a fast cpu, then dynamically processing the 
pages is faster than wp-cache checking stuff and loading the thing in off of 
disk (especially big pages).  That'd certainly be HD dependent at that 
point.

Otherwise, I'd be shocked that loading a cache file from disk (which should 
be in disk cache/memory for frequent data) takes longer than processing the 
main query, plus running the various transformation code, plus plugins, 
plus...  Just wouldn't make physical sense based on the code execution. 
Well, again, unless disk is slow and cpu is fast -- AND maybe you have an 
opcode cache running, which would significantly impact performance.

Most shared hosts have fast drives, slow SQL, and no opcode cache. ;)

I'm on the latest, I don't _think_ I installed a weekly build on this OS, but I can't be too sure.
Either way, I've found and patched the particular issue, refer to http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/221 for more details. It solves all Opera-related issues, and makes BB truly safe with very few false-positives.

Message-ID: <005e01c6a7a7$222fc1d0$0300a8c0@greenville>

To all --
thanks for the input. 

in terms of a little follow up, everything seems to work OK with 2.2.2
Apache platform as well as the other items mentioned, 
there are some quirks here and there depending on your specific platform
(I've tested on both redhat linux and Win XP/Apache/MySQL)

I would suggest that anyone considering upgrading from the 1.3xx branch of
Apache just go ahead and make the move to 2.2.2. I've noted similar
performance gains as mentioned in at least one earlier post as well. Also
have tested xoops, coppermine photo gallery, phpBB, gallery 2, sugar crm,
and a couple of other apps I commonly use for clients using the most current
versions and as noted below, everything works, no major issues. 

I would make one suggestion to anyone considering these upgrades in addition
to just skipping over the 2.0.x apache version, do a SQL dump of your
existing databases (data and structure) prior to the upgrades. I've found
that especially with WP (I think the two offending plugins were WP-Cache and
extended-archives) it was just easier to do a clean install then drop the
new tables created in the db, then import the old tables. I did this process
for a couple of sites and everything is perfect. 


best....chris

This might be OT seeing as though I'm about to talk about my guestbook
software, not WP; though a teensy bit of WP code is used in the
guestbook!

I did a similar thing with my guestbook software
<http://narnia.bounceme.net/jeremy/projects/guestbook/>. I basically
required a unique ID to be generated into a hidden INPUT field on the
comments form and is validated upon submission. This technique is very
similar to nonces. Probably even identical.

I looked at the way spam bots were hitting my "guinea pig" guestbook
(like several hundred in a day :D) and I noticed that they never
actually hit the index page and just posted straight to sign.php (or
wp-comments-post.php in WP's case). So I went and put in the "Unique ID"
protection to force the bots to visit the index page first (the unique
ID is only retrievable via index.php), which 99% of them don't (they
must use the Google Cache or something to find out what my form looks
like), thus rejecting the spam comments!

Like you noted Brian, spam bots would come out that parse the unique id
in the form first but at this present time the spammers don't seem to be
concerned about the minority of blogs having some sort of protection.

I haven't looked at the wordpress internals in a LONG while, so I don't
know how feasible this is, but I've heard two other approaches that have
worked:

1) Allow posting of comments only through javascript.

2) One I'm using in a rails app: if a request is given for certain urls
and there's no variable set (from a prior page) in the session object,
then redirect instead of serving the page.

redirect_to 'index' and return if session[:last_page_id].nil?

In-Reply-To: <07c801c6a773$197a9760$6e01a8c0@sixfour>
Message-ID: <006401c6a7bc$9547d1c0$0300a8c0@greenville>

I'm working on testing some of the caching features built in to both 2.2.2
apache and MySQL 5.xx as opposed to using wp-cache,  - prior to upgrading
Apache, etc. so, something like 1GB mem/80gb HD (7200rpm)/ and something
close to 2G processor which is about how my dev box is configured (red hat,
v 7.1), this box also runs my personal web site, and a couple of other
relatively low traffic sites. for a while I was letting a friend store his
eBay images on the box, so it was really getting hammered, something like
250K images/hits/day. so, under that load plus my site (traffic varies from
around 10k hits/day to more than 50k depending on what I have going on, wp
was taking around .55 seconds to load the "home" page with the cache
enabled, and sometimes as long as 2.xx seconds (a few times even WAY longer)
without. So I'd have to agree that there's no doubt the WP-cache is a great
plugin and it certainly works. 

As I mentioned, I'm going to play around with some of the newer caching
features of Apache 2.2.2 and MySQL 5.xx without the WP cache first, then
with the cache to see what kind of difference if any there is. 

One interesting concept I think would be playing around with the DB and
making use of things like views and stored procedures, etc, in the past I've
done a good amount of work with Oracle and MS-SQL, and we've seen tremendous
benefits from things like using pre-compiled code within the db, well
written views and sp's, etc. So, I think performance wise the newer versions
of Apache and MySQL in particular could really have an impact, especially on
a busy site. I have a couple of projects in the pipeline at the moment, and
to be honest, I'm a little nervous about using WP for them because I know
that they're going to be pretty heavy traffic sites, with definite potential
for the occasionally digg-dugg/slashdot pounding. 

I don't really like many of the alternatives to WP out there, but something
like the platforms that "publish" some content to "static" html pages would
make me a little more comfortable for these kinds of projects, rather than
relying on the DB for everything. So like I said, based on my initial
playing around with 2.2.2 and the file-caching capability, that pretty much
transparently gives WP similar capabilities as the "publish" type platforms,
but should also be much more efficient. Of course the production box for
those sites is a dell PowerEdge dual 1.5Ghz Xeon/2GB ram/270GB raid 5 box
which will only be running two or three sites, so I'm thinking that should
be more than sufficient for the occasional digg/slashdot crush.

WordPress 2.0.3 consistently performs better without WP-Cache 2 than with

Have anyone else tested? Also we experienced more page load failures in

So you might be better of without WP-Cache 2 than with it.

OK, I've been confused on this for a while; somebody please set me  
straight.

WP 2+ already  includes a  /wp-content/cache directory. If I make it  
apache-writable, it gets populated and constantly updated with fresh  
cache files. No plugins or modifications necessary.

I've found references around the web to the fact that WP2 includes  
full Smarty caching, out of the box. So I've inferred that caching is  
fully present and working.

But I also  keep seeing references to WP-Cache 2, as if caching  were  
NOT already present in WP 2.

What's the real caching deal?

Thanks,
Scot

Exactly the same situation here. In fact I was as surprised as you were with the results. We repeated the tests over several configurations with same results.
Then I understood. WordPress 2.0.3 already includes caching. It just so happens that their caching mechanism alone is more efficient than Wp-cache 2. I will share the results on Monday when my developer who did the testing is back.

None of the above are an issue. In fact feel free to repeat the tests yourself. This is what I did:
Selected a large amount of url's from the web site. Then took a random subset and tested with one configuration, incrementally increasing the number of threads. After completion I cleared the cache and repeated for the other configuration. The results are averaged. Several runs were made to rule out statistical errors.

You are forgetting WordPress 2.0.3 also does caching the same way as wp-cache 2. So it is really a comparison between caching systems.

WP 2.0+ includes an object-caching system.  It caches data objects  
frequently used by WP, e.g. user data, category data, page data.  The  
system is pluggable, but has built-in support for caching to the  
filesystem.  This system was enabled by default in 2.0 and 2.0.1

In 2.0.2, it was turned off, because certain setups were causing  
problems.  So now it has to be intentionally enabled in wp-config.php  
in order to work.

This system, no matter what backend it uses (there are drop in  
backends for APC and Memcached), is not a substitute for WP-Cache2.   
The benefits of the built-in object cache are small, but WP-Cache2  
can give you several orders of magnitude more page-serving power,  
because it caches the HTML output of pages for a particular URL +  
Cookie combination.  Cached hits use no DB calls and very little  
processing power (as WP isn't fully loaded for the hit).

Both systems offer speed and throughput benefits, and complement each  
other, as they cache different things.  The built-in cache speeds up  
your dynamic hits, and WP-Cache2 caches your dynamic hits so that  
subsequent hits use fewer resources.

WP 2.0.3's built-in (but disabled) object cache is not a substitute  
for an output cache... they are different beasts.  Even with the  
object cache on and populated, you still need to make several DB hits  
for each WP request, and WP needs to be fully loaded for each  
request.  The object cache merely reduces the number of DB hits.  WP- 
Cache eliminates all DB hits for cached hits, and skips the full  
loading of WP.

This may not be a real world scenario.  After clearing the WP-Cache2  
cache, yes the server will work harder, as it dynamically serves  
pages and writes the output to disk.  But once the popular pages have  
been cached for the cookie-less user, the load will drop considerably  
because subsequent requests will be served from flat files, using  
very few CPU cycles.  It makes sense that a dynamic hit with WP- 
Cache2 would take more time than a dynamic hit without WP-Cache2...  
and if all your hits are unique, then WP-Cache2 isn't for you.   But  
the vast majority of sites serve lots of duplicate requests, and  
would greatly benefit from WP-Cache2.

WP 2.0.3's built-in (but disabled) object cache is not a substitute  
for an output cache... they are different beasts.  Even with the  
object cache on and populated, you still need to make several DB hits  
for each WP request, and WP needs to be fully loaded for each  
request.  The object cache merely reduces the number of DB hits.  WP- 
Cache eliminates all DB hits for cached hits, and skips the full  
loading of WP.

This may not be a real world scenario.  After clearing the WP-Cache2  
cache, yes the server will work harder, as it dynamically serves  
pages and writes the output to disk.  But once the popular pages have  
been cached for the cookie-less user, the load will drop considerably  
because subsequent requests will be served from flat files, using  
very few CPU cycles.  It makes sense that a dynamic hit with WP- 
Cache2 would take more time than a dynamic hit without WP-Cache2...  
and if all your hits are unique, then WP-Cache2 isn't for you.   But  
the vast majority of sites serve lots of duplicate requests, and  
would greatly benefit from WP-Cache2.

Many thanks for the info Mark. This sounds like something that really  
needs to get into the Codex. I'll try and add some documentation  
about caching options in the near future.

WP2's 'object cache' should be disabled on anything except a dedicated 
server, along with one of the memory cache drop-ins and not the base system. 
And, you should be an intermediate to expert WAMP admin type..

Otherwise, it has been shown to be of negligible performance difference, the 
root of a number of security issues, possibly the root of some memory 
issues, and the cause of many wacky headaches for new users.

WP-Cache otoh is a descendant of "Staticize", a hack for WP1 that captures 
page results as PHP, ALMOST getting to 'static pages'... but not quite since 
it still has to load and run some PHP code to get there.  With a PHP opcode 
cache, and a well tuned system, I'd expect it to run pretty darn fast -- not 
quite raw HTML, but more than fast enough for slashdottings.  It could be 
further modified for sites that are primarily static to cache to raw HTML, 
if there's no need for PHP to execute (or, PHP could execute via the 'fake 
gif link' technique.. or via JS).

David, that is an excellent explanation, and good fodder for the earlier
mentioned codex entry.

Marks explaination of the WP2 cache starting with the "It caches date
frequently.." sentence would fit nicely after your WP2 paragraph.
Concluding that it should only be used on dedicated servers - and not on
a non-dedicated/shared host server.

I'd like to ask a similar question about WP-Cache2.  Is there any reason
why a blog should not run WP-Cache2?  

I know this is a basic functionality question, but does it invalidate
the cache correctly when an article is edited?

I haven't explored into WP's caching mechanism. So my statement of similarity was restricted to the fact that they both (wp2 & wp cache 2) use caching. I now realize they employ pretty different methods.

My test configuration was:
Web Server machine & clients:
Pentium 4 1.8Ghz running on 256MB RAM. 
No special configuration or optimization was done other than increasing the threads on Apache server to 250.
I am using a custom theme with lots of plugins. You can see it working at http://test.taragana.net/

I am very much interested to see someone repeat the test in a better configuration and compare the results.

The difference I observed was statistically significant. I can get more data on Monday if you are interested.

Best,
Angsuman

256MB of RAM and 250 apache threads? No wonder everything is slow
there, your apache threads are easily eating every bit of RAM
available and likely swapping like crazy, causing a huge throughput
issue. Anything would likely preform horribly on that configuration.

Well, for low-use/low-access blogs, it's just not worth the overhead.

Additionally, for sites that have a lot of plugins doing random-style 
output, you need to either customize your code to work within the cache, or 
lose the randomization.  In fact, that goes for anything 'dynamic' in PHP. 
For instance, an RSS Aggregator -- you could have it set to update every 30 
minutes, but if the WP-Cache plugin is set to 2 hours, a cached page won't 
update for 2 hours, period.

So, not always a great fit for heavily plugin-oriented, non-programmer, 
dynamic sites...

Hi,

I'm new to this list, but allow me to introduce myself. I've been  
hanging around in #wordpress for a while now, and I'm pretty active  
in those parts. A few of you probably know me, but more or less, I'm  
kind of new.

Now, over the past few months, something has gone horribly horribly  
wrong. As the reputation and size of the WordPress irc channel has  
grown, so has the need for moderation. The troll average has gone  
from every few months to every few weeks on average now. It's a total  
mess when they come in, because photomatt isn't usually around or  
tells us to just ignore them. Heck, I've even gotten lilo involved  
and I have him as saying that the channel policies we have are  
completely opposite of the freenode policies. photomatt told me that  
operators aren't meant to babysit channels, which, in a sense they  
are. The policy of freenode isn't not to have operators at all, it's  
just not to flash their operator privileges. We need to have some  
policy or appoint some operators to do something about this, because  
it's getting more and more out of hand.

Just this morning, we had a lively bunch of about five from the GNAA  
(troll group, google it) come in and just start DCC'ing everyone with  
an exploit, and it took me forever to get ahold of someone who could  
help. And there have been countless others as well. The karma feature  
was disabled on wpbot because of a 13 year old ADD spoiled brat with  
a Macbook Pro who kept bragging and eventually discovered the karma  
feature. And there have been more before that that deserved to be  
kicked.

I know this has been beaten to death time and time before, but  
something needs to be done about this once and for all. The wordpress  
irc channel is a trivial part of the wordpress community.

Anthony Cole

yes, I agree that there are times when moderation needs to be exercised. But
then again, I'm not always staring at my IRC screen to elaborate since half
the time, I'm idle. I usually just see folks changing their herald,
promoting their own blogs, leaving notes for other users, querying the bots
for codex and Google search, and generally speaking, folks helping out each
other. Maybe it's gotten worse lately, and i think it's bound to escalate if
any within the next few months. WordPress is becoming popular, and so is the
IRC channel. :) I'm sure Matt & and the gang is willing to look into the
situation and if found reasonable will be more than willing to accommodate a
few selected moderators just in case something necessary has to be done. :)

my 2 cents.

This has come up numerous times before and its the same thing...
photomatt says that #wordpress isn't for support so he really isn't
concerned with what goes on in there. It has even come up at meetups
before. I have tried numerous times to get it through their head that we
do need ops, for the sake of the channel and decency of the community
and he seems to care less.

There was at one point, a time where we did have a troll, and he did
give someone ops for about 2 days until the person ended up getting
banned from freenode.

This is why I have given up on #wordpress and the community in general.
His lack of care (for lack of a better term) is what drove me away.
Wordpress is a great product, but when the community goes to shit, well...

I used to be in the forums alot as well as on #wordpress and the mailing
lists.. since the meetup where we fought over ops and he still declined
to do anything about it... I have pretty much dropped myself off the
map. From what I've read in the forums and the mailing list, I know
there are others that have taken similar actions and removed themselves
from the community.

Matt, if you're reading this... for the sake of the community, please
try to understand that giving ops isn't asked for as a status issue, but
for the good of the community.

Previously we have gone through the issues of how to pick people and how
it will work... please solicit 5-10 long-time active participants in
#wordpress and see if they will volunteer. I know most aren't around all
the time, but if you get a group of 5 that agree, someone should be
active at most times.

As do I. It's ridiculous. We're losing people in droves; very good
people, at that (both in personality and contribution). It's an IRC
channel, Ops are needed *and* expected (I've seen many people come in
and wonder where the ops are). If you don't care, Matt, then hand the
reigns over to someone else and let it be what it is. If not, appoint
a few ops. It's not hurting you or anyone else to do so.

I'll have to hop in and agree, and I'm glad someone else brought this
thread up again (I really hate being the one who has to try to drill a
point home, you know?). This is a lot of the reason why I left for
some time, and now I occasionally come back, but every time I do it
reminds me of why I stopped visiting in the first place. It used to be
a really fun place to hang around, I used to enjoy helping out when
and where I could, and talking with the others in the mean time, but
its just lost its dazzle under the plethora of people unwilling to
help or at least be polite when someone else is trying to help. Hell,
I was even back for a few days not too long ago, only to leave when I
found out that someone who I requested a ban for months ago was back
trolling around again.

But alas, I fear this is another cry to fall upon deaf ears.

Actually, I don't think that person was ever banned from freenode, but
I do know that that exact person was back and trolling about again a
few days ago, but I am powerless to do anything, in fact, it took days
of begging in meetups and this list to even get him banned in the
first place.

Agreed, entirely.

I wouldn't mind seeing this at all, and I know who a few good
candidates are, or at least who might've been good candidates back
when I was on IRC. Who there is now, I'm not sure.

(stuff snipped wrt IRC idjits)

Yes, I'd like ops too. I understand Matt's decision to let the weeds
grow in the #wordpress channel, because "it's not the support place" but
the adolescents who come in are pretty disruptive. 

I hang out there frequently, and it's about the level of help I can
offer; I try to help out with linux/apache issues.

To follow up on references regarding some of the things I said... Here
is a link to the transcript of the meetup where it was majorly addressed:

http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog


It also came up throughout the month of July, but was ignored or hushed.
http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/July


July 6, 2005 - Ignored... never even mentioned even though it was on the
topics to discuss.


July 13, 2005 - Matt never showed, meetup canceled.


Taken from July 20th, 2005
(http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/July/July20RawLog)

[17:40] <photomatt_wrk> I see the IRC topic is brought up again, is
anyone actually interested in discussing that?
[17:40] <relle> Granting voice to regular users who are helpful, a way
to show who is knowlegable and trustworthy in #wordpress
[17:40] <photomatt_wrk> I think it's been run into the ground already
<!--snip-->
[17:42] <photomatt_wrk> on IRC we don't need administrative people
policing things
[17:42] <photomatt_wrk> freenode handles that
<!--snip-->
[17:46] <photomatt_wrk> on IRC to give people titles would create a
class distinction between people in the chat
<!--snip-->
[17:46] <photomatt_wrk> and we would need a complicated and PITA process
to decide who gets titles and not
[17:46] <photomatt_wrk> and people who didn't have titles would be pissy


July 27, 2005 - Once again Matt never showed, IRC topic came up... same
things were reiterated... but without Matt to make a decision and
actually do something about it, nothing was done.


Taken from August 3, 2005
(http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/August/August03RawLog)

[17:25] <relle> Next? IRC
<!--snip-->
[17:26] <photomatt> what are we discussing about IRC?
[17:27] <tunicwriter> Was the matter ever really resolved?
[17:27] <relle> In the meeting last week, there was a discussion about
an "invasion" from a bad person and the need for volunteer ops to kick
those people out.
[17:27] <relle> Guidelines were to be written on what that meant.
[17:27] <relle> Were they?
[17:28] <photomatt> ops wouldn't have made a difference
[17:28] <photomatt> in situations like that someone from freenode has to
handle it
[17:28] <masq|lappy> I think they mean in the general invasion of an
impolite person more than that exact situation
[17:28] <tunicwriter> indeed.
[17:29] <masq|lappy> I don't think we'll see that situation again, I
sent the VERSION string that the software used to send that attack has
to freenode admins, so the attackers will have trouble getting on int he
first place
[17:30] <relle> so is the issue of ops in the channel now dead?
[17:32] <tunicwriter> We need something in place, I think (not that my
opinion is worth a great deal). Matt isn't always there, so therefore
there's no op there if someone gets particularly... "impolite," as
masq|lappy put it...
[17:33] <photomatt> okay let's move on


Last but not least... some ideas...

That page hasn't changed much since last year (July 24, 2005).

As someone who provides almost daily support to WP newbs via
#wordpress, I couldn't agree more with the need to address the lack of
ops. I'm happy to provide support to encourage new WP users, but I'm
only willing to do this via IRC as I find the slow response time of
forums and mailing lists to be too time-consuming. The increase in
meaningless crap in #wordpress does make this more frustrating and can
scare off people who are unlucky enough to be new to both
WP/html/css/php AND irc.

To the point: Give Michael Hampton (io_error) ops power.
He's in there far more than anyone else and he provides what is
currently the most used/useful bot(error_bot). By "in there the most"
I mean actually active and reading the stuff that comes through, not
just leaving a headless b0xen connected to the channel at all times.

Sure, he's a little power mad and self-admittidly "an arrogant
blogger" [ ;) ], but he is always in there solving peoples' problems
and won't take any crap.

I've been moderating forums for years and I don't see anyone else in
there who appears a better fit, nor more likely to do a good job, than
Michael.

Ok, Matt says that the #wordpress IRC isn't for support... Then why not 
give control of it to someone who is an active member, and then he/she 
can take steps required to purge trolls.. Just because it isn't for 
support doesn't mean that people don't ask for help or come their.. this 
has been said many times before, but it seems Matt is most unwilling to 
op anyone besides himself, and he not being there any time, there is no 
hope for #wordpress..

imho, I think this time around, Matt will look into the issue more closely.
I'm 99.9% convinced that he is going to consider designating selected
individuals for opage status, specific to the issue at hand. We'll just have
to wait and see for his response. Anyday now! :)

Just for the record: not everyone uses wp-plugins repo. Actually, I dare say more than 50% of the plugins in use today _aren't_ in there, but I could be wrong... I say go for it though, backwards compatibility isn't always the right way to go, and all it takes is but a one-word change to get a broken plugin working again. 

Good luck!

This is the perfect example of something that cannot be handled by a 
channel op effectively. Serious trolls, people with botnets, etc need to 
be handled on the Freenode level otherwise it's like irritating a wasp 
with a piece of paper.

On the social side, however, I agree. io_error seems like a good 
candidate for an op on the channel, I'm open to other suggestions. 3 
regulars seems like a good number.

I think people who are ops should only "op themselves" when needed to 
not create a hierarchy in the channel, which is the core of what has 
been characterized as my no-op bias.

There are several other people who have ops on the channel, they're just 
not regulars anymore, hence the need for new folks.

Also to clarify my "no #wordpress support" position, it was generally 
decided a while back that sending IRC-newbies into #wordpress with the 
expectation that they would get questions answered immediately is a bad 
idea. We positioned it like that for a bit, but it just annoyed people 
who were there to chat and disappointed people looking for support.

Furthermore, the forums seemed like an infinitely better support medium 
since they're threaded, archived, searchable. People familiar with IRC 
etiquette can and do help other folks on WP issues on the channel, but I 
think anyone who regularly hangs out there understands it tends to be 
more of a social place than a technical one. (Support could be partially 
addressed by creating a new channel, like #wordpress-support.)

....In summary, ops shouldn't be considered 'better' than other users, they should only use their privileges when necessary, and only then. IRC is not _officially_ a support group, but that doesn't mean you can't give support there. We will have 3 'not-op' ops, Michael Hampton is most likely the first - bring your suggestions....

All in favor say 'Aye'

This sounds like a good idea. We need to ensure this covers all
timezones effectively.  I am quite willing to step up to the task if
other do not want the responsibility, and would second the nomination of
ioerror, -  I have recently returned to spending more time in channel
after regaining ssh access to my server from work.

This is definetley necessary to maintain the friendly feel of the channel.

Still, having ops to keep the amount of links to GNAA scare tactics
pages or similar while a freenode admin is being contacted is better
than allowing the active users to be exposed to that kind of garbage.
At least with ops the amount would be decreased greatly and the rest
of the IRC users get the image that something is being done.

This brings up a question I asked once before but didn't get an  
answer to. I don't use 'wp-plugins repo'. I don't even know what you  
are referring to. But yes - it just takes a 'small change' most often  
to get things working in a new version. My question (before) and now  
is - where does one get informed of these changes so that we can be  
prepared...?

Yes, but it also could be argued it's why they won the hearts of 
developers over Apple in the early 90s.

+1. As far as nominations go, I'd nominate io_error, myself
(tunicwriter), and leftjustified (I see him around a lot as well,
giving help, as he said he does earlier in this thread).

Getting really OT (but that's nice :-) here, but that doesn't seem to be the real reason...
Early 90s there was DOS, Windows 3, and Windows 95.... technically they all had the same kernel.
DOS -> Windows 3.1: The GUI was introduced. Same kernel.
Windows 3 -> Windows 95: GUI redone. Same kernel.

Technically the kernel changed between 'Windows 1.0' and Windows 3, but for the most part it was just focused on mindless expansion (well, not mindless, actually it was great..), but nevertheless it focused on bringing new features instead of refining the old.

Anyway, all that is made moot by the internet. Now you can have developers subscribe to a (non-existent) RSS feed and be informed of changes to the structure as it happens. WP is open-source: they can use the SVN and hack their plugins to work on all versions before the public get it. WP is free: people don't have a _real_ reason not to leave 1.5, just lazy... hell, you could include a 'auto-upgrade' button in the dashboard that DLs the latest version of WP and installs it all on its own...

Things have changed, and WP is with the times. MS held back, they didn't use the new technologies that could have kept them the developers but helped them move on. It hurt them. Badly.

I couldn't agree more.
You can ban a user while the issue is being escalated.
It's better than having 6 pages of scrollback filled to the brim with
expletives and other childish nonsense.

No: Channel ops are not the food chain, but they keep the junk down.
Yes: They should exist for matters that can be helped or at least
temporarily prevented.
If the issue cannot feasibly be stopped (mass clone attack), then lilo
& co. will already be on top of it.  The more meager targeted attacks
however, are different.

CG> but that doesn't seem to be the real reason...

I'm in the middle of another similar discussion on the ZTree support forum
because a guy there has a bunch of stable Win95a machines and a feature
introduced to Ztree yesterday requires a DLL that was released as part of
IE4 in 1997. (http://www.ztw3.com/forum/forum.cgi?read=80424) He doesn't
want to update his machines and is asking the lead developer (Kim) to add
extra version check for a SHELL32 release from 9 years ago.  It's odd that
backwards compatibility should come up again here, on the same day.

Guru, you must be too young to remember the early days when you had to keep
a 5 1/4 for DOS 5 (for the newest programs) and one for Dos 3 (so that you
could still run your favorite programs).  The newer games (err... apps)
would run under DOS 5, but surely would not run under DOS 3.1.  Some even
required IBM PC DOS specifically (and/or that bit of BASIC built into true a
IBM PC's EPROM) and would never accept Compaq DOS.  

An expensive ATI Sound card that was worthless for Windows 3.1 because the
3.0 drivers would not work on 3.1 and there was no such thing as a generic
sound card driver.  And of course Windows 3.1 would not run under DR DOS.
Oh and you had to have 1 more disk for DOS 2 so you could play Wolfenstein
which only worked on DOS 2 and apples (hang on.. OK HERE:
http://www.thecodecave.com/images/CW5_25.jpg.  At #629 my disk was pretty
low in the run. I wonder how much it is worth?  And I still have the DOS
version needed: http://www.thecodecave.com/images/CWDos2_5_25.jpg).  Let's
forget the "True Compatible"/"100% compatible"/Clone/Tandy backwards
compatibility issues. But I will mention the backwards incompatibility
issues introduced by the PC Jr, the 80286 and the PS/2s each of which lopped
of huge chunks of earlier software and each of which were considered
failures as platforms.

All of this was nothing new and Apple and the new thing called a Mac were no
different.

It was only when the 80386 came out and the 80486 was largely backwards
compatible, that the PC started making real strides into the consumer market
and making up the loads of lost ground in the war against Apple and the C64.
With MAC, even though it was popular, you had to scrap a lot of your work
with every new machine/OS that came out.  With the PC, you didn't have this
cost.  The killer stroke was when 95 said (and actually achieved) "I will
handle all communication between you and the hardware.  You don't need to
talk directly to any of memory/video/hardware."  (3 tried to do this too but
largely failed)  That not only meant that you no longer need to care if a
Trident 8900c separates even and odd image rows in its memory while a Tseng
Labs card did not.  It also meant that the OS could allow programs to be
backwards compatible to old hardware like the Trident 8900 and Diamond
Stealth which still work under XP.

The non-butchered form of Occam's razor, "entities should not be multiplied
beyond necessity", applies here.  Matt's right that Microsoft made life
easier for the developers and the users alike by telling each of them "You
don't have to change what you are doing".  They did the same thing by going
multilingual.  Like rivers and electricity, the masses go where there is the
least resistance.  Occam's razor doesn't show you the BEST or RIGHT
solution, just the solution that will win out most of the time.

I +1 this particular issue, but think that in general backwards
compatibility IS a very important concern.  How many blogs out there still
run 1.2 despite the holes, because the admin didn't want to scrap their
theme to run 1.5 or 2.0?  I should say that I think that the WP PTB (powers
that be) do a good job of leveraging all of this.  They keep WordPress on
the right track.

Huh?  The Mac OSes were the most backward and cross compatible things in the 
world.  I used to have an external HD that I could boot pretty much any Mac 
with, great for tech support, lemme tell you.  Apps very rarely didn't work 
as the OS progressed (at the least in the more modern 6/7/8/9 range, let 
alone many working on OSX in compatability mode), or the chips changed 
(68K -> PowerPC, yet PPCs could run 68K code -- and the same goes today for 
IntelMacs running PPC code...).

As for Windows 'winning the hearts of developers', it had nothing to do with 
OS transitions, and everything to do with market share and med-to-big 
business spending habits.  Come on.  In fact, I know many windows devs that 
moved to the Mac because they were sick of many things going on with the OS 
development and lack of improvement over large spans of time.  Heck, Vista 
looks to be dissapointing.  I'm not a linux guy, and even >I'm< interested 
in some of the new tech coming down the pike...

If I had the money, I'd be working on an IntelMacBook Pro, with a minimum of 
three OSes but primarily working under OSX, and plugged into a 30" Cinema 
Display, with bluetooth mouse and keyboard. ;)  And this new funky Logitech 
input device that just came out...

Hmm if that's true, I stand corrected.  I was under the impression that
Apple OSs & hardware were so tightly tied that backwards compatibility was
considered a non-concern in that era.  I guess I formed that opinion largely
during the switch between the Apple ][ series and Macs. But I did think that
it continued with the switch between the Mac, the Mac II and whatever
hardware platform System 7 was introduced on.  Am I wrong on that?  The
software was largely interchangeable on those systems?

Before you do that, I'd like to point out with regards to the original
"delete_user" hook and backwards compatibility, that it seems to me
that there are very few realistic plugin scenarios that will be hurt
by the change, supposing there are plugins out there actually using
the hook.

So perhaps a dev could commit the patch?

Message-ID: <003a01c6a9f7$4229a6c0$c67cf440$@net>

I?m finally getting around to doing what I?ve always wanted, and that?s churning out the plugins.

My webserver supports the phps extension as highlighted php code. It takes the PHP and formats it as colored HTML. You can copy and paste the code just fine to a new document to create your plugin.

 

Now my question is, is this the ?preferred way? or is it more preferable to save it as plain-text files that can be downloaded straight to the plugins directory?

 

For example, http://neosmart.net/downloads/software/WordPress/Plugins/CompleteRSS.phps

It?s a _lot_ easier on the eyes, but if anyone were to save the target and upload, it wouldn?t work since it?s formatted HTML, not PHP.


What?s the right way?

Snazzy. I say it's a keeper. You may want to put an interface around it to
copy the code, explain what it's for, etc (and so people don't try and just
save it), but I say snazzy.

Well, anyone copying code from the internet _should_ be pasting into a plain
text editor or IDE... which isn't going to copy HTML formatting.

But to answer your question, I prefer plugins to be .php files zipped up. I
don't want to work. I'm lazy like that. Give me a zip or a tarball that I
can open and drag the files to my SFTP client and I'll be happy.

I'd tend to think most people are like me in this regard, but I can only
speak for myself.

I use the Installer plugin which does have problems with the .phps
extension. Ususally if there's a download link for the script in the
highlighted code which serves it as application/octet-stream and as
plain text then I can use that.

I also tend to use File > Save Page As a lot and it tends to break
things with the highlighted code. I usually have to do a re-download
using good ol' Copy & Paste to get things working.

I would think that a (g)zipped version (or a script to do it for you

You speak for me. I also sometimes do the wget/unzip dance straight from 
my server.

Either way, definitely go with a zip.

Sorry, to clarify: it doesn't have any problems with the actual
extension or MIME type. Just the formatting HTML, like you said,
stuffs it up.

I prefer using a download manager that lets me do ?dl=file.php and
serves it up as a plain text file with the .php extension when saved.
Because I do this, I know that someone requested and got support for
using files like this in the Installer plugin, and so I personally
enjoy it because it saves me a step with zipping up plugins and the
user a step unzipping.

Well, I *hate* when people do this with single files, because it means
I can't just read the code in the browser if that's all I need. Worse,
since I have to unzip the thing, I can't copy + paste straight to an
in-browser text-file editor on the server, like, in this case, the
plugin editor.

That said, the built in .phps syntax highlighting isn't great. PHP's
highlighter can't distinguish between full pages and inline use so it
won't produce valid documents. (No html, head or body elements, let
alone doctypes and what have you.) If you roll your own highlighter
instead you can include a download link that gzips on the fly.

Subject: [wp-hackers] SVG Kubrick Source
Message-ID: <44BC3064.4050309@mauveweb.co.uk>

After installing Wordpress for the first time recently the first thing I
did was look around for a vector graphics source for the kubrick theme,
so that I could tweak it a bit.

After a long search I found Michael Heilemann's site which has a .zip
file which contains a .psd source image. Which The Gimp can't open
properly. And which wouldn't be very flexible for me anyway.

So I set about recreating the assets for Kubrick from scratch in Inkscape.

This was of use to me so I hope it might be of use to others:

http://mauveweb.co.uk/misc/kubrick/kubrick_source.svg

It's not pixel perfect but it's pretty close; it is almost
indistinguishable to me. Note that all the assets should be replaced by
ones produced from the SVG for best effect.

The colours were picked from the JPEG assets shipped with Wordpress. The
dimensions of all the elements exactly match, and the radii of the
rounded corners are as close as I could get them. The one big stumbling
block is that Inkscape only has experimental support for Gaussian blur
at the moment, which might improve the drop-shadow significantly. At the
moment it is implemented with overlapping partially-transparent
rounded-rectangles.

I believe it should work in most SVG-capable vector graphics editors,
for example Adobe Illustrator. But I haven't tried that. Being SVG it's
a lot more portable than PSD and much more editable than JPEG.

There's also a (probably Debian/Ubuntu-specific) bash script which
rasterizes the SVG with Inkscape and slices it with ImageMagick to
produce the required JPEG assets, and a directory containing the sliced
images this produces:

http://mauveweb.co.uk/misc/kubrick/

In the long term, yes, Freenode needs to be involved.  But I can't 
describe how frustrating it is to get a hold of a freenode staffer in a 
good amount of time - last time I tried when #wordpress was trolled, it 
took about 5 minutes of flooding to get a hold of someone who could 
actually do something, and I think in the end it turned out to be lilo.

We _need_ an ops dude in there to temporarily +m until a freenode 
staffer can be contacted, or +b if it's an isolated troller.

Let me also note, that I have been asked by freenode staffers to not
involve them with some of the issues in the #wordpress channel in the
past that obviously need attention. A single troll posting nasty links
was one example, where a freenode staffer asked me (albiet politely)
to leave those sorts of things to the channel administrators, since
such actions aren't quite naughty enough to earn a server or
network-wide ban.

That's a really well written post. I'm going to pop a comment on there later
if/when I have some time. It's clear you've got a good understanding of how
the "business" end of things work in the tech world sometimes. I agree with
many of your points on the backwards compatibility issues. MS (which is a
whole different subject, and as I mentioned, I'd like to post a comment on
that later, but not here), has clearly made a number of mis-steps both in
terms of how they've dealt with their desktop OS, as well as development
platforms/server systems.

Anyway, in relation to WP, I'd think that worrying about being 'backwards
compatible' isn't nearly as important as doing something the best way
possible. The fact that WP is a 'community' based and supported product
liberates us to a great extent from needing to worry about much else than
doing things the best way they can be done. Following this thread from the
beginning, really illustrates quite clearly the point that everyone here
puts a good deal of thought and consideration for future impact into every
detail, as much as possible, so thanks ! I think that kind of effort should
be commended, and is a good part of what makes WP so great.

That's pretty unfortunate. I know some other projects have left 
Freenode, but I like their stated philosophy. io_error and masquerade 
have been set up with proper access, feel free to continue to send me 
suggestions off-list, someone in a non-US timezone would probably be good.

Despite this thread, a few folks seem to have already moved to another 
channel, which coincidentally might help some of the aforementioned 
maturity problems. When I look now #wordpress has 143 nicks in it, so I 
don't think there is any worrying changes and I think we can put this 
issue to rest.

BTW, if something is in the wp-plugins repo, it's easy to get both. 
People can link (or svn:external) the repo directly for plain-text 
version suitable for wgetting, and regular folks can have the 
automatically generated zip. (Which we have for tags now, too.)

I'll be sending out a lot of wp-plugins logins later tonight, finally 
found the prob with the repo creation that was preventing new accounts.

Stats....
The only reason I host my WP stuff locally is so I can see all kinds of numbers and figures. At the very, very least, does wp-plugins tell me how many people DL'd my plugin?
If it does, I'll switch _right_ now.

my personal preference for plugins is to download a zip or gz file which
creates it's own directory called "plugin_name", containing all of the
required files, etc for that plugin. my personal "work style" is such that I
like to keep things pretty organized (which isn't easy for me), it's too
easy to let code containing files get out of control. I keep a
/home/myusername/sw directory on my primary unix dev box at my co-lo
provider, inside of sw, I have a /wordpress, a /typo3, /crm etc. then in
something like the /wp folder I have a /core and a /plugins, then inside of
/plugins there's a /plugin_name for each one. Then at home/office I keep a
similar/identical setup on a nas box, except that I keep one extra set of
everything which is the "clean"/unmodified originals. I can see why some
folks prefer the single .phps style though, as that is really quick easy way
to get things done. I primarily jump through my personal hoops because we
normally have multiple version/edits of things for multiple clients, etc. so
it's really more of a management issue than one of the best or easiest
methods for the purposes of a WP plugin "standard".

Subject: [wp-hackers] phps for plugins

I'm finally getting around to doing what I've always wanted, and that's
churning out the plugins.

My webserver supports the phps extension as highlighted php code. It takes
the PHP and formats it as colored HTML. You can copy and paste the code just
fine to a new document to create your plugin.

 

Now my question is, is this the 'preferred way' or is it more preferable to
save it as plain-text files that can be downloaded straight to the plugins
directory?

 

For example,
http://neosmart.net/downloads/software/WordPress/Plugins/CompleteRSS.phps

It's a _lot_ easier on the eyes, but if anyone were to save the target and
upload, it wouldn't work since it's formatted HTML, not PHP.


What's the right way?

Hi,

I just downloaded the latest SVN and noticed that the advanced link  
management system, which made managing links in WP so powerful, had  
shrunk into one link category called 'Blogroll'  I was actually  
hoping to see subcategories introduced to the link system, but  
instead I found out that you guys downgraded it. I understand the  
motive to make WP as simple as possible to manage as it's being used  
by lots of novice users, but deleting features isn't the answer,  
WordPress is a power tool like none other, with it's great  
flexibility, WP is one of the easiest to customize and is used by  
pros to create more complex sites. I would like to ask the  
developers, Please reconsider this. You can keep it simple without  
getting rid of power features.

Thank You.

They already did. The link system _is_ more powerful now, just has fewer categories by default. In the trunk builds, you can completely create a link hierarchy from the dashboard, _way_ more powerful than before. It's not big by default, but it's definitely expandable user-side.

There are still categories for links, though :/ They've been merged with 
regular categories (a fairly controversial decision!) but they still exist.

Not, in the latest SVN in which there only seems to be one category,  
named "Blogroll" and no apparent way to add categories. quote (wp- 
admin): "Here you add links to sites that you visit often and share  
them on your blog. When you have a list of links in your sidebar to  
other blogs, it?s called a ?blogroll.?"

Blogroll categories and post categories have been merged. You add a _post_ category, and you can add links to it.. eugh... but it works.

Hmm, Interesting concept... Though It'll only let you add links to a  
category if you created it through the blogroll admin, and even then,  
if you edit it from the regular category admin (I tried making it a  
sub category of "blogroll") you can no longer use it for links, So  
it's actually 2 separate kinds of categories listed together. quite  
confusing I must say.

>quite confusing I must say. 
All of this is of Ticket #2499 (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2499), I
believe.

Ryan describes the goal for the rewrite here:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2006-March/002274.html

Personally, I like the change and think it will be beneficial.  I like the
idea of adding a link and then being able to easily post in the same
category saying the link is there.  I could even see a plugin that adds that
ability directly from the Post screen.  Then you could write a message
reviewing something  (a blog, a site, hardware or software) and add it to
your "blogroll" in the same action.  

So, imho, removing the table is not just normalization for normalization's
sake.  However, I do think calling the whole thing a "blogroll" is going to
be a source of confusion.  Links, WordPress Bookmarks if you must, are used
for way more than A blogroll.  The blogroll link category on my site is the
least used of the link categories.  Most of my link categories have nothing
to do with other blogs.  I don't think I'm a sole exception in that area.

The reason for changing the name as that the term links is used too many
places in WP.  I just don't agree that the term "links" is used too much for
this concept to be called links as well.  It's not overloading the term to
call "hyperlinks" "links" and that's all these are.  In any case, calling
the editor Blogroll, singular, is just going to confuse people.  People are
used to thinking of the blogroll as only the list of blogs and not of the
entire contents of the links widget.  If we are stuck on choosing another
term, please consider making the name plural in order to eliminate this
confusion.  So, "Blogrolls" would be somewhat more accurate and would show
that you can still add categories.  It will give the user the clue to look a
little further.

The problem, as I pointed out, is that the different types of  
categories are listed together but actually behave differently, so  
it'll just bring more confusion. while you can post to a link  
category, you can't link to a post category, but there's nothing in  
the category list indicating if it's a link category of post category.

I've found that it's best to just go ahead and provide three formats: 
phps, plain text, and a zip file. The phps is great for online viewing. 
The text file is good for most power users, who will just "Save as..." 
from their browser. And the zip is useful for people who feel more 
comfortable with a more "standard" download procedure.

A category can be used either way.  Right now, if a category only has 
posts, it won't be listed on the link add screen.  If you type the name 
of an existing category name in the Category->Add box on the link 
add/edit screen, that category will then appear.

Part of Mr. Kaplan's confusion is from the fact is that 2.1 says that there
is no such thing as "link category" yet the code is acting as if there is.

If categories ARE categories ARE categories, shouldn't they act the same on
all the screens and all be listed in the category box?

If you want to keep the concept of link categories, then add a key field to
the table that says which CategoryType, each category is.  Otherwise, they
can't be the same AND different without confusing the users.  And yes that
means adding hierarchy support to links/bookmarks/the blogroll whatever.

There are categories that contain links, categories that contain posts, 
and categories that contain both.

We filter them to accommodate those who don't want to see cats that are 
used only for posts on their links screen.

On Manage->Categories, a dropdown filter might be nice.

Show categories that contain [Posts|Links|Posts & Links]

Perhaps something similar on the category selection box in the edit post 
and link pages.

Is this what's causing the following error when I try to co a copy of
WP from svn:

whois is registered to nuclearmoose, and expired two days ago.  he (or

Something's strange as when I pull it up over at enom:

http://www.enom.com/domains/whois.asp?DomainName=wp-plugins.org&submit.x=55&submit.y=3

It's listed as being expired along the top.

Even though they have an expire date of 2007.

I wonder if enom is autorenewing domains that have expired and doing
it in the name of their customers.  That's what they did with the
*.infos when they were free a few years back.

.org is (a) official. (b) hosts SVN for a few hundred plugins, and
more for the developers
.net is more for the end users.

Ouch!
Those of you that can't see it run
Ipconfig /flushdns 
In the command prompt, but yeah, that explains everything.

Akismet is included in the SVN via svn:externals, which basically grabs it from another URL.

I'm thinking it's not the domain that expired though - too many domains at once. More likely there have been some server-side changes.

Seriously, somebody should tell somebody.

I think the .net site is an independent thing done by Dr. Dave (
http://unknowngenius.com/blog/), and isn't an "automattic" project or
however you want to put it. It's more for finding and sharing plugins, not
for SVN-based development and what-have-you.

LOL I was just going to ask if someone still had the IP address, and if so
if they could post it.  

The IP address could be used till the domain name is sorted out.

If someone can still see the site, before you flush your dns cache, ping
wp-plugins.org from the DOS prompt (or whatever) and let us know the IP
address!

Yep. I love this trick. Edit c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts or
/etc/hosts with:

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx wp-plugins.org
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx www.wp-plugins.org

And its off to the races. :)

I would bet that you could do ping trac.wordpress.org and come up with
the same IP address, but that's just a guess ;-).

Yeah, I think the domain must not have been renewed, or some other
domain-related problem is going on. I don't know if there's an escalation
process for this kind of thing, but somebody should tell somebody or
something :)

The domain apparently expired. I thought Craig had transferred that 
domain but obviously not, I sent him an email this morning but haven't 
heard back yet. If it's going to take more than a day or so, I can setup 
everything again on a subdomain of wordpress.org or something.

Perhaps this is a good time to switch over to plugins.wordpress.org or
something like that anyway. The less domains to keep track of the better, I
would think.

Hmm, I think that would be a better place for a end-user plugin
directory, not the dev stuff.

So to accommodate and minimize confusion to some, you end up  
confusing the others. may I propose adding some sort of indicator in  
the categories list, allowing a user to turn on/off links in that  
category in a simple manner?

I'd rather just have a "Show all categories" button in the cat select 
box on the edit post and link screens.  By default, the edit link screen 
  shows only cats that have a link already assigned.  If you want to use 
a category not listed, right now you can type the cat name in and hit 
"Add" to make it show in the list.  Adding a "Show all" button would 
save some typing when selecting an already existing cat.  Note that once 
a cat has a link assigned to it, it will show in the default list.

In our observations, users rarely bother with Manage->Categories.  They 
create new categories via the on-the-fly "Add" button on the edit post 
and edit link pages.  Once a category is added via "Add" and assigned to 
a post or link, it will show up in the appropriate list from there on 
out.   If someone wants to use the same cat for both a post and a link, 
they simply do separate Adds as they create posts and links. It's all 
done inline with the primary tasks -- creating post and links.  The 
downside is that Add requires JS.  Having a non-JS means of showing all 
cats in the cat select list would be nice.

Sounds like a great solution. It's not only about saving time, It's  
also about giving the user the assurance that he's adding to an  
existing category and not creating a new one.

I think we get enough people requesting we hack via this list, I can
only imagine what'd happen if we had a whole website about hacking
;-).

I'm of the understanding sub-domains on wordpress.net are intended for
official WP related bits...? eg: themes.wordpress.net
Would it not make sense to have the official plugin repo at
plugins.wordpress.net ?
Considering wp-hackers subscribers can get confused between
wp-plugins.org and wp-plugins.net, what hope do newbs have? (Oh, won't
someone think of the newbs... ;)

Nope, ideally, end users wouldn't have to see the repository with trac
et al at all, so it makes better sense to have it at plugin-dev or
similar, since when you visit themes.wordpress.net you're not greeted
with trac and subversion information.

For what it's worth, I've completely deleted my wp-comments-post.php
file (as I use my comments preview plugin that circumvents it
anyways), with no noticeable decrease in the amount of comment spam
caught by SK2 and Akismet, so the spambots must mainly be submitting
to the form action, no matter what it's named.

Message-ID: <44BE11B1.3000102@phunky.co.uk>

Hey guys, im trying to make some of my basic WordPress functions a bit 
more cache friendly, but i have a feeling that because my dev server is 
on a Windows box its having a bit of trouble working properly.

Can someone explain how the cahce works? i can push the data needed into 
the $wp_object_cache Object with ease, but it does not seem to keep it 
there.

I cant seem to figure out how to actualy save settings to the cache for 
the full expire limit, it just seems to be in $wp_object_cache for the 
time you init the page load.

I basicly wish to cash the full list of users on my website as i use 
ther data alot and dont want to have to call MySQL everytime.

See: http://www.mem-gaming.co.uk/v2/index.php/profiles/

It takes ages to load the page and i think its down to the way i pull 
out the userdata as a whole.

To use the built in WordPress cache, you don't have to do anything at 
all. ;)

get_option() and all of those automatically use the cache. Just code as 
normal and avoid manual MySQL queries when possible. :)

Er, whoops, didn't read the rest of your e-mail and hit submit by accident.

To do what you want, I suggest querying them all and then storing them 
as an option in the database. When you fetch the option value (the 
data), it'll be pulled from the cache.

Check out one of my plugins for an example:

http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/clean-archives-reloaded/

It does basically exactly the kinda thing you're doing. Without caching, 
it does ~300 queries. With the caching of the output to one option, it 
cuts it down to just 2 or 3 and then with WordPress' caching on, it cuts 
it down to just one I believe. :)

Great stuff, that works well :) now i just need to hook into anything 
that update a users profile so that it updates the option :)

Arrr right i do kinda get what your saying now, i just thought it would 
be possible to just add to the $wp_object_cache->cache[users] that 
already gets set but i guess this is not stored?

I shall have a play with what you have suggested, it seems like a very 
simple way of doing it anyway.

Perhaps you need to enable the cache, which is now disabled by default.

The cache is enabled, i think its just down to me using Apache on 
windows - i have been able to do what i wanted now tho thanks to Vipers 
comments, will have to give it a proper test later on in the day on my 
live webserver to see if it caches it properly tho

Can we get an _official_ word on the SVN downtime (related to propfind of akismet plugin), and whether or not its related to the domain issue?

 

More importantly, until its back up, can someone with access to the SVN trunk _please_ disable it from the svn:externals list because its interfering with a lot of pure svn-driven sites?.

 

Thanks!

Yes it is. akismet is hosted in the wp-plugins.org svn

Or you could change you `svn up` command to `svn --ignore-externals up`

And the error will magically disappear

No, then I'd have a bigger problem. My 4 sites are run _solely_ off SVN.. No FTP, or anything.
For instance, on NeoSmart.net, I have WP via SVN, Gallery2, several small scripts, and most importantly, our own home-brew site (design and backend, which power our downloads and research sections).

Most of it is put together via svn:externals....

I hope you're using branches/2.0, and not trunk...

Trunk is getting more stable, but it *is* alpha code, at best.

I always use trunk :-D (well, ever since 2.0 came out)

Once a week or so I have to manually hack a PHP file to comment out a line or fix something, but it's OK for the most part.
I make my living on the bleeding edge (testing alpha programs, scripts, and operating systems for NeoSmart Technologies), so I'm used to things going belly-up on me.

I customized NST's WP-Cache, it now has 'snapshots' of different times, so if the PHP goes bad in an SVN upgrade, I just tell WP-Cache to use the 'static' code from earlier time for that particular page - but I don't have to do that too often.

I don't know if anyone said it before, but the devs do a great job keeping the SVN 'running' at the bare minimum ;-)

Actually, someone can correct me, but options caching and the wp 'object 
cache' are I think different beasts.  Options caching is built directly into 
the options system, whereas the object cache is made to cache more 'general' 
queries to SQL.

In any case, if you are on a shared server, don't enable the wp object 
cache.  It can actually hurt performance, and on some servers its 
functionality is 'broken' and it actually spikes cpu usage.  The object 
cache is IMHO only to be used on dedicated servers, by a coder/admin who 
knows what they are doing (and probably using one of the replacement 
implementations, such as memcached, APC, etc.).

First, I'm not sure why a "official" word is needed here, it has been
explained more than thoroughly in other threads

And they wouldn't get an updated Akismet (which is okay, there's no
updated Akismet to get, since no new code can be checked into that
repository. I'm not sure I understand what your fuss is about?

In my last reply I explained how it stops SVN from working on the _entire_ site in question once it runs into a 501 error. My entire site is SVN. Hence, I can no longer update my site.

The code is on your server already, svn --ignore-externals up will
checkout the latest wordpress code. For your plugins, the code is
there and working, you can wait to update it. A 501 error from an svn
up won't delete your files. Why a lack of being updated for 3 days
constitutes your whole site being broken, I still don't understand.

I'm not worried about WP. My entire site is put together with SVN (read my previous message).
I have things that _will_ break if not updated (namely, NST's in-house download script that we're working on just now).

But all that is moot, I have gone ahead and removed akismet from svn:externals on my own... its more for _other_ people that might have a SVN site like us..

This might help me if you can answer this:

Can --ignore-externals be fine tuned in some way to skip just one
external source?

Computer Guru wrote that he does his whole site, not just WP with
externals "I have WP via SVN, Gallery2, several small scripts, and
most importantly, our own home-brew site (design and backend, which
power our downloads and research sections)."

If he does ignore-externals, then his gallery2, small scripts and his
whole home-brew site will not be updated (along with Akismet).  I have
a similar situation here-- where WP is just part of a much larger site
that is pulled in externally. Using --ignore-externals does update WP,
but it means ignoring the rest of my site's updates too and
essentially ONLY updating WP...

For a site that is only WP, the ignore opt works fine

svn up your other files in the plugins directory individually.

It's not the plugins, it's the rest of the site, which actually comes
from three production teams on different servers. Very tedious. But I
guess breaking up the updating is the only option if I can't ride out
this downtime. Thanks.

I've been planning to write up a plugin to use as an example of using 
the object cache, but haven't had time to finish it up. I'm in the 
process of writing an article to explain it, and hope to post it soon.

Try this:

Be warned that I haven't looked at the content of this archive. Google cache
of wp-plugins.org does not appear to store the trunk at its original

Oh, really? I have it enabled on my shared account for viper007bond.com. 
It cuts the queries used in like half, so I thought it was good to have on.

I should turn it off?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Feature Suggestion - OneClick Installs
Message-ID: <69980e7f0607191943j16773dd4o1d0b3e1603432ea5@mail.gmail.com>

I have been playing with the Widget plugin and found that it finally
resolves one of the two major problems I have with WordPress. I've been
thinking about the other problem and I tried to hobble a solution together
but found that the time investment exceeded my freetime. Instead, I decided
to make a feature proposal I wasn't sure of the correct means to do so, so
bear with me as this may be rather long.

I will also be posting this to my blog at http://s1n.dyndns.org. For a
sample of the following, please refer to http://s1n.dyndns.org/onclick.xml and
http://s1n.dyndns.org/oneclick.txt

Installing plugins and themes have always been a sore spot with me. There
use to be a plugin database but it has become deprecated due to a serious
underlying design flaw. Here's my suggestion: all themes and plugins (any
really anything) should be installed, removed, and updated with a single
click. The flaw with the old plugin database was that the maintainer kept
track of the installing of the plugins when in fact the plugin/theme
developers should themselves do this.

To solve this, an EBuild style file will be downloaded. Similar to Gentoo
EBuilds, the file will dictate the location of the plugin's download and
will provide a function for installing and removing itself. This means that
WordPress developers will not have to maintain information about the
plugin/theme installs but rather the actual developer of said plugin/theme.
For example:

VERSION=1.1
SRC=http://some.url.com/plugin-1.1.zip
function install(){
   //php install code here
}

function remove(){
   //php remove code here, removes this plugin entirely

}

The install/remove functions will be called depending on what the user
chooses from the admin page. The admin page (check the sample) will have a
listing similar to the plugin admin page. In fact, much can be borrowed from
that. These EBuild style files can be downloaded and executed on the fly.
They can use PHP to keep them platform independent.

The next major thing is how these EBuild style files are to be propagated.
RSS seems like the best route here (refer to the XML sample). Note that the
samples are just debug tests; I'm sure a more creative use of RSS can be
devised. The sample plugin PHP code is also debug and is very inelegant. The
RSS can be used to define all of the plugin details and links to the EBuild
style file. This will also allow people to be notified when their plugin is
updated or new plugins are added.

If anyone has any questions about this idea, please ask. I think this could
be extremely powerful and useful, but I could be wrong (maybe there's
something I'm not seeing wrong). I am hoping someone else has the time to
implement this and fill in all of the holes.

Those solve the problem pretty well.  They would be good candidates for 
future integration into WP core, I think.  2.2 perhaps.

Keep in mind, however, that whatever method we choose won't work for 
everyone since working with files can be an ordeal in most hosting 
environments, especially when safe_mode is involved.

Whatever it is, it really needs to be in core, though.

I haven't played with this PVS system, but these seem to only address part
of the problem. This needs to allow the developers the installation, removal
and update procedures. The Installer plugin seems to have requirements as to
what can be installed and where it's installed. By using the Ebuild style
file, this allows the plugin developer themselves to define where the file
is and how to manage the installation of the plugin. The only thing that
needs to be maintained by WordPress is the RSS feed that keeps track of the
Ebuild style files and the versions. We could even borrow from RedAlt's idea
of having a system for the developer to update the plugin information (RSS
update).

It should be all encompassing and dead simple manage themes, plugins, and
widgets for vanilla installations.

+1 also. I think in this particular case we probably need to deal with
the fact that it won't work everywhere, and disable it where it won't.
This is far too useful to people without safe_mode.

I agree - especially since in the worst case scenario people would just 
have to manually install as they do now, so we're not really losing 
anything.

We already have activate and deactivate hooks, although putting them in 
an ebuild style file might have merit.

Such flexibility shouldn't be necessary.  Plugins that are installing 
outside of the plugins directory should be spanked and sent to bed.  Bad 
plugin!

I like the Installer plugin because it is fairly straightforward and 
doesn't try to do too much.  Plus, it is implemented and working.  But, 
grafting some of these ideas onto the installer might be nice.  Maybe 
Matt Read and Owen will weigh in with their thoughts.

Yes, but at the least if such a beast is being done, it needs to handle 
other files.  For instance, subfolders and subfiles a level below 
/plugins...

I never understood that - if you're paying for your shared hosting (anything over 5 dollars a month), why do you stay with a host that has safe_mode() on? I've been with over 80 or 90 hosts in my life, from $0.98 a month to $80 a month, and every single one had safe_mode() off.... with the proper permissions and security settings (that a decent program like CPanel will configure on its own), the worst safe_mode() being off can do is allow the user to fu- screw up his or her own account, something that the host technically has no right to stop them from doing so long as they keep paying.

There's plenty of really good and really cheap hosts that don't do safe_mode.

I agree that main-line WordPress plugins should be in the plugins directory.
But, if you are writing a plugin for TinyMCE, it has to be in the TinyMCE
directory, /wordpress/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/.  

For WPG2 (wpg2.galleryembedded.com), we install the main WordPress plugin in
the WordPress plugins directory, but the Gallery2 Image Chooser
(g2image.steffensenfamily.com) plugin for TinyMCE (which is included with
WPG2) has to go in the TinyMCE plugins directory because TinyMCE won't take
the plugin in another directory.  

(Unless I've missed an easy way to make TinyMCE accept a plugin in another
directory.  I've researched and experimented, but have not been able to make
it work any other way.)

I don't know for sure, but I imagine that the other visual editors like FCK
may have similar requirements.

Cheers,
Kirk

That's actually a flaw in the WP-Core. For _all_ intents and purposes, the WYSIWYG is a _plug-in_ and should be stored in the plugins folder - not in a WP-Core file/folder.

Agreed! One of the sorest parts for me is how the plugin paths are  
fixed to wp-content/plugins.  Theme locations can be changed (by  
filtering theme_root and theme_root_uri) as well as upload paths, but  
the plugins are fixed into the WP installation.

Also, with regard to the Installer plugin, it should be part of the  
base WP. One gripe is the requirement that the plugins and themes be  
in the proper 'directory structure', which isn't always true and the  
plugin (at least when I used it two months ago) severely breaks if  
this is not the case (which is more often than I'd like with some  
themes).

Yeah, that's bugged me too. It'd make my life WAY easier if it was a 
plugin as then it'd be easy as pie to not upload it when upgrading all 
of my sites.

Can we get the IP to the server so we can override the DNS while things

Fair point.  Let's see if we can add a way to have tinymce plugins load 
out of the plugins/ dir.  The problem with automated installs outside of 
a set area (plugins) is that the user must make even more directories 
writable by the webserver.

Hi,
I want to write a plugin (or does one exist?) that will let the site  
admin create static pages that can be viewed only by specific users  
(not user groups or levels, but individual users) the purpose if for

Somebody write a patch. The plugin directory cannot be pluggable in the 
manner that theme directories are (you have to find the plugins before 
you can load them so that they can change the plugin dir), but a 
constant defined in wp-settings.php would get the job done.  Maybe a 
wp_plugins_dir() func similar to wp_upload_dir().

Installing things to arbitrary locations means lots of writable 
directories.  Almost every plugin I've seen that installs outside of the 
plugins directory could be fixed to not need to go outside.

Minus plugins that are required to go outside, such as advanced-cache.
imho, this needs to be changed as well.

For the purpose of creating private or one-to-one areas on a blog, I
wrote a simple post access control plugin which could be adapted to work
with pages. Your request reminded me the code was stagnating on
localhost, so I published it. It's unpolished, but feel free to check it
out.

Looks like what I need. so If i want it to be password protected and  
visible only to user #7 I just enter this in the password field?   
'*whxv*7' ??? just making sure I got it right, and that there's no  
other actions necessary.

You have the syntax correct, to grant access to the user with ID 7, who
will now see the post and no longer requires a password for access.

The idea is, if you pass access control, there was no password and if
you don't pass access control, there was no post.

This is getting a bit off-topic here. I've seen a few people agree that this
is a needed feature but nothing more. Anyone interested in developing this
or should I keep chugging on this at an unbearably slow pace?

I'm not intimately familiar with the WP database design, but this _should_ work (and, no, it hasn't been tested, and I'm not responsible for any damage =P): 

$wpdb->query("SELECT post_id FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_status = 'static' AND post_title = 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'");

And this will return an array with exactly 0 or 1 members, depending on whether or not such a match was found.
post_title is obviously the name of the page, and static tells it to look for _pages_ not posts. The array will have one member: post_id, which is the page id, and you can use that to do anything else you are interested in.

Hope this helps,

Sounds like a neat idea, but it would require theme editing, and is a  
niche feature, so it wouldn't make for a good core addition.

You could also use the category description field for storing the  
category description if it's not worthy of having its own page (that  
is, display it on the sidebar for that category or something.)  Make  
sure you apply the appropriate content filters to it, so you get  
paragraphs and curly quotes.

Won't work. Try using $wpdb->get_var, $wpdb->get_results, or one of
the other $wpdb->get_* functions. Query just returns the number of
rows selected/modified by the query.

I stand corrected. I had just searched the codex for DB design and copy and pasted the variables into a standard MySQL query... I had no idea what the query() function even did... ;-)

However, the query itself is OK.

Why not just create child-pages as content and then have the parent-page

Well, I'm just thinking aloud here...
But, a post is technically for 'dated' content, articles, etc. and a page is for something 'stock' that will be there at all times and generally isn't 'content' per say.

It doesn't need theme modification, it would be a normal page, that's always there, but when you navigate into a category, if a page is _not_ in that category, it wouldn't show....

I'm thinking of the Widgets bar actually... It has a bunch of fields that are wonderfully context-aware (like latest posts displays posts from the category only), and so the pages widget would also change to reflect the category.

For instance: 
Categories:
|Software
..|WordPress
.....Plugins
.....Hacks
..|Moveable Type
|Hardware
..|Processors
..|Mobos


Now each of these categories has _posts_ that discuss a particular mobo, cpu, plugin, etc.
Each _category_ has a _page_ with relevant links, shopping sites, tips on plugin writing, etc.

These pages will show at all times on the homepage or not, depending on your theme. But when you enter a category, you _should_ (via a widget or theme) be able to specify that _only_ pages _in_ this category should show....

SELECT post_id FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE status='static' AND $wpdb->category = current_category

Only problem is, current wp db structure _doesn't_ allow for category field with status = static...

See what I mean?

That's an interesting concept, and I'm actually working on something  
similar for a site, (each category has a bunch of unique static  
information on the archive page) But the general concept of pages are  
that they're separate from the blog posts, so mixing them into the  
post categories for no logical reason will just mess things up.

And if you have a site where you need it to appear as if some pages  
belong to post categories, some tweaking of the theme should do the  
trick.

See my reply to Mark Jaquith.

The whole reason for _not_ using customized themes is simple: it keeps things _outside_ of the PHP, so upgrades and updates can be done cleanly, and more importantly, it provides a navigation hierarchy for the categories w/ pages.

There is an email somewhere about tags vs. categories; the same logic goes here.

So what will be returned if you have two pages with the same title?

It'll return both.
It's up to the script (or plugin, or whatever, wasn't paying attention earlier) to decide what do with it.. It can either spit out only the first one, or list them all with a while () or foreach () command.

How about:

    $page_row = $wpdb->get_row("SELECT p.ID FROM $wpdb->posts p WHERE
p.post_status = 'static' and p.post_name = '$page_slug' ORDER BY
p.post_date DESC LIMIT 1");

I think the post_name (the slug) is unique, if not then the ORDER BY
p.post_date DESC LIMIT 1 should ensure you only get 1 row returned,
and that it will be the latest page with that slug.

Hope that helps,
Steve

Message-ID: <002201c6acce$ef307a90$0300a8c0@greenville>

the way/place to attack this depending on what you are trying to accomplish
specifically is either 
a) in your theme
b) with a plugin

if you're trying to achieve a "navigation hierarchy" - that's already pretty
straightforward using pages/parent pages. So, for example the easy way -- 
I'd change one of my menu's to read something like "SITE PAGES" - then
create a parent page for each "category" - then child pages beneath each.
that would be the "simple" way to accomplish the navigation/organization. 

if you needed your pages to be "tagged" with the same "category" tags as
posts, then it's time to take a look at the plugins that are out there
already, and if one won't do exactly what you need it to, then either hack
it or write a new one. 

if you were trying to do something like use different "themes" or .css files
for pages than posts, etc. there are plugins to help with that as well, but
I've also found that a couple of simple lines of php in your theme's
header.php file can be just as effective (like, if == page !post then use
x.css, etc).

How come posts can have categories, but not pages?

 

What if each category had a page that describes how to use it and what it's
for?

What I ended up doing is copying the whole 2 functions that deal with  
getting the page list, (wp_list_pages() and get_pages()) putting them  
in the theme's functions.php, renaming them, and changing the line  
that handles excluding pages to sort by 'post_name' instead of 'ID'.  
'post_name' , unlike 'post_title' is unique as far as I know.

But you never know: what if a plugin that use has come to the same conclusion, that it is unique for it too?

The best way to do it is stick it in a class or else pre-pend a random string before it.

I renamed the functions. What I was saying was that the 'post_name'  
column in the database is unique, unlike the 'post_title' column

A context aware wp_list_pages() might answer your first question as  
Computer Guru mentions elsewhere in this thread.  As to your second:  
you don't, but that has nothing to do with your third.

Consider the same situation with links now instead of pages.

Links have categories.  Links and post even *share* categories.
Currently, all links are displayed in WordPress' category view (this  
can be customized at the theme level).
Links do not fit into chronological listings of posts.
The point of categorization is to group similar links.

Sounds fine.  I think Page Categories make as much sense.  The  
annoying thing is figuring out how to deal with objects that have  
both hierarchy and categories.

+1 to Computer Guru's idea:
Add Categories to Pages
wp_list_pages() displays in the same way it does now (i.e. it does  
not display by category)
wp_list_pages() takes a new optional parameter: in_category=#ID

The tricky Part:
If we ask for a hierarchical listing and a child is in the requested  
category but the parent is not.  Do we
A: not display that whole section of the hierarchy (i.e. the child  
does not get displayed)
OR
B: display that whole section of the hierarchy (i.e. the parent gets  
displayed)
OR
C: Don't display the parent, do display the child and its children  
(i.e. 'move the child up' in the hierarchy)
?

Keeping in mind that in a flat, non-hierarchical listing, this issue  
does not come up except as a potential consistency problem between  
flat and hierarchical displays.

Good question: I say treat it the way we do categories themselves.
A child is _inherently_ a member of the same category as its parent. When you view the child, there should be a link _to_ the parent, but the parent itself shouldn't be listed there... Just my two cents.

(BTW, for everyone suggesting themes and plugins, _Why?!!_ This is the easiest and most logical way of doing it!!)

Any experts out there willing to fix the future posting bug in 2.1? In an
attempt to advance this bug to the priority list on your list of bugs to
fix, I'm willing to sweeten the deal a little w/ some money.

It's just the future posting is very important to some people and
unfortunately it's not too high on the priority list for most coders.

I'm currently using 2.1A2, but I understand it's still broken in the latest
svn.

here are three things posted on the bugtracker:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2715
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2737

Please do email w/ any more questions!


Thanks for taking the time to read everyone,

That will hopefully fix the stripping.  We were triggering the content 
filters when moving from future to publish.  Since any page load can 
trigger the cron event that does the publishing, the user that happens 
to trigger the publish may not have sufficient priviledges and invoke 
the wrath of kses.  Let me know how that works.  I'll look at the other 
issues too.

The other issue with CGI on Apache servers I still struggle to find a
solution for to this day. We could just go back to the iframe hack,
but its disgusting and could cause a page slowdown for a random
visitor, which I don't particularly like the thought of. Another
option proposed on trac is pinging an external site which will then
make a request to the cron file on the pinging site. It could be done,
but this brings up issues with trusting that the server will stay up
(perhaps it could fall back upon iframes so that nothing breaks). I'm
quite perplexed on how to do this on Apache as CGI... I hate broken
envs.

This is my first time looking at this bug, I have a question:
What are we doing that is different from the other blogs/forums/wikis/scripts that use cron jobs that makes ours break?

AFAIK, this is a standard script that needs to be executed, and should work with the default php cron interface...

Sorry!

Sorry, I meant php via the default cron interface.

What I'm thinking:
1. Do whatever it is we're already doing.
2. CGI? We're stuck, go on to step 3. Else Finish.
3. Require access to php exec().
4. Using exec() add an entry to the crontab.

Exec() is enabled on like 99% of all systems, even in safe mode.

The crontab listing would be calculated by subtracting time of publication from current time. Once the cron job runs, we use the exec() command to _delete_ that cron entry.

The way it would work is that every time wp-cgi-cron.php is accessed, it will query the db for to-be-posted entries, sort them by date of publication (ASC), then publish the first entry. It would then use exec() to delete that listing from the crontab.

I don't see why it shouldn't work.

It must obey safe_mode_exec_dir, I believe.  Plus, a number of hosts do 
stuff like this:

disable_functions = proc_open , popen, disk_free_space, diskfreespace, 
set_time_limit, leak, tmpfile, exec, system, shell_exec, passthru

We spawn ours out-of-band so that the user doesn't have to wait for it 
to complete.  Others kick their pseudo-cron off from an image tag or the 
like.

OK, can't we fall-back to pseudo image tags, or something? Or even make them wait.... I mean, it's worth it for the CGI users if one visit near the time of the publication is 2 or 3 seconds longer than normal. It's just _one_ time (right?), and in exchange their future-publication works....

So you can use it the way you already are, but if CGI is detected, fall back to this 'waiting way' and then from there to IFRAME.... foolproof, no?

About the cron jobs though - it _is_ the default for all CGI installations, isn't it? With PHP compiled into Apache, it's not always the default, but AFAIK, all CGI installations have it stock, no?

And IIRC, we're not using any of those commands you listed as being "blacklisted" on hosts, and safe mode exec _should_ only escape all commands in the strings associated... 
>From the PHP docs:

http://de2.php.net/function.exec:

Neither of these should inhibit a simple command like
$ 0 1 * * 0,2,4,6 /usr/local/bin/php /home/user/wp/mycron.php >/dev/null

Leaving us home-free.....

Processing pings can take a loooong time.

We might end up doing an iframe fallback if no other approach pans out. 
  I would really like to narrow down which environments should be 
blacklisted.  Not all CGI environments misbehave.

> About the cron jobs though - it _is_ the default for all CGI installations, isn't it? With PHP compiled into Apache, it's not always the default, but AFAIK, all CGI installations have it stock, no?

cron is a *nix thing.  We cannot rely on it being installed, running, 
and in the shell path.  If we could, all of the pseudo-cron 
implementations hanging about wouldn't be necessary.

Yes, safe_mode breaks pipelining, which is no big deal in this case. 
But if safe_mode_exec_dir is set, exec is pretty useless with safe_mode 
on, IIRC.

Its not the blog owner that has to wait, though. It is an unsuspecting
end user, who can be hit with 20-60 second wait times. Just search the
WP support forums for problems with posting taking a long time.

I think you're lost again. Nothing about CGI involves cron, and not
all CGI installations have the problem (whereas the old code that Andy
had did have issues with all environments. So far, the only
environment that has been reported as broken is Apache with PHP as
CGI. I personally use lighttpd with PHP as a fast-cgi module with no
issue at all.

_All_ exec related functions are often blacklisted, it is too much of
a headache for managing shared servers leaving anything like this
open, the potential for exploit is far too high.

WordPress should remain free of anything that involves using any exec,
it is simply not even close to being reliable across platforms,
especially windows and shared hosts, which make up quite a bit of the
user base.

I'm going to go _really_ off topic here, but _there_ are fixes for that, and that _is_ one plugin that should be incorporated as a WP fix in 2.1.

I completely forgot about this issue because I have this wonderful plugin installed, and though I ping 6 different RPC servers (the really slow pingomatic included!), posts take no time at all:

Whaddya know! You're the author of this plugin, Robert! http://somethingunpredictable.com/wp-no-ping-wait/

So, yeah, thanks for writing it :D, and if this is implemented in WP 2.1, the issue your talking about above _won't_ exist, and end users will (not) notice _milliseconds_ publish times.....

Seeing as you?re the author you should know that =P

Seeing as how I'm the author, I should know very well that this uses
the spawned execute-pings.php which can only run for the blog poster
after publish. When future posting, you have no guarantee that the
first person to visit after the future time will be the same person
who wrote the post, more likely it will be someone visiting the blog.
If we were to ping upon publish, we'd get a kickback from people who
found their blogs blacklisted from ping services for sending out pings
to 404s, and the same with search engines.

The thing is, the ping times still take just as long, even with that
plugin. Its a percieved time vs actual time issue.

Message-ID: <674b4a3b0607221956w165d1b38gcfdb8a88533093a6@mail.gmail.com>

I was just helping someone straighten out the styling on his WordPress
blog, where the problem in Firefox seemed to lie in his use of the
deprecated "align" attribute.  He pointed out that it was generated by
TinyMCE, which I'd never noticed (not being a big WYSIWYG user).

I'm not a standards Nazi, and I realize TinyMCE is an independent
project from WP.  But since right on the home page WordPress claims a
focus on web standards, we're talking about a deprecated attribute
that causes problems, and valid markup seems like an easy
substitution, is there nothing we can do?

The following change applied to trunk and branches/2.0 as part of the

Should this not be reverted?

Heh - Intercept the robots.txt calls via .htaccess sending the bot over
to a page that triggers the croned activities while still returning the
robots.txt info*.  Then no human admin or otherwise has to suffer the
time lag. The referrer could even be used to ensure that prefered search
engines (say Alexa which has a speed check) never triggers it.

Eh... Propably wouldn't be practical but it would put bots into actual
practical use...

*now either incorporated into WP or read via IE from robots.txt that
could still exist in the root web directory.

I like the thinking, but why not feed Akismet spammers into that tarpit
instead?  I get a nigh-consistent barrage of spammers pinging away at my
comment form, 99.995% of which get caught by Akismet.  Use the spammers
to fire your cron jobs and make 'em wait for the result.

Sorry to delurk for a moment... this is a great idea, but what is the 
consistency of spam requests to relatively unknown or new blogs?  Is it 
reliable enough that a cron scheduled process would run at accurate 
times?  And what about blogs with commenting disabled?

Or, do we use spam comment requests whenever we can, and if no spam 
requests come in on the schedule, default back to a normal web user's 
request?

Just throwing in my thoughts...

I was mostly kidding, although the same perils await new blogs if we
were to use the robots.txt method, as Google, et al. have to know about
a blog to index it in the first place.

Using wayward requests to things like favicon.ico, robots.txt or the
comments form might be a way to harness the "energy" of spammers and
search engines to make our lives a lot easier - think of it as applying
some thermodynamics to make everything work better.  Harness the
entropy, don't fight it!

Exactly! I didn't think of the spam idea since my newest blog is crawled way
more often than it is spammed - I'm sure that ratio will reverse itself -
but I like it - Especially tying it into an Akismet result, though that is a
plugin that is not always activated.  

And as long as we are being semi serious about this, I would not include
FavIcon requests in the list of triggers...but 404s Sure!

If we do revert back to a user triggered event (whatever tag is chosen),
should registered users (with saved cookies) be excluded?  Thus you would
get an additional benefit for being a registered used of each blog?

Also, RE: the 30-60 ping lag - Is there a way to further break this up?
Stop after 10 seconds (variable) and process the remaining pings after the
next trigger event?  Perhaps in some situations that would mean only 1 ping
is processed, but if we find a trigger that occurs often, no one will take
the whole weight of a 60 second ping process on their shoulders.

Not replying to any message in particular, but I have (what I think is) a better idea.
When _any_ user hits the site, and the time matches or around that of future post, trigger a _new_ script.

This _new script_ will then use CURL, Snoopy, FOpen, whatever you like, and get the _server_ to 'GET' the page in question, and letting the server itself bear the brunt of the ping delay.

This is off the top of my head, haven't had my coffee yet (that's a disclaimer =P), but shouldn't it work?

No, because this is what we do already, and wonderful Apache and its
broken glory won't allow this with PHP as CGI. Why? Who the hell
knows? Beats me.

The advantage of not triggering this for everyday users is that we avoid
the uncomfortable random long load times.  Force the "users" that are an
actual burden on your site into doing something useful - firing your
cron jobs and eating the load times so regular users don't have to.

Not suggesting this as a total replacement for any other solution, but
it could offload quite a bit from other avenues.

Triggering it for everyday users isn't the problem. Where it works,
the system already essentially forks off a seperate worker process to
handle everything without any delay whatsoever to the end user.
However, under Apache as CGI, we need to find a different work around,
and all of those that come immediately to mind will cause the delays.

Imho, the following things are wrong with some of the suggestions:
- The one about Akismet... Akismet is a plugin that relys on an
external service. I'd rather not have anything in the core rely on an
external service all the time. For example, even the reliance on
ping-o-matic as the default ping server was a bad thing when it was
taking 20-80 seconds for ping-o-matic to accept the pings.
-For search engine spiders, robots.txt, etc., or spammers, they are
simply too unreliable. A future scheduled cron even may very well be
triggered by any of them at any time, but we can't rely on only them
to do the pinging. Short of building some statistic analystics systems
in with the cron to detect whether or not another hit from a spammer
or search engine is likely to come within a short period of time after
the event is supposed to fire, there is no way for us to know which
sites can handle this kind of behavior or not.

Bah.  Maybe I'll write a plugin instead.  *grin*

There was a bug fixed at the beginning of 2005 where the tb_id wasn't 
being cast to an int.  That's the only one I recall.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Next/Previous Entries Link - 404 error
Message-ID: <00cd01c6af4a$cedc69b0$0300a8c0@greenville>

On a couple of sites that I have 2.0.2 installed, we've started having the
problem with the "previous entries" link at the bottom of the main/home site
page ending in a 404 error and linked to /page/2/ as discussed previously.
We haven't made any changes to the permalinks/structure, etc. We did however
change the reading options for the sites to either show "5 days only" or "5
posts only". That's when the problem started. On the sites in question we've
not previously encountered this situation. 

I know this has been discussed a couple of times both here and on the
forums, does anyone know the following:
1) approx. dates of mailing list discussion of this topic so I can go
research it myself
2) is/was there a trac ticket on this issue and if so what's the #'s. 
3) Short of me just removing the php for the link at the bottom of the pages
(which will do fine for my purposes with these sites) is there an easy cure
?

First, update to the latest stable, 2.0.3, or even 2.0.4 which is
pretty rock solid, and then let us know if the problem persists. Also,
this is better suited for the support forums.

As an aside - I wrote a script to scan  WP  and MT blogs on my server  
that have Akismet installed, detect the spammy IPs, and shunt  them  
into  the firewall. Very low  impact,  runs every 10 minutes, and so  
far  is  doing  a marvelous job. I  know  this  isn't  something that  
could  be built into  WP, but thought some folks here might be   
interested:

That's based on the CSF firewall for  cPanel, but could  be adopted   
easily to  work with  other firewalls.

Have you seen Bad Behaviour?
It's a plugin for WordPress that does just that, except instead of blacklisting the IPs themselves, it blacklists their _methods_ by blocking certain UAs, access to files, etc... all from WP itself.

Together with Spam Karma 2 (and it's own Akismet plugin for SK2), you can blacklist the IPs _and_ the methods of accessing the blog by spammers, _and_ take advantage of Akismet's spam filters.... bullet-proof (for now).

I see hundreds of /trackback/ and wp-comments-post.php POST requests
ever hour for the WordPress sites I host (have about ~210 or so) and
mod_security really helps immensely, and for the SPAM that does go
through, there's always Bad Behavior, Akismet and Spam Karma. like you
said, it's like a DDOS attack, none-stop across several hundred sites,
but that's reality. and being that someone responsible for those sites
mean, i have to ensure they're protected appropriately.

Message-ID: <ca7320070607241352x27d52b8fyeb2163d68cd8953c@mail.gmail.com>

Following on with a email discussion I started a few weeks ago about hooks
and Loops, I've completed what I set out to do (Thanks, Andy! Your
recommendation got me pointed in the right direction anyway), I've found
that after my plugin sorts thorugh the Loop and does displaying the way I
want it to on the blog, it also reorders the posts in Manage > Posts (
edit.php).  I'm using get_query_vars() in my plugin to sort through
conditions for displaying the Loop in different ways, but I realize there is
nothing that I can see to prevent the Loop in the wp-admin from getting
reordered. Of course, describing this is difficult without showing code so
here's just a brief bit of the code I have written into my function. In each
of these cases, the query is simply passed through unchanged. I don't know
if there's a way to add something to pass the query through unchanged if it
is called inside of wp-admin:

    if(get_query_var('s') ||
        get_query_var('search') ||
        get_query_var('p') ||
        get_query_var('name') ||
        get_query_var('pagename') ||
        get_query_var('page_id')
        ) return $query;

Scratch that. Adding is_admin() to the list of tests works fine for me.

FYI, my Outlook setting: Plain text, MIME (quoted printable) and using Unicode (UTF-8) for outgoing message.
My WP version is 2.0.1

First things first: upgrade. 2.0.3 is the latest stable, with many
bugfixes and security fixes. 2.0.4 is almost stable and has even more
bug and security fixes. After upgrading to one of those, see if your
problem persists. Also, this is better suited for the support forums.

this makes sense to me:

wptexturize and yes.

I normally just do:

+ Top
++ Sub
+++ Sub-Sub
++ Sub 2
+++ Sub-Sub 2
+++ Sub-Sub 3

although I hardly think it's a big deal.

That's a cool technique, but works on a per-blog basis. My "add to  
firewall" method protects all blogs on a shared server with 70+  
accounts, whether they're Movable Type or WP or other, and also  
reduces email spam in cases where the spammy IP is generating both  
weblog and email spam. Spam to one blog results in protection for all  
of them, with the lowest impact on server performance possible. I  
know  it's not for everyone, but works well for admins of shared  
servers.

Not to mention the responsibility of keeping server loads down, which  
IMO is even more critical than keeping spam out of individual blogs.

What happens if the IP is not static and is assigned by DHCP from an ISP to
multiple clients over a period of a month? Or, God forbid, the user is using
AOL and is being routed through the annoying AOL proxies, or simply behind a
regular proxy? Banning the IP could have long lasting detrimental effects,
donchathink?

Just a question.

Back to the topic at hand:

(Damn, I hate CGI!!)

Nothing is unfixable, and there is always a solution.. but in this case, I guess it's possible the solution needs to come from the guys at Apache :'(

I don't understand why a user has to be there to bear the brunt of a ping-wait.. but here's another idea (yes, I'm determined)

According to previous emails, what currently happens is the server GETs the page in question, and _it_ waits for the ping. That's the way it is on ISAPI php or non-CGI on Linux. But this doesn't work on CGI since servers can't wait or something like that...

I don't understand this: you say the problem is that in a PHP-as-CGI setup, PHP files can't grab files off the local server and wait for the ping to go through.

Fine. Do we have to do it via PHP? If we're doing it server-side, we can require that CGI users have perl or python or _something else_ installed, and spawn that instead... can't we? After all, CGI is terrible anyway.

Or if you want to do it server-side but don't want users to wait, can't we use AJAX to do this sort of thing? If you use an image tag, technically 
1) It's invalid HTML
2) The page won't finish loading until that's done.

But if you send the request to the ping RPC server via a standard AJAX data technique, wouldn't that completely solve the perceived wait time issue?

There is nothing wrong with CGI or FastCGI, it is my preferred SAPI of use.

Unfortunately we can't wait for them.

No, the previous e-mails did not say that. Before you confuse yourself
more, let me paste some code.

  67  function spawn_cron() {
  68      if ( array_shift( array_keys( get_option( 'cron' ) ) ) > time() )
  69          return;
  70
  71      $cron_url = get_settings( 'siteurl' ) . '/wp-cron.php';
  72      $parts = parse_url( $cron_url );
  73
  74      $argyle = @ fsockopen( $parts['host'],
$_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'], $errno, $errstr, 0.01 );
  75      if ( $argyle )
  76          fputs( $argyle,
  77                "GET {$parts['path']}?check=" . md5(DB_PASS .
'187425') . " HTTP/1.0\r\n"
  78              . "Host: {$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']}\r\n\r\n"
  79          );
  80  }

The important stuff here is lines 74-78, which open a socket with a
very short timeout to request the WP-cron file. In retrospect, the
timeout could possibly be increased just a hair, and it might help the
cron spawn more reliably under heavy loads, but anyways, the idea
behind this is the server requests the file and then the socket times
out, so that the user who is viewing the page that fired the cron
request doesn't have to wait. In the mean time, the wp-cron.php which
is requested does the heavy lifting, completely in the background.


> I don't understand this: you say the problem is that in a PHP-as-CGI setup, PHP files can't grab files off the local server and wait for the ping to go through.

Its PHP as CGI under apache. Every other environment I've tested has
worked well, including my personal favourite, PHP as FastCGI under
lighttpd.

> Fine. Do we have to do it via PHP? If we're doing it server-side, we can require that CGI users have perl or python or _something else_ installed, and spawn that instead... can't we?

No.

> After all, CGI is terrible anyway.
Don't base decisions just on this thread, the CGI/FastCGI PHP SAPI is
arguably the fastest and most secure way to run PHP there is.


> Or if you want to do it server-side but don't want users to wait, can't we use AJAX to do this sort of thing? If you use an image tag, technically

This is why we also can't use an iframe or anything else, we're
putting unsuspecting users up for a potentially huge wait.

> But if you send the request to the ping RPC server via a standard AJAX data technique, wouldn't that completely solve the perceived wait time issue?

No. First, AJAX can't request to remote servers, so we still must
bounce through the local server and have it send the RPC pings on our
behalf. Secondly, while asynchroneous, you still get the illusion that
the page is not done loading, an undesirable sideeffect.


Also, it should be clarified that this problem is not to fix pings
alone. The cron facilities can be used by plugins to do anything they
want to do, especially if it is something CPU intensive that may take
a while. I personally have a mini-plugin that uses the cron facilities
to generate static statistics of what's happened over a week's time
period, and add that to static statistics of the overall time period,
and even minimal statistics reporting like this can cause some
undesirable waits that having the cron run in the background fixes.

Re: Robert's Reply

I'm still a bit lost. Having looked at the code in question, it's a lot more clear now.. but I still don't see why exactly this works with normal SAPI but not CGI (Just for the record, PHP ISAPI on IIS is faster than CGI PHP on Apache :P)...

Would using CURL instead of fopen solve the problem?

Good god no! Are you determined to alienate most of the WordPress 
userbase? First you suggest using cron, which excludes anyone on Windows 
or without cron/permission to use it, then you suggest using Perl or 
Python?! Sheeesh.

On Windows you should be using PHP as an ISAPI, not as CGI.

Yep, those  possibilities are  real. But they're what I've come to   
believe  are acceptable risks. Even if  a false positive does get in  
there  from time to time, the chances of  that affecting a legit user  
who wants to see one of  my customers' sites is extremely low. Also,  
the firewall  can only take so many IPs, and it automatically rotates  
old IPs off the  top of the stack when it adds new ones. And I can  
always whitelist an IP if I get a complaint. The value of the  
technique hugely outweighs any downsides, IMO.

When I wrote the Argyle pinging code that would eventually be pasted
into the cron code, it worked beautifully on every machine I tested. I
mean it was a thing of perfect beauty. Then it got committed to core
and hell broke loose for a small fraction of testers. I grabbed one of
the afflicted and got access to his server for experimentation. That
was several months ago now so the details are fading from memory but I
will try to illuminate this thread with what I can recall.

The exact issue is not that PHP as CGI cannot open the socket to the
local machine. The socket opens and the targeted script begins to run.
At some point during execution, a conspiracy of factors causes the
script to abort without any errors. Output was one factor I recall
finding; an echo or a print would halt the script. That was easily
fixed. The second factor was tougher. Opening another socket (e.g. a
pingback to another blog) was okay but a subsequent attempt to open a
socket would kill the script.

Let me repeat that for clarity: as the post was saved, Argyle opened
execute-pings.php, and execute-pings would have to fsockopen once for
every ping. Only the first ping would be sent because the second
fsockopen would kill the script. If any errors were logged, I could
not find them. I was only given FTP access.

My solution was to check the SAPI and use the old iframe trick if it
was CGI. This worked well on the problem host except when an admin
page view did not immediately follow the publishing action, i.e.
bookmarklet and xmlrpc posting.

This should be tested again by someone who can reproduce the problem.
The code is now very different from what I remember writing.

 From the article: "A number of MySpace users posted comments
on  other  blogging  services  - such as  Live  Journal  and
Wordpress - about the temporary closure of the site."

It's  interesting that they don't mention TypePad, who  have
had  similar  recurring issues in the past (at  least  twice
this year, I suspect).

I  don't know about WordPress-specific tools, but there  are
many  command-line  utilities to simplify the  rendering  of
ASCII  art. Have a look at freshmeat.net as they will almost
definitely  be something there. Here, for example, is a  use
of  a script (binary) called boxes, as well as a Perl script
called paradj.

,----[ indent.sh ]
| cboard=`dcop klipper klipper getClipboardContents`
| echo $cboard > ~/in

You don't mean that all the MT code around the BBC site could possibly
interfere with their editorial decisions?

I know I modified a little bit of the sockets code, what I thought may
have been just for clarity at the time, but its been a while since I
looked at the cron code as well, so who knows? :D

I'm glad you informed the list.  

Good article.  Thank you. 

I am assuming that wp_cache_get() will return FALSE, if ENABLE_CACHE is not
defined.  So, it is safe to write the code directly using wp_cache_get
rather than checking the ENABLE_CACHE value every time.  Is that correct?

And wow - you're a proud Devo fan!  I guess since the originals were from
Akron, ground zero for me, I should not make fun.  But ever since I read
your article with your Dev2.o banner beside it, I can't get these lyrics out
of my head...

When your query's really long, you must cache it.
You must cache it!
Cache it good...

ENABLE_CACHE means that "persistent" caching is enabled. Even if the 
persistent cache is disabled, the in-memory cache that is tossed with 
each page load is still operational.  wp_cache_get() will retrieve 
values from that in-memory cache.  A typical page load does 
get_option('siteurl') many times.  If we didn't cache the siteurl value 
to memory, we would have to make dozens of round trips to the DB.

ENABLE_CACHE and DISABLE_CACHE aren't part of the API and shouldn't be 
used in plugins.  They are simply wp-config settings that control the 
default cache.

If you read the comments, clearly you should realize by now that you
need not know. The only people who need to know right now are Ryan and
Matt, so that they can get a new release out to fix the vulnerability
A.S.A.P. If details were disclosed to the public, that puts them in
the hands of malicious users as well.

Before this gets dismissed, this is not another "the funnel is too
small, give someone else commit access" e-mails.

As you all might've seen, a lot of FUD has been going around lately,
about a critical vulnerability. People are worried, some of the people
like DrDave love to post it to their blogs and upset the world.
Granted, I think this is the entirely wrong way to handle things, but
as long as things keep going like they're going, I'm sure people will
continue doing things like this.

Security e-mails appear to their reporters to be ignored. As I
understand it in the past, a lot of crap gets sent through to
security@wordpress.org, and obviously it must get rather frustrating
and tiring for Matt and Ryan to have to read through these e-mails,
possibly even leaving a legit threat in the stack of crap e-mails.
(I'm trying to think of any way to explain something other than these
mails are just ignored here, work with me). At any rate, something
isn't working. Security patches aren't being reviewed and committed
fast enough, and people like to make noise about it, a huge PR
disaster.

So, basically, I think we need to come together and figure out the
best course of action to ensure that things don't keep going astray
like this. Perhaps a person or a team of trusted people to sort
through the security e-mails, create a proper patch, and have some way
to contact Matt and Ryan more quickly and reliably than one of these
lists to get the information to them. Maybe there's another, better
course of action I haven't thought of yet? Whatever is done, I hope
that this isn't just another pointless flame-thread. Responses?

it doesn't make much sense. it would seem to me that there would have at
least been some discussion or a trac ticket of an issue that was that big of
a deal. wouldn't unchecking "anyone can register" effectively eliminate the
whole possibility or process of a user "registering" on a site anyway ? I
see that matt made a post over there, and it doesn't look like he's really
answered with any real information. 

ps. you'll note that I've copied you personally on the reply, it looks like
I'm either having some kind of problem with my comcast email or something is
up with the wp-lists today. I've sent in a couple of posts which haven't
shown up, and I've only started receiving posts from any of the lists in the
past hour or so today. have you noticed any problems ? I'm also wondering of
mcafee's anti-worm nonsense is stopping anything I'm sending to wp-
anything.

See, that's kind of the problem, we're not _allowed_ to know just how far the damage is, and the 'inside info' presented on Dr. Dave's blog doesn't make things any better.

i've been having some kind of email issue, which is preventing me from sending/receiveing to the wp-lists today for some reason. at any rate, i was pretty disturbed to read the DrDave post and responses. Personally, I'm sure that it's simply an over-reaction, or a purposefull "dig" at wp for whatever reason, and likely relates to a known, existing trac ticket. 

in the unlikely event that there is in fact an issue of that magnitude that has for whatever reason not been disclosed/discussed and/or addressed by the community, that's a serious problem. it's also not fair to dump the entire issue in matt/ryan's lap either. 

I would propose that a better solution for dealing with these kinds of security issues (both in terms of public perception/marketing, and in terms of actually addressing them) is as follows - 

1) eliminate the security@wp email solution, and establish a wp-security mailing list. 
2) create a web based form for reporting of any security issues, PROMOTE the heck out of the link to the form everywhere. set the form up so that it sends the report directly (transparent to the users/reporter) to the wp-security list. 
3) subscribers to the security list would then as a community be able to assess or filter what's important from what's not, plus respond to each reporter of an issue, even if it's just a canned response like -- that's not really an issue, see wp codex/forums link ... ---
once the report is "filtered" the security list subscribers would then forward important/"real" issues to both/either matt/ryan and the trac folks to take a look at and address. 

this type of system would completely eliminate the kind of BS in the DrDave post, since any time a post like that pops up, the wp community would be able to respond in a meaningful way with either relevant information from the wp-security list/trac tickets or, completely shoot down the BS posts, based on a tangible and trackable record of how each issue has been addressed. there would then be no more room for anyone to say "we've been reporting these BIG security holes and no one is doing anything about them". 

i'd like to re-emphasize -- DrDave's post is counter productive. if it has merit, why don't we already know about it ? if it's BS, why don't we have a mechanism for pointing the public to the truth.

Neither does asking about it on mailing lists and forums or reposting
with links on your own blogs, but they seem to be the popular things
to do these days.

Some plugins don't check caps as they should.  Note to plugin authors: 
WP doesn't check capabilities for you.  Entry points to your plugin need 
to be guarded by a cap check.

The issue with this is making the security vulnerabilities public via
a mailing list where anyone could subscribe allows malicious users to
see the same information, POCs, etc., that the good people see. Full
disclosure may work for other projects, but in WP's case where the
commits and releases are decided by two busy people and a release
might not come for days, full disclosure isn't an option, we simply
can't leave hundreds of thousands of users sitting at risk.

> this type of system would completely eliminate the kind of BS in the DrDave post, since any time a post like that pops up, the wp community would be able to respond in a meaningful way with either relevant information from the wp-security list/trac tickets or, completely shoot down the BS posts, based on a tangible and trackable record of how each issue has been addressed. there would then be no more room for anyone to say "we've been reporting these BIG security holes and no one is doing anything about them".

Simply having better feedback from the security e-mail would also
elimiate this, and so I don't think a full disclosure type list is the
way to go. A private, invitation only mailing list for proven members
of the community may be the way, however.

> i'd like to re-emphasize -- DrDave's post is counter productive. if it has merit, why don't we already know about it ?

<em>We</em> don't do anything about it because we know nothing about
it. Not that this is a bad thing, the general public needs not to
know. The issue is that the developers aren't doing anything apparent
or vocal enough about it.

> if it's BS, why don't we have a mechanism for pointing the public to the truth.

Good question, as there has been false security advisories creating
FUD in the past. (ala
http://www.neosecurityteam.net/index.php?action=advisories&id=17 ),
where we went without an official response for days. Why? Who knows.

I agree with the latter, but I'm not asking for full disclosure here in the mailing list, I just want 
1) Confirmation that it's not BS
2) _Official_ threat level, just how serious is it?
3) Possible fix dates
4) Most importantly: how did Dr. Dave find out, who knows the dirty details and shouldn't?

I'm just as curious as CG here.. Being that, when it comes to ppls blog's.. 
that is their "life". And if someone is out there trying to "mess" with 
their "blog/life".. everyone should be in the know, and should be 
told/warned/led to the reassurance of things being fixed, and the "true" 
seriousness or not, of the issue at hand..

Just my 2cents.. of course lol.

If plugins don't check caps, it can be very serious.

Thanks for being here Ryan, 

I don't understand. Dr. Dave's post _doesn't_ allude to plugins, it says it's a WP threat in general. So it's not? Like, if I have no plugins, I'm safe? The WP-Core isn't affected? 

Then, pardon my asking, what's the veil of secrecy for if it's a plugin vulnerability?

Thanks Ryan!

the invitation only list is probably the best solution, this way there's
more than two folks able to filter/respond/act, I'd agree that making
"public" information of a serious problem would only put users at risk, but
having a larger number of trusted folks in the loop is a must in order to
help deal with these type issues more efficiently and quickly.

>>>>can't do anything without Matt's blessing.

That's a problem for a couple of reasons. First, wp has become a pretty
large scale project, with an enormous user base, it simply isn't practical
for one or two individuals to be expected to handle or be responsible for
all of the things that need to be done at this stage. Second, at this point,
it's a community project, moving forward, more responsibility is going to
need to be handed off to the community. Right now, when things like this pop
up, matt's the one wearing the bull's-eye as far as the public is concerned.
It shouldn't be that way. The community needs to develop mechanisms for self
governance and community responsibility, and thus dealing with issues like
this. Whether issues like this one are genuine or not is almost irrelevant,
what's almost more important is that folks like DrDave and those type posts
are really taking a jab at matt personally, and looking for him to make a
response, or looking to blame him personally for issues like this, which
isn't fair to matt or to the community.

Look at something like apache, when someone throws stones in their
direction, the community puts a stake in the ground and makes a definitive
statement which completely removes personalities and egos from the picture.
When the "community" can react effectively to things like DrDave's post in
that manner, those types of posts will die out pretty quickly, and when they
do pop up they won't mean much.

issues to both/either matt/ryan and the trac folks to take a look at and

The issue with this is making the security vulnerabilities public via a
mailing list where anyone could subscribe allows malicious users to see the
same information, POCs, etc., that the good people see. Full disclosure may
work for other projects, but in WP's case where the commits and releases are
decided by two busy people and a release might not come for days, full
disclosure isn't an option, we simply can't leave hundreds of thousands of
users sitting at risk.

DrDave post, since any time a post like that pops up, the wp community would
be able to respond in a meaningful way with either relevant information from
the wp-security list/trac tickets or, completely shoot down the BS posts,
based on a tangible and trackable record of how each issue has been
addressed. there would then be no more room for anyone to say "we've been
reporting these BIG security holes and no one is doing anything about them".

Simply having better feedback from the security e-mail would also elimiate
this, and so I don't think a full disclosure type list is the way to go. A
private, invitation only mailing list for proven members of the community
may be the way, however.

<em>We</em> don't do anything about it because we know nothing about it. Not
that this is a bad thing, the general public needs not to know. The issue is
that the developers aren't doing anything apparent or vocal enough about it.

> if it's BS, why don't we have a mechanism for pointing the public to the
truth.

Good question, as there has been false security advisories creating FUD in
the past. (ala
http://www.neosecurityteam.net/index.php?action=advisories&id=17 ), where we
went without an official response for days. Why? Who knows.

The plugins still need to be fixed, so a little secrecy is in order even 
though this thread has probably given up the game already.

Regardless of this bug, 2.0.4 is a security release.  Let's test the 
beta and get it out there.

And it just so happens, conversations on IRC illustrated just the
thing that this thread was started as a concern to address. [Yes, this
has been trimmed, to cut out noise, nothing incredibly important was
cut out]

(04:05:41) ? zedrdave reads the number of people trackbacking to
announce they are closing guest registration and doesn't have a single
regret.
(04:05:42) (Libertus) zedrdave: Is the Wp problem you have publicised
anything to do with plugins?
(04:05:49) (zedrdave) Libertus: a bit.
(04:06:03) (Libertus) zedrdave: Any particular plugin?
(04:06:17) (zedrdave) Libertus: nope. well, don't really feel like
discussing it. sorry.
(04:06:46) (Libertus) zedrdave: Fine.
(04:06:50) (zedrdave) Libertus: 'has nothing to do with you or anybody
here, but quite obviously you realize if I start blathering about it,
*then* I would be seriously affecting WP users.
(04:07:05) (Libertus) zedrdave: WP users are already seriously
affected, and you're not a WP dev
(04:07:19) (zedrdave) Libertus: Just a concerned user, just a concerned user :)
(04:07:24) (Libertus) 6 weeks so far without a fix
(04:07:54) (zedrdave) Libertus: and believe me, they'd be much more
affected if the exploit was simply spelt out directly.
(04:08:14) (Libertus) zedrdave: Which I'm going to do today, I think,
on my blog.
(04:08:31) (Libertus) I have the exploit file sitting on my desktop

So, now we've got people of our own community who want to give out
details on the exploit. Why? Let's see...

(04:09:34) (masquerade) oh for the love of... as if generating
unnecessary FUD prior to a bugfix/security release was bad enough, now
we've got people who want to publish how to exploit it
(04:10:18) (Libertus) masquerade: I've been wanting to publish ever
since I found the bug. It's the best way to get lazy devs to fix their
software.

We're back to the same old thing, the devs didn't react fast enough?
Is this a reason to hand out the keys to hundreds of thousands of WP
blogs? Not quite, imho, but you know, maybe I'm just nuts.

(04:10:56) (masquerade) Libertus, the best way to get them to fix a
bug might be, the best way to get them to fix a security vulnerability
is not to hand the keys to hundreds of thousands of WordPress installs
over to malicious users
(04:12:28) (masquerade) the ideal thing to do is change the way the
development process works, i.e. bring up threads on the hackers list,
eventually we'll get change
(04:12:43) (Libertus) I'll wait to see if the WP devs put out an
interim warning, asking blog users to disable registration until they
upgrade to 2.0.4
(04:13:27) (masquerade) 2.0.4 hit beta last night, help them ensure
anything necessary is fixed and let the release go out without putting
clueless users at risk
(04:14:39) (Libertus) masquerade: Clueless users are one think. Users
deliberately kept clueless is another.
(04:15:48) (Libertus) I'll be looking at 2.0.4 beta. I was part of the
bughunt after all.


Still, as long as there's a delay without feedback, people won't be
able to think sensibly about holding on to what they have. With the
proper feedback, we should be able to prevent these posts from
surfacing from most people, at least before the fix is released, but
more importantly, we need to ensure that someone who finds or is
reminded of the details of an exploit through one of these FUD popup
posts don't find the inclination to practice Full Disclosure to get
WordPress fixed.

Its likely to affect multiple plugins, and a majority of WordPress
installs, and really we shouldn't give the details out to the
malicious users.

I now end up wondering whether I should fix my own plugins or not...

I check user levels, not caps. And I rely on WP to check this for me, via
the admin interface's built-in protections. This is what most plugin authors
do, as far as I can tell. If doing this is wrong, we've got a huge number of
plugins in need of fixing. Or a huge WordPress workflow error.

Anyway... without any information, how should I or any other plugin author
guess if anything needs to be fixed, and what needs to be fixed?

Thank you Ryan for addressing our concerns :)

It's a shame it had to come to Dr. Dave "scheming" to post it on his blog, I hope it doesn't reach this stage here in the future, WordPress is such a great project.

Dr. Dave had the added benefit of releasing it as a news bulletin - everyone that used Spam Karma 2 saw a big red blob that said danger and linked to his sight. FUD.

The first I heard of this particular problem was a couple days ago, and 
I'm still not sure what the core API problem he is referring to is. 
Hopefully it's the issue I found, but I'm not sure.

To clarify, there was a small WP problem with 
user_can_access_admin_page().  Pages registered in add_submenu() weren't 
always getting the registered cap checked.  However, most of the plugin 
problems I've seen have related to unprotected action handlers, not menu 
pages.  Regardless, 2.0.4 beta fixes user_can_access_admin_page().

Plugins need to be sure to put current_user_can() checks wherever access 
control is needed.  I think some authors were assuming that WP checks 
for them.  It does not. WP doesn't know what user level/capability the 
various parts of a plugin require.  An audit of plugins shows that some 
plugins have been making this assumption for a long, long time.

Saying so here won't make much of a dent in changing that. I've never
heard of current_user_can(), either, along with, apparently, a lot of
other plugin devs. This would lead me to believe there is a failure in
documentation which should probably also be addressed along with this
security vulnerability, if this is so important.

User level checks are fine.  WP checks the cap/level you pass when you 
register a menu/submenu and uses that to deny access to the plugin, but 
that is not sufficient for plugins that use multiple files and do more 
"advanced things". Some plugins need to add more fine-grained cap 
checking.  Most plugins are fine though.

I like to protect all non-idempotent operations with cap checks, even 
when the umbrella check should protect them.  I'd suggest creating a 
Subscriber level user on a test blog and then directly enter the URLs 
that load your plugin.  Make sure the caps are enforced for all entry 
points to your plugin.

9 emails later... you've wasted a lot of Ryan's time by starting this
thread while he could have actually been productive at fixing the issue.

And we wonder why things don't/can't get done around here.

Oh please, give me a break. If Ryan wants to complain, no one is stopping him. If he didn't want to reply, he didn't have to.

And did you even _read_ the 9 emails? It's nothing Ryan or Matt _can_ fix, it's up to the plugin devs themselves.

Thanks for saying this Joey - I'm glad I'm not the only one. I've  
done my best with what's in the codex and by working through other  
peoples plugin code but if the ones I looked at didn't do things  
right then I just inherited the same old problems. WordPress is a  
fantastic platform to work with but by encouraging a third party  
plugin architecture there is a dire need for specific documentation  
that is lacking. Sadly, the only people who can really compile that  
documentation are the people who designed the architecture in the  
first place. Without that, plugins will continue to cause certain  
users problems and lay themselves open to vulnerabilities that we  
didn't even know were possible. I know you guys work hard and you  
have my admiration and respect but to just throw out the comment that  
authors need to do this or that doesn't help most of us one little bit.

If I could write it up I would!

If you're relying on the cap/level check provided when you register a 
menu/submenu, that will cover most plugins.  There is indeed a bug in 
2.0.3 that breaks this check in some cases.  2.0.4 beta fixes this.  If 
you don't register a menu and don't do a level or cap check, your plugin 
is vulnerable.

Personally, I never really meant the menu cap check to be relied upon 
quite so heavily.  It was offered as a convenience thing for simple 
plugins. I use current_user_can() in my plugins.

current_user_can() is the heart of the capability system.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities

Looks like we need to do a better job of documenting with regard to 
plugin development.

Actually, I had it fixed before the thread was started.  :-) At least I 
think it's fixed.  I was getting a bit confused about which bug we were 
talking about and the exact nature of the bug.  I've now talked to Dave, 
and I think I got it.  I'm to blame in part for confusing the issue.

To recap, there is a bug in core WP involved that I believe I've fixed 
for 2.0.4.  This is the core API bug Dave is talking about on his blog. 
  I was in error before to say that this is a problem to be fixed solely 
by the plugins.  There are some plugins that need help beyond the fix to 
the core, but the core fix should cover most plugins.  Sorry for the 
confusion.

And with that, I really need to get some sleep.  Later all.

  First things first: upgrade. 2.0.3 is the latest stable, with many
  bugfixes and security fixes. 2.0.4 is almost stable and has even more
  bug and security fixes. After upgrading to one of those, see if your
  problem persists. Also, this is better suited for the support forums.

Following the flood of mail today I have a little something to suggest
that I think could help. The IRC meetup immedietly after the last
bug-hunt included discussion about making bug-hunts ( or bug-massacres
) a regularly scheduled event. I think that's a great idea, but
perhaps the next group effort should be directed at the codex.

Yes? No? "be quiet n00b!"?

Sounds like a good idea to me. The Codex is in need of some sprucing
up and some additions.

+1, but you're still a n00b.

What should plugin authors be using as the capability to put into the
current_user_can() test?

Should there be a recommended default capability? ('activate_plugins'?)
Should plugin authors create an option where the user can select which
capability determines access to its administrative functions? Should
plugin authors be looking to create new capabilities in the system?

And are there examples of code for plugins to perform the capability check
with backwards compatibility to the user_level system as well? How soon
can plugin authors be educated on how to 'fix' their contributions?

Geoff

Hi Erwin,

It's probably related to this ticket:

  http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2460

The "=" signs are just quoted-printable encoding; it isn't decoded
when it should be. You might be able to fix it with a plugin, but I'm
not sure if it'll work (and if not, you'll have to wait for a fix in
the core):

    <?php
    /*
    Plugin Name: Quoted Printable Decode
    Plugin URI: http://wordpress.org/
    Description: Bandaid
    Author:
    Version: 1.0
    Author URI:
    */

    add_filter('phone_content', 'quoted_printable_decode');
    ?>

As I mentioned in a previous post to this and the docs list yesterday which
I'm not sure made it through due to some weird email problems, I've been
doing some poking around in the codex and have noticed a number of really
outdated items -- example - 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_Pages

this section currently states: "Note: Your .htaccess file must be writeable
for Page Permalinks to work, otherwise you must update your .htaccess file
every time you create a Page." 

that is currently inaccurate, correct ? in wp 2.x.x permalinks for pages
should work "automatically" in the same manner as they are configured for
posts correct ? I put a comment in the section which isn't visible so that I
or the next person who takes a look at editing that section is aware, but if
I'm correct I'll just go back and remove that line. 

like I said, there's tons of stuff like that floating around in the codex
right now, that's going to be a huge task to really get cleaned up. I'm
definitely willing to do what I can to help get that in ship shape, but I
think we really should develop a plan of attack. I've sent off a couple of
emails to the wp-docs list in the past couple of weeks, and it doesn't seem
to me that anyone on that list is really paying any attention.

what's the projected date for 2.0.4 ? 
is there an easy way to provide users an 'interim' patch or upgrade to plug

And just to add that if you combine capped/levelled admin menus with 
nonce checks, you largely avoid any methods of getting your form actions 
to execute for non-privileged users, even if they're in files separate 
to the admin menus.

I think a better idea would to continue to have bug-hunts for code, and 
create a new docu-orgy of some kind---separate to the bug hunt---for 
updating the codex.

Hi guys,

I was wondering if anyone knew the correct way of getting a single 
WordPress install to work over two domains?

I currently have mem-gaming.co.uk/v2/ and midnightevil.co.uk/v2/ running 
off the same install.

But of course in the theme i use get_bloginfo quite a bit, so how can i 
get around the fact that WordPress thinks its only installed on 
mem-gaming.co.uk domain?

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2 URLs 1 WordPress install
Importance: Low


Hi guys,

I was wondering if anyone knew the correct way of getting a single 
WordPress install to work over two domains?

I currently have mem-gaming.co.uk/v2/ and midnightevil.co.uk/v2/ running 
off the same install.

But of course in the theme i use get_bloginfo quite a bit, so how can i 
get around the fact that WordPress thinks its only installed on 
mem-gaming.co.uk domain?

Cheers
Mark

How about the latest SVN beta? Ryan said that he thinks all the fixes
are done for 2.0.4 beta which he has requested people to hammer away
at.

Look into Apache Aliasing or setup both domains separately and do a 301
Redirect on the entire domain2 to domain1.

I couldn't agree more. It took me some time before I really found out about
the current_user_can() and once I found it life was much easier. The role
capabilities plugin makes using this feature extra nice. I would almost like
to see some sort of role manager placed into the WP core and even more roles
added (like a can_moderate_comments). 

The user roles and capabilities should be used in all plugins requiring
access checks, but I got a feeling many people either a) don't know about it
or b) shy away because you need a plugin to really set user capabilities.

No, not at all. You can use the 2.0.4 SVN, it's safe and patched as of 10 minutes ago :)

The vulnerabilities left involve plugins that have admin-pages- do you use them?

That's certainly not the opinion of most other OSS projects.

Sounds great, one of the reasons I use WordPress for most of my  
clients' sites (even non-blog sites) is because of the great  
documentation, alowing me to find out how to do anything, so keeping  
the codex up-to-date is important.

No. _If_ you use the 2.0.4 beta _and_ double-check the plugins _then_ you are alright.

Hi,
How are you doing this? with one database or two? I've figured out a  
way to use 1 install for 2 (or more) different domains (on the same  
server) with separate databases, but the only thing I ddidn't work  
out is the admin section, it doesn't know which database to work on.
Just curious about how all this works.

Its one site, with one DB, it does work as it stands but as i use 
get_bloginfo() to get the URL links and forms all go to mEm-Gaming.co.uk 
- i could just replace that in the theme and just grab the domain.

But i was just wondering if there was away to make WP use two domains :S

This might be slightly orthogonal to the current discussion, but I think
the overall flow of the conversation points to a huge, HUGE feature that
WordPress and WP users alike would benefit greatly from: a unified,
OFFICIAL plugin update mechanism.

Plugins have increasingly become one of the huge reasons for the
widespread use of WP - they add manifold functionality for everything
from wikifying a blog to making image galleries to podcasting to turning
WP into a full-featured CMS.  Plugins also, carelessly-written, open WP
up to many security holes.  Like it or not, these security issues end up
being blamed on the WP core.

There needs to be a Dashboard widget that alerts blog owners to the fact
that DrDave has updated SK2, that Mark J.'s Subscribe To plugin has
patched a security hole, or that Skippy's Gravatars plugin now lets you
select between curl() and fopen().

The more I think about it, the better of an idea this seems to me. 
Plugin informational payloads should include a field for revision number
(with a WP core-enforced numbering scheme so we avoid idiocy like the
Epoch issues that plagued the early goings of Fedora Core), a brief
description of the changes and a change/issues fixed flag - does the
patch address security issues, is it a simple bugfix, or is it a feature
enhancement release?  Slap an official color code scheme on that final
field (red for security, yellow for bugs, green for features, you get
the picture) and away you go.

Then, when these sorts of issues come up and are raised to the plugin
authors themselves, the burden lies upon them to publish a new rev and
update the plugin info repo with the appropriate details.

I know this issue has been discussed before, at-length, but I think it's
finally time to start addressing it in an official capacity.

YMMV, IANAWPD, etc.

Try putting some sort of logic into wp-config.php that chooses which db

    define(DB_NAME, "site1_db");
} elseif ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] == "site2.mydomain.com") {
    define(DB_NAME, "site2_db");
}

Kludgy, but effective.  Should work for admin as well as frontend.  
You'll also need access to your server setup, so you can define the same 
docroot for all subdomains.

It boils down to one thing: this requires _external_ server.
Look at Akismet or Pingomatic. The two external services WP uses. So slow!! 

Now imagine the kind of stress a universal plugin server would cause. Just imagine.

Does anyone know why the wp_mail() function would not work correctly on 
an IIS server yet the exact same code works as intended on a *nix 
server?  (As a side note, the normal php mail() is not working either.)

To add to the confusion, WP's notification of comments *does* work.

Are there possibly mail header issues with IIS?  If you have any 
experience with this, please e-mail me or point me in the direction of 
solutions.

Thanks for any ideas,

Brian

Sure, in this case, it may have helped (and may still help), but I
think this recommendation is too specific to this particular event.
When this thread was written, I still didn't know the details of this
vulnerability, and now its obvious that knowing the details are
changing the way people look at the situation, but imagine for a
minute that this vulnerability was a 100% core issue, and we had
people from our own community publishing articles on how to exploit it
so that "lazy developers will fix their software". Obviously,
something's wrong with that picture.

I'm not advocating for a shared hosting environment - a dedicated
server/set of servers properly load-balanced would obviously be the
right route to pursue.

However, I'm not advocating checking each and every plugin every time an
admin page loads - plug the whole thing into the cron infrastructure and
have it run once daily or so, user-selectable of course, nor am I
advocating keeping the plugins themselves on official servers.  The info
on the centralized servers would be mere package headers and a pointer
to the right place to download updates.  (This, like the rest of the
scheme, would be highly dependent on plugin authors to Do The Right
Thing, of course, and publish their files in easily-accessible
locations, keep meta info up to date, etc.).

If php's mail() function _isn't_ working, why would you expect wp_mail() to work? 
Unless I'm missing something, you've just ID'd the problem....

It's the same kind of thinking that drove the Month of Browser Bugs:
http://browserfun.blogspot.com/

That royally pissed off Microsoft, yet Firefox and Opera reacted quickly
and fixed issues raised by Metasploit.  Let's be Firefox, not Microsoft
in our approach to these things.  Perhaps we should take a look at their
methodologies for addressing security issues...

Now you're talking. If we set aside the expenses of new dedicated servers, it's not a hard feat to accomplish.
Basically: take Dr. Dave's wp-plugins.net and add an XML RPC server to it. You're done.

I'm willing to help with the code, but, again, $$$$$ comes first.

It notifies of new comments and such, which makes me wonder what is 
going on.

Now that's more of the response I was hoping to see.

Firefox itself has both a security mailing list and their bugzilla
available for reporting and discussiong security issues. Both are open
to the public. Personally, I like the idea of a mailing list, but one
that is closed to invitation only (and maybe with archives that are
updated after each release for the public to see the discussion that
took place).

I know the first argument is going to be "Firefox's security lists are
open to the public, why shouldn't ours be?" First and foremost, it
would be very difficult to target a single person running Firefox to
infect them in any way. Second, its not just the security of our users
we're putting at risk, we're putting shared hosting companies at risk
as well. Servers are more popular targets for a certain range of
malicious black hats because they have the bandwidth that infecting
home machines through a browser does not. And last but not least,
Firefox can update itself when a new security fix is available, so to
them, who cares if the whole world sees as long as its resolved within
a short enough time?

The ability to auto-update is a very recent addition to Firefox and
Thunderbird - I could be wrong, but I don't think Seamonkey even has
parity in this respect yet.  You're right, though, in that a blogging
platform is inherently a different proposition than a web browser and
the effects of auto-updating are too perilous to give any weight to such.

Is there a way to "stealth" tickets in Trac?  Perhaps anything tagged as
"security" could be hidden from anyone but Trac admins and the submitter
until the issue was marked as "closed", in which case the ticket could
be opened to the world.  'Twould use the existing infrastructure in a
new way to handle an old, persistent problem...

Indeed, in this case we had the person reporting moaning on irc that  
he wan't getting a response and there was nothing anyone there could do.
The result of this end up being zedrdave's post which just created  
more uncertainty about the issue.

The only thing a responsible user can do is try and make sure that  
ryan/matt know about the issue by mentioning it on irc / via direct  
email even though they don't actually know what it is or anything  
about it necessarilly and this just creates extra work for ryan/matt  
who are probably in the process of evaluating and fixing the issue.

I think this would be a beneficial process.

I have personally in the past attempted to take this approach and  
analyse and work on a patch for any security issues which are made  
public (such as the recent issue with the on disk cache fixed in v2.0.3)

You should look into how Debian manages this. In summary, multiple  
blogs are hosted off the same server and same wp-install, by  
rewriting wp-config.php as

<?php
/** WordPress's Debianised default master config file
Please do NOT edit and read about how the configuration works in the  
README.Debian
**/

require_once('/etc/wordpress/config-'.strtolower($_SERVER 
['HTTP_HOST']).'.php');

define('ABSPATH', '/usr/share/wordpress/');

require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');


?>


where config-host.php contains database information for each  
individual blog.

I have done this with ruckerz.oldbrownshoe.org,  
sara.oldbrownshoe.org, etc.

I've further added plugins to customize the theme directories (so  
each blog can manage their own themes), cache, uploads.  
Unfortunately, so many plugin authors hard code wp-content/plugins  
that each blog cannot have their own plugins .

My life would be much easier if I could filter the location of wp- 
content.

The obvious benefit (at least from an administrator's point of view)  
is that I can upgrade all my WP installations via apt-get.


If you're interested in this setup, e-mail me privately.

I agree there has to be a limited number of people notified of security
issues as they are discovered and evaluated.  It seems that, as of 2.0.3,
the largest hole is fixed. But, that doesn't mean that large hole won't be
found again.  When something like that occurs, I'm sorry, but some attempt
to restrict its spread is warranted.

Conversely, I don't know how such a team could do quick security releases -
or even an SVN check-ins, in a way that the majority of sites will be
willing to apply these frequent updates.  

Maybe peter's update notification thing will help some, but it still means
work for people.  Releasing a critical fix that only a few sites apply is
practically the same as publicly discussing the original security hole.  And
most bloggers are not into blogging for the technical site of it.  Ever more
often they are people who don't enjoy spending hours playing with the
technical stuff.  They just want their sites to work.

There seems to be no easy fix for this that isn't just some pie in the sky
solution.... If the WordPress install had an md5 for each file and an
automatic update system that could apply fixes if the md5 matched the
version requirement for the fix, then security fixes could be released
quickly and applied to the majority of the sites at no pain for the users.
Strategic code changes and targeted fixes released long before the next
minor release that includes new features.  Pie in the sky...

A similar, but more targeted idea might be to develop a plugin certification
process and a server that could respond whether a particular version of the
plugin has been certified or not.  

There would need to be a group of people that could look at plugins
submitted for approval.  They'd be experienced enough to do a once over to
verify that the current approved standard practices are applied.  This could
be done fairly easily with a set number of checks - Does the check the user
level before adding its pages?  Can any pages be accessed directly without
verifying user capabilities?  If fields are submitted, are the contents
filtered/protected?

If you wanted an automatic safety report on the plugin page or dashboard or
wherever, you could require each certified plugin have a GUID in its header.
A the plugin checking feature would send requests to the server with each
plugin's GUID and version.  The certification server, could respond with a
single character response: 
C = Certified/Current; 
O=Old/Out of Date; 
R=Red Flagged/Revoked Certification; 
I=Invalid/Incomplete Submission. 
That would be a relatively small server load.

The biggest thing, other than the volunteer recruitment, would be coming up
with the list of what certification means.  And that, pretty much, would
match a FAQ that should already exist anyway.

I don't disagree, however, not everyone has a dashboard, and most
people wouldn't know what to do with some of the updates or what they
mean. Example, I have not a friggin clue about curl() and fopen() and
whether or not it would be worth updating. This puts the onus back on
the plugin developers to properly document and inform their userbase,
which is often not something that happens. How many plugins are
created for a specific user (author, mostly) and then just released to
the wild with little or no support? Lots of them, I'm sure.

I don't have an answer on how to manage plugins, but I agree that this
is a necessary discussion.

Craig:
Those authors just releasing into the wild most likely won't be bothered
to sign their plugin up at the official site and keep it updated
whenever a new version is released.

I'm also envisioning a "digg"-esque sort of front end, where actual
users could mod plugins up or down  and once a plugin was lowered past a
certain threshold, an email would be fired off to the plugin author
saying "15 people anti-dugg your plugin's entry for being out-of-date.
Time to update your meta info on pluginrepo.wordpress.org!"  Let network
effects take care of lazy, shiftless layabouts.

Agreed, but there are authors who ARE on the official site and don't
keep the plugin up to date.

No, I think he wants _one_ blog, on several domains.


The very best way to do this is to employ mod_redirect with_out_ mod_rewrite. Point one domain to grab info off the other.

I tried to say this earlier Francis, but my SMTP server was down:
This is an elegant solution.  Well done.

If that's the case, could you do .htaccess mirroring with the [p]
option?

Put something like this in the .htaccess in the root for one domain:
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*) http://www.theotherdomain.com/$1 [P]
</IfModule>

I don't know if that would work with WordPress or not.  I haven't tried
it...

Yes your right, its ONE site but with two domains - it already works in 
a sense

www.mem-gaming.co.uk/v2/
www.midnightevil.co.uk/v2/

both go to the same site and pull the WordPress stuff, i was just in 
need of sorting out the URL links. i think i will just remove the use of 
bloginfo() for grabbing the URL out of the DB and instead just grab the 
serveruri directly from the domain.

Still some good info given here for another project i have on the cards!

Thanks
Mark

Firefox has automatic plugin updates (and version checks), and it does
not require a centralized server.  Each plugin provides the information
necessary on where to check for updates.

If WordPress had such an interface defined, I'd certainly support it
for my plugins.

You know... the dashboard would be damn near perfect for this.
If every plugin had an RSS feed for release announcements, and the plugin;
(1) Hooked into the feed polling locations for the dashboard and;
(2) Retrieved it from the owner's website (or wherever the RSS feed is
hosted, as indicated by the plugin);
That would be the perfect centralized announcement location.

A lot of us have always said/thought the dashboard should be a LOT
more customizable / flexible...

IAWTP. The closest there is to a standard right now is the plugin
metadata used by Matt Read's installer plugin and the Red Alt plugin
versioning service:

    Update Server: http://redalt.com/
    Min WP Version: 2.0
    Max WP Version: 2.0.1

No spec has been published for the server side. It uses XML-RPC,
though, and I'd personally prefer something like the plain-text
install manifests in Mozilla extensions. A plugin would have an
"Update URL" key in the metadata, leading to a plain-text file with
some data like this:

    Version: 1.0
    Min WP Version: 2.0
    Max WP Version: 2.1
    Update Description: See http://example.com/blog/2006/plugin-release
    Update Priority: normal
    Update File: http://example.com/files/plugin-1.0.zip

Since it's the same format used for plugin metadata, single file
plugins could put the URL of the plugin itself (hosted as
un-highlighted .phps or .php.txt, say) as the Update URL value.

But, whatever. This discussion went nowhere last time it came up, so I
don't see the point talking about it further unless a yay or nay comes
down from on high. Sad but true.

Here's an idea:
Why not leverage WordPress?  Create categories that roughly correspond
to high level functions (multimedia, podcasting, etc.), then
subcategories per-plugin, and then have a plugin on the blog level that
checks feeds - for instance, have a http://pluginupdatr.wordpress.com
with a /feed/podcasting/ and a /feed/podcasting/podpress/subfeed.
Plugin authors could become "contributors" and could add/update metadata
to their plugins' categories.  This would have a secondary net benefit
of allowing for an XML-enabled changelog, of sorts; one could simply hit
the feed to see the last 10 or so revs, their release dates, etc.

Actually, I'm liking this idea even more, the more I think about it,
including the fact that it could be a wordpress.com blog that served as
the infrastructure behind the beast.

Thoughts?

A better and more reliable thing to do might be using a filter on
bloginfo or the options to modify the domainname instead of removing
them from the picture altogether.

That's just what I was about to suggest -- hook into the 'bloginfo' 
filter, check against $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], and return different info 
as needed. Something like

   function twoblogs($text) {
     $hostmap = array( 'host1.example.com' => 'host2.example.com',
       'Host One Blog' => 'Blog on Host Two');

     if ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] == 'host2.example.com') {
       $newtext = $hostmap['$text'];
       if (empty($newtext)) {
         $newtext = $text;
       }
     }

     return $newtext;
    }

   add_filter('bloginfo', 'twoblogs');

In the $hostmap array, just put in mappings for whatever bloginfo 
strings should be different between the two hosts.

Make sense?

Actually it went to the "no one is willing to work on this right now" 
bin, it's obviously a good idea we want to do someday. This isn't a bad 
thing, good ideas tend to continually resurface, it's darwinian.

Anyone can and has created cool services or enhancements that get 
official blessing later, like the new themes site or plugins that we've 
included over the years. Usually the constraining factor is personal 
commitment behind the idea, not resources or infrastructure or holy water.

My suggestion was that in this case the community has not come to a
consensus. There is no lack of folk willing to work on it. There are
several competing ideas about implementation (XML-RPC, plain text,
RSS, distributed updates, central servers...), to say nothing of
possible functionality.

I don't see this as something like the themes site, because it's
virtually useless without broad support. That broad support isn't
going to happen without community consensus or an official blessing
(i.e. dictatorial fiat). The consensus isn't there, so that leaves a
decision by the project leadership. Writing code at this point would
be a waste of time.

I'm not saying that we need a spec brought down from Mount Automattic
on stone tablets --

THOU SHALT interpret the terms "SHALT" and "SHALT NOT" as described in
RFC Exodus 20 [RFCE20]...

-- but if you provide a little direction then maybe the discussion
will go somewhere useful. "Distributed updates via RSS2": okay, if
that means a new namespace then we can direct our energy into writing
a spec for it, writing tools to produce and consume it, etc. "Updates
via carrier pigeon": I can start building that on-pigeon jet engine.

If not, we'll just keep talking and talking and talking and nothing
will ever happen, *again*.

OK, about this 'going nowhere'

If I write a plugin that will open a plugin file, grab something called
'update uri' from the meta data, access that URI, and see if the versions
match, will you include it in the core?

I'd do it, it's not too hard. But it is 100% useless unless the meta data is
made an official part of WP, and it is used by *all* plugin authors, else
it's just another broken standard.

Is that fair?

It's already been done.  The three very simple plugin headers defined 
here look good to me.

And yes, we would include it in the core.  I'd like to get something 
into 2.2.

It uses PVS :(

If we want as many people to use it as possible, I think it should be a
proprietary format, some sort of plaintext or wizard-based implementation.

By plaintext I mean if you have domain.com/plugins/myplugin.php there should
be a file right then and there called /plugins/myplugin.php.ver which simply
has the product version and a direct link to it.

Wizard-based implementations might be a nifty script in the plugin
management center that generates or updates the RSS file for you and
includes the latest version of the plugin the same way podcasts include the
audio files, a brief summary/changelog, and the title as the version number.

I like the second idea more, both of these are 100% cross-platform
compatible, and the first is easier, but the second is much more powerful,
allowing for direct integration to quite a few things.

So, I'm guessing this means that a plugin without this version file would be
an invalid plugin. This would probably require the plugin author to have a
txt file on his or her site that just has a number, if the number is not
equal to the number of the plugin, then you just have to notify the user
that 1 or more of his plugins are out of date.

No to the first part, yes to the second part. A plugin without this 
metadata would for all intents and purposes act exactly the same as 
plugins currently do.

 I'd say that the most important issue isn't whether or how to implement
this type of system. But rather, a really concise explanation of plugin
architecture for "dummies", (aka the general user base, as opposed to those
with an inclination for development and adventure on their own) which is
available both in the codex plugins area AND the plugins download/extend
area of the site - something like - "before using plugins, Read Me First" - 
then, an explanation like :

TO users - if you're considering installing a plugin, please be aware that
there are two general ways which plugins function, {...} for the types of
plugins which are "benign" in nature and will have no potential security
impact, OR {....} these types of plugins have the potential to interact with
the backend functionality of WP, and thus depending on the particular plugin
authors implementation may expose this functionality to unwanted users, so
please be sure and check with the plugin author/documentation to be sure
that the plugin you'd like to use has been written in such a way to prevent
this unwanted behavior. Otherwise, use at your own risk. The WP team is
working on implementing a notification/update system for plugins which will
eventually notify you about updates/patches and enhancements to plugins you
have installed via the dashboard. 

TO Plugin Authors - As you may be aware, if your plugin presents admin panel
access to the user, you must exercise caution in your implementation. The
following guidelines for these types of plugins outlines a proper and secure
implementation {.......proper example and instructions on how to implement
current_user_can()...} Please don't forget to document your plugin as
completely as possible before releasing it to the public. In addition,
please take some time to go back and check your previously released plugins
to ensure a secure implementation. 


To digress for a moment, I'm pretty heavily involved with another OSS
project - xoops --, if you're not familiar with xoops go ahead and take a
look at xoops.org, I'm not going to go into details here except to highlight
the following - I primarily use three web based cms systems for sites I
manage and develop, and as far as advising clients. They are (in order of
complexity) wordpress, xoops, and typo3. For most 'simple' sites I use WP it
provides plenty of functionality. When a more powerful solution is required
(heavy reliance on complex functionality provided by things like osCommerce,
phpAdds, etc) I use xoops. I bring up xoops as an example because the
"plugin" called a module at xoops architecture is really tight. It is very
rigid, in that all "modules" are installed by the xoops backend system and
are controlled tightly. In many ways I like the Wp system better, it's
really lightweight ant flexible, however it leaves room for lots of problems
- for example, when you "deactivate" a wp plugin, if the plugin created any
db tables/rows, etc. the uninstall process at WP doesn't force the plugin to
clean up after itself, by contrast all xoops modules must clean up after
themselves if "uninstalled".  xoops also provides an "update" mechanism for
modules, although most module authors don't make use of the capability to
provide automattic updates, and It's not "forced" by xoops, it is there if
someone wishes to use it. As many of you may be aware, wordpress (currently
up to v 2.0.2) is available as a xoops module, a site can even be
constructed for example, where it appears to be running on WP, but is back
ended by xoops. Many of my sites operate in this manner. Full wp plugin
capability is of course supported. However, security wise, the xoops system
overrides the wp system, so that the types of "holes" we've been discussing
here are eliminated (so far as I have been able to test). I bring this up
because maybe it's time to consider a somewhat more rigid plugin system that
would enforce certain rules, which would eliminate potential holes created
by plugins. The idea of an optional notification or update system which
provides some type of notice or update capability through the dashboard is a
great idea, although wouldn't need to be forced upon users or plugin
authors. Plugin authors however would be required to write their plugins so
that they pass "install" and "uninstall" checks which would be designed to
ensure that they a) don't expose the security issues, and b) clean up after
themselves. This approach really takes the worry off of the plate of users,
and the responsibility off of the plate of the wordpress community and
places it with the plugin author instead, which is where it belongs in the
first place. In other words, if you want to hack something into your own WP
install, go right ahead, however as a community, we're not going to let you
allow users to install a plugin that doesn't meet our 'standards'. Which as
I would define them are 1) Plugin meets security requirements and checks
during activation/install and 2)Plugin cleans up after itself if a user
uninstalls/deactivates. Then optional plugin features become, 1)
update/patch notification via dashboard and 2) update capability from
"manage plugins". 

This requires some work on the part of the WP community to implement:
1) The plugin checks for security and cleanup/uninstall features needs to be
written/implemented in the plugin code. 
2) An interface for "update/patch" notification through the dashboard needs
to be implemented. 
3) An interface for updates via "manage plugins" needs to be implemented. 

Beyond that, WP in itself is a pretty secure environment if implemented
properly as it is, which is why I'm quite comfortable advising clients to
migrate from other systems to WP, or to use it as a simple CMS system for
their sites. Using this type approach, the WP development community can
focus on improving WP, performance, new features, etc. as opposed to
worrying about these other issues. And, as I mentioned in a previous post,
something like the FUD type posts can easily be addressed as - WP is a
secure environment, and checks all plugins prior to install against WP
security requirements.

Actually it went to the "no one is willing to work on this right now" 
bin, it's obviously a good idea we want to do someday. This isn't a bad
thing, good ideas tend to continually resurface, it's darwinian.

Anyone can and has created cool services or enhancements that get official
blessing later, like the new themes site or plugins that we've included over
the years. Usually the constraining factor is personal commitment behind the
idea, not resources or infrastructure or holy water.

It is saved as a plaintext (.xml or .rdf preferable) file on any server
anywhere. In the plugin itself:
/* 
Plugin Name: CompleteRSS 
Plugin URI: http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=2 
Update URI: http://neosmart.ath.cx/CompleteRSS.xml 
Description: CompleteRSS makes sure your RSS Feeds contain full article text
and are fully valid - because your readers deserve it! 
Version: 0.2 
Author: Computer Guru 
Author URI: http://neosmart.net/blog/
*/

Notice the line of added meta data: "Update URI"

On the server-side I've finished a script that cycle through all installed
plugins, search for "Update URI" metadata, and if found, query the XML/RDF
file, check if a new version is available, and return the result.

Before I take this any further:
Is this OK or not? I don't want to put weeks into it and find out there is
no interest.

I can prolly really soon get a working version of this that has _very_ basic
auto-update and auto-install and auto-remove features included. It'll simply
grab a remote plain-text file, save it as a PHP file on the local server in
the plugins DIR.
On update it will delete the old file and save the new.
On uninstall it will delete the old file.

I don't have anything in my head yet as to the best way of creating an
(un)install routine for anything more complex than this; such as
(un)installing database tables or multiple file plugins.

Source code available on demand, ask and you shall receive. And no, it's not
a plugin, it's a wp-core file.

What about support for multiple WP Versions?

Some plugins exists at different versions for different WP Versions -
for example taking advantage of new features with a rewrite while still
keeping the old version available for people using old WP Versions.

It is interesting, as have been the other update methods.

I would prefer to see the option of multiple different types of update
uri so as to support formats other than rdf.

This post from the last time we discussed auto-updating sums up my ideas
in this area
(http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-February/004637.html)

What do you mean by auto-remove?  Your not suggesting WordPress
automatticly disables plugins based on information from an external
source are you - that's a surefire way to break sites!

Surely uninstall should use the builtin deactivate-plugin hooks???

Why not attach it to a ticket on trac as a patch for all to see?

This is looks as if it is heading in the right direction. Perhaps you could
add an Install/Remove URI as well. This URI could be executable php or
something that actually performs the install/removal of the plugin.

I've started an Auto-Update-Plugin half a year ago too but decided to
stop it when I saw that there was already another one. My idea was
similar to the concept from Computer Guru, but I extended the RSS feed
with some special tags:

The idea was to code an additional WordPress plugin which allows
plugin developers to announce the new plugin versions directly via
their blog feed. The plugin would add some fields to the post form
(the values above) and the author could use
http://www.theblog.com/category/pluginOne/feed as the update feed.
So you don't need to manage several feeds / files for the same data.
The feed would also support different WordPress and PHP versions so it
could display a message to the user like "The best version of this
plugin for your blog is 1.2, if you upgrade to WordPress 2.0.4 you
could also use the brand-new-super-featured 1.5".

I mean auto-uninstall routines - there will be activate plugin, deactivate
plugin, and delete plugin.. the latter of which completely wipes all
residues and deletes the files.

I want to keep this simple, no multiple URI's the plugin file itself should
contain the install and uninstall routines, not reference another external
RDF which in turn calls upon another document with install/uninstall steps.

About the different plugin versions: I think if you have a plugin for 1.5
and 2.0 that are different, and are both still actively developed, the most
logical thing is to have two separate RDFs for both - in essence making them
separate plugins, that way the RDF only provides relevant info.

I'm glad this has some support :-)

An important question: does WP need a script that can _make_ these RDF
files? I mean, is it in the role of WP, or should this be an external
script?

ATM I'm just going to focus on setting up this new API, making it work, and
I guess we can go from there.

There _is_ one thing that puts us at a big disadvantage: in order to
autoupdate, we'd have to assume that fopen and fwrite are available, at
least I don't know of any other way to replace the old version of the plugin
with a new one... and quite a few hosts block fopen and fwrite.

Even worse, we're going to have a real headache with n00bs coming in with
wrong permissions all over the place until some 'godsend' teaches them how
to do chmod 777 * -R and makes an even bigger mess of things.

Firefox can create and delete files on the fly, but this _is_ going to be
hard.

Does anyone have any ideas for how one would circumvent this? I don't think
the standard WP "If this file were writable you could save this.." dialog is
enough....

For now that's what I'm going to go for, it'll attempt fwrite, if it can
that's dandy, but if it can't we're going to have to spit the plugin file to
the screen for the user to cut and paste on their own - ugh.

Any suggestions?

I love the tags. (OT: I love your Sitemap generator too - I always forget I

I'm trying to make the feed as efficient as possible, so I just have a
channel author instead of an author for each version - there shouldn't be a
need to repeat that tag for every item.

It's prolly a good idea to include min/max WordPress versions, but _please_
let's not have the maxversion defined by default - look at Firefox: for
every new version all plugins need a rewrite. Maxversion should *only* be
used when it has been 100% verified that the plugin is broken in a higher
version - innocent until proven guilty.

Why purposefully introduce stability issues? Assume plugins are broken 
until they are confirmed as working, at which point the max version 
number gets bumped.

Because that's what the FF devs assumed and now it's a big mess (yes, I do
contribute code to the FF project too).

Let me ask you this: 
ATM does WP check if the plugin is compatible? No.
Has it been a catastrophe? No.

999 times out of 1000 a plugin won't break because of a new version. To
assume it's broken means you're going to have a lot of people crying when
that new version comes out... but none of that matters because:

Plugin devs are lazy. Let's face it, we're not willing to maintain a plugin
unless there is a serious bug or we have some tasty new features to add -
but to have to update the plugin file with every new WP version is not nice.

For what it's worth, I agree with Rob
Lazy or not - surely it's a responsibility.

A lot of people seemed to appreciate the 2.0.2 > 2.0.3 files I made  
up, especially those doing multiple upgrades where FTP is the only  
access method, so I made them again for the 2.0.3 > 2.0.4 upgrade

I think the whole max version should be wiped out. A plugin usually breaks
when the user isn't using a recent version that doesn't have feature that
the plugin uses. Most times I see a plugin that only works for 2.0 and it
doesn't work for 1.5. As long as the basic API for plugins doesn't change
much, it won't be necessary to have.

Maybe there should be some tests setup that determine if the plugin is
compatible (checking hooks, etc.) and then alert that user that the plugin
isn't compatible and disable it and tell them to get a more recent version
if it's available.

WP 2.1 is going to break plugins with some of its database changes.   
Incomplete API leads to deep-reaching plugins which will break when  
things change.  But this isn't something that a plugin author is  
likely to know ahead of time, so I agree that a max version header in  
a plugin is of little use.  I HATE how Firefox disables things, and  
wouldn't want that kind of behavior in WordPress.  However, such a  
check could be done on server side.  That is, when a new WP version  
comes out and an old plugin is found to be broken, it could be  
flagged appropriately on the update server, and the plugin could be  
disabled, or a notice put up (assuming that its brokenness doesn't  
kill the wp-admin, as is sometimes the case).

Not every WP version. It is a reasonable presumption that a plugin that 
works with 2.0.3 will work with 2.0.4, for example; the problem comes 
with the jump from 2.0 to 2.1, which was certainly a problem 1.5->2.0.

So, the best option is to force plugin authors to specify a max version, 
but allow them to use wildcards. I mean, something massively massively 
simple like filtering the_content and replacing X with Y will, with 
99.999% certainty, work no matter what; so, let the author put a 
MinVersion of 1.5 and a MaxVersion of *. A more complex plugin that 
hooks into a lot of WP's functionality, however, cannot easily rely on 
future compatibility, so give it a MinVersion of 1.5 and a MaxVersion of 
2.0.*, for example.

Are you planning on some sort of timeout function for reading these feeds?
SMF uses something similar in their forum software and the problem is when
you go to the admin front page, where the check is performed, sometimes
there site is down and you end up waiting 2 or 3 minutes for that page to
load. Considering there are people who don't renew domains/hosting packages
or just give up all together, it would be nice to timeout the connection
some how, or flag plugins that have feeds that are no longer there.

I'm trying to make the feed as efficient as possible, so I just have a
channel author instead of an author for each version - there shouldn't be a
need to repeat that tag for every item.

It's prolly a good idea to include min/max WordPress versions, but _please_
let's not have the maxversion defined by default - look at Firefox: for
every new version all plugins need a rewrite. Maxversion should *only* be
used when it has been 100% verified that the plugin is broken in a higher
version - innocent until proven guilty.

I know Mark Jaquith made those changed files packages for the last two
releases of WordPress. I was wondering on how people would think if it were
an official package released along side of the release? If you have seen
phpBB, you know what I'm talking about. They have a changed file release
that you can download for modded out boards. I figure it would be easier to
be a part of the official announcements and it should be available on the
download page instead of be announced on the list.

I don't know if this would want to be started with 2.1 or not. It would be
incremental. Like if there was 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 released, there should be a
patch for 2.1 to 2.1.2 and a patch from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2. It would be easier
than having to different packages or even more depending on how far behind
the person is on updating. I still see WP blogs on ZDnet and elsewhere with
1.5 and 1.3 installed! These diffs could be easily made with subversion and
then just zip'd and/or tar'd.

I'm still at version 0.1 and nowhere near done even thinking it through -
thanks for bringing this up though, esp. with what we've seen from ping-wait
issues, it's not going to be pretty.

The plan is to have a 3 second timeout after DNS resolve. Generally
speaking, this should be good since most servers are hosted at companies
with OC-48+ connections. I'm thinking of adding an option for the timeout,
but all that comes later.

More importantly, this isn't going to happen on visiting the admin center,
and won't happen for all plugins at once. It'll simply be "check this plugin
once a week" kind of thing, and use the wp-cron for the checking - so you'll
just visit the plugin page and "OMG, SK2 has a new version! Cool, let's OK
the update..."

I'm thinking in terms of a 3-strikes-you're-out failure checks. Basically,
if a plugin doesn't read up 3 times in a row, it'll be flagged. It is then
up to the user to decide whether or not the plugin should be checked in the
future.

Just a thought...

I run the 2.1 SVN at all times. I have a _lot_ of plugins. Most changes
required but a db-query variable change and they were up and running again -
that easy.

I agree with your POV 100% - It should be flagged as incompatible only when
the dev deems it to be so. My way of tackling this problem is by keeping the
maxversion field, but in the API docs making it clear that this field should
ONLY be used _if and only when_ the plugin is verified broken.

The RDF generator will not have a "Max WP version" field, but rather a "This
plugin breaks if used on a WP version above:" field - to discourage the
overzealous.

Wouldn't it be easier for them just to use SVN? I guess it wouldn't hurt 
to offer patches too, though :)

I think this is a great idea, especially for people who have had to hack the
core files. I am one of those and had to do some minor hacks on the large
sites I manage. It also makes upgrading easier to just go through and upload
the changed files only, instead of the entire core.

I use SVN, but many people don't have SSH or SVN available to them.
If they have SSH but no SVN it's just as easy to wget or lftpget the new
version and unzip I guess....

Are they using some sort of PHP Patcher web-accessible script? Because other
than that they have SSH access...

Unless this is for *trying* (read: failing) to merge differences they've
made to their source?

The last thing I want is some cron job checking for updates. I would be nice
if it could be kick-started from an admin page similar to the database
backup. Is wp-cron another plugin? If so, I would advise against relying on
another plugin to do something you can do yourself in a different way that
makes more sense to the end user.

I would think that at the very least, the plugin could be marked unstable
similar to many linux distributions. The end user could then choose to
install unstable packages at their own risk.

No, I'm talking about the in-built cron (the one giving us hell with future
posting). If you look back at my message carefully, the reason is simple: no
end-user timeouts.

There _will_ be a user-clickable "check for updates" button, but the main
system should be the wp cron, believe me, when you have a site with over 50
plugins, you don't want to be on the waiting end.

That's not bad:
"This plugin hasn't been verified working on this version of WP. Do you want
to continue?"

But, the problem is when you _upgrade_ to a new version of WP, and find your
old plugins suddenly disabled - that's what I don't like.

WP has come a _long_ way since the 1.5 days, we're reaching out more, and
plugin devs are more aware of changes and less 'lazy.'
I don't see the need to fix something that isn't broken. Let plugin authors
verify a plugin is broke.

Now, there -is- another option, but I don't like it: a central server. But
the whole goal of RDF over XML-RC was to avoid centralized nonsense and
delays. I'd rather we just took our chances with only marking verified broke
plugins as such, and left it otherwise untouched. This solution is far more
elegant, much cheaper, and not dependant on one server - remember what
happened when wp-plugins.org went down?

For the update script I'm looking for a way to compare version numbers - but
they're not numbers.

echo bloginfo('version')

returns 2.1-alpha2

Which I _can't_ compare to 2.1-beta1 and get the right answer. 

Is there a hack for this?

Yeah, but if I have a site with 5 plugins, the cron script seems like such a
hassle. Checking for plugin updates shouldn't be a problem. Perhaps the
plugin versions could be maintained by WP itself (as a feed from
wordpress.org or something). Checking to see if there is a new version
should really be maintained by one machine, rather than having each
individual developer do this. This is how I see it working, regardless of
how many plugins you have:

Login as admin, go to the Plugins->Update page.
>From there, it queries the centralized wordpress feed that has the version
information (including stability versioning).
The user sees instantly that there is an update and can decide to take
action.
The user updates an arbitrary number of plugins.
The 'in-progress' bar shows up as it uses the meta-data to find the latest
zip/tarball, downloads it, and installs it.

Lets try and keep this as simple to use as possible. It is also very
important to keep tasks like this consistant. If I would update my plugins,
I would expect it to act similar to backing up my database.

Timeouts should not be a concern, timeouts happen with websites all the
time, that doesn't mean I want a cron job to visit the site for me while I
sleep.

Maybe you can use sr_replace and just take out the -alpha2 part. That suffix
isn't in the final version.

Works like a dream - I didn't know it was valid for text too.
Thanks!
(But I don't see the need for var_dump... is there a special reason you put
it there? I just have version_compare thrown in an if statement)

I just put it in to test it, as I wasn't sure "alpha2" would work (I 
knew "alpha-2" worked, but not without the dash).

About the install and uninstall routines, is this OK?

We'll support three functions:
+Upgrade
+Install
+Remove

Upon successfully deleting the old plugin file and replacing it with the new
one, the server will GET myplugin.php?upgrade

And the same for the rest.

Upgrade/Install/Remove routines will be just pure PHP that will require
_zero_ user intervention. If user input is needed, it should be asked for
upon first run (for install only, the rest shouldn't need anything anyway).

Also, I need some suggestions on handling multi-file plugins.
Do we define some more metadata, say "chainloaded files:" that will be
downloaded along with the plugin, or do we ....?

ATM I'm 100% done with the "Dynamic Plugin Manager" page which successfully
queries an RDF, checks version compatibility with WP and PHP, and gets a
short description of changes. It offers a user an option to upgrade to the
new version, which upon clicking it replaces the old file's contents with
the new ones. It doesn't require DB access at all thus far.

I'll be posting the code as soon as I add some form of "RDF creator" or the
other... tonight or tomorrow hopefully.

For the most part it's just one new file, and minor changes to 3 or 4 others
to pass along extra meta-data and stuff.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Trouble while Adding Caps to WP
Message-ID: <001501c6b407$de4ff2b0$9aefd810$@net>

I changed 'upgrade-schemas.php' from

	// Add caps for Administrator role
	$role = get_role('administrator');
	$role->add_cap('switch_themes');
	$role->add_cap('edit_themes');
	$role->add_cap('activate_plugins');

To

	// Add caps for Administrator role

	$role->add_cap('switch_themes');
	$role->add_cap('edit_themes');
	$role->add_cap('activate_plugins');
	$role->add_cap('manage_plugins');

And ran upgrade.php

However, when I call this function:

if (!current_user_can('manage_plugins'))
	wp_die('<p>'.__('You do not have sufficient permissions to edit
plugins for this blog.').'</p>');

while logged in as 'admin' I get the not enough permissions error.


Am I doing something wrong? AFAIK, caps are listed in 'upgrade-schemas.php'
and are saved to the db by running upgrade.php.... but it's not working.

Any advice?

Why not check for updates every week as a background process, maybe
within the sutdown function and save the result in the database. The
results could be displayen on the dashboard like "There is an update
available for 2 plugins". I'm too lazy to check the update page every
week by myself ;)

Querying the update server in the background every week also takes
away the possibility that users could hammer the update server with
clicking repeatedly on the "check" button.

Why not use the existing http://wp-plugins.net/ (.net!) database? I
think a high percentage of the available plugins is already registered
there. Sure, the admin interface to manage your plugins as well as the
API is a bit ugly, but that's changeable.

Best regards,

  Arne Brachhold

You should be able to export out an OPML list via:

http://myblog.tld/wp-links-opml.php

WordPress will import that as well thru the wp-admin side.

hope this helps,

OK, so upgrade.php calls upgrade_functions.php, which calls
admin_functions.php and upgrade-schema.php. It looks like upgrade_160 is
only called when the database version is less than 3308. If your database
version is greater than that, then it won't call it, and the roles won't be
added.

Surely this should be a normal wordpress hook like the activate
deactivate ones - that would be a more standard way of achieving this.

So you would have a call like the following in the upgrade process after
the new file had been downloaded and installed:

do_action('upgrade_' . trim( $_GET['plugin'] ));

The download link could be a zip file which just gets unzipped.

That would work :)

> The download link could be a zip file which just gets unzipped.

I guess that would work.. That would require either exec() support or php
compiled with zip...
It can unlink() recursively the plugin directory.
We must make it clear though that _any_ plugin with more than one file (even
a readme) should have it's own DIR no matter what - then we can unlink and
be sure we're doing the right thing.

Hello,

I've been looking for a modern (clean XHTML/CSS/JS,
not-just-for-the-sake-of-it Ajax), highly-configurable and
easily-configurable (i.e. as much thought has gone into the Options UI as
into the theme itself, so average users can have sites that look very
different) style for my site.

K2 probably comes closest, but the Options page is very light, and there's a
significant dependence on external plug-ins for what I would consider basic
functionality.

I've been sketching out ideas a true "next-gen" style.  Before I dive in, is
there anybody on the list that would consider this duplicate work?  Second,
are there folks who would like to partner with me on this and/or test?

So, basically what you're saying is that you wan't a new default wordpress
design? And then added customizable features like the widgets or how you can
change the header color in Kubrick?

On the other hand there are over 1300 plugins registered there. Of
course there are more plugins available, but it's the largest
available plugin database so why not use it?

The simple answer is that we don't need to. We can get the plugin info
straight from the authors, so why should we go through a middle-man?

Definitely definitely seconding this. Every single third-party site that 
collects together community efforts I've ever seen (wp-plugins.net, the 
various Firefox plugin sites etc) has been consistently slow at getting 
updated, whether, in the case of author-updated sites, through the 
authors forgetting (as is certainly the case with my plugins and 
wp-plugins.net) or in the case of the sites updating things just a 
general laxness.

By contrast, I've never seen an author's site that wasn't up-to-date, 
which is a natural presumption since they are invariably the primary 
download site.

As long as the second site can use the opml  file  it  works  fine.

At least the update check would work with all plugins already
registered there. A centralized structure should be also more reliable
than the authors sites. Sites move, get deleted, get out of bandwidth
etc. How would an updater deal with that?
A centralized server (maybe supported by automattic?) could run
forever and avoid these issues.

Another point is that most bloggers (and plugin authors) have
low-budget web accounts (me too) with limited bandwidth and I don't
want that plugin update checks eat it up.

Maybe this would change if there is an updater plugin. As an plugin
developer I want to notify my existing users about changes and such a
plugin is a very good way for that. Of course there needs to be a
large user base of the plugin so that this happens.

Firefox _has_ a plugin update checker and it hasn't helped there.

Actually, that's exactly why we're not doing it that way. Individual sites
on a whole are more stable - like I said, look what happened when the
_Automattic_ site wp-plugins.org went down. Look how slow pingomatic and
akisemt are.

Don't worry about bandwidth, the files are tiny - but here is a better idea:
You approach Dr. Dave (who is a great guy!) and tell him:
"Can you please have your site auto-create the RDF download bulletins that
are compatible with WP 2.1's new plugin system?"

Then your plugin file can point to his server anyway.

I hope to get together with a couple other people to create a very
customizable, very easy-to-use new theme that does everything the average
enthusiast would want to do without having to resort to editing text files.

It wouldn't be created under the assumption that it /would/ replace the
default theme, but it has to be more than good enough that it could.

Widget support would be a basic requirement, as would the ability to
customize all theme colors/gradients and images without having to resort to
a text editor.  Some other internal guidelines off the top of my head:

	- Great user experience for authors and readers
		- Ajax everywhere it improves the UE
		- Excellent support for mobile clients, too
	- Allow authors to create radically-different looks/feels without
editing code
	- Support for popular services built-in
		- FeedBurner, AdSense, YPN, Digg, Reddit, etc.

As far as I can tell, there's nothing that offers the experience that I'd
personally like to see.

I don't have a mobile phone with web access, but I gather that the
javascript support might be lackluster (I'm not sure about this though).
Where specifically would the ajax be implemented? Some popular services are
already in use in some templates. Like some automatically put the "digg
this" and technorati tags in.

A lot of the services can be built in using widgets (adsense setup etc). I
think the theme package should come with the widget plugin and then when the
template is activated, it checks to see if the plugin is activated. I think
that widgets should become part of the wordpress core, but I know everyone
will disagree because we don't want to bloat wordpress with code.

Hi,
I just took a look at the opml stuff, it doesn't export descriptions. is
there a way to export links with descriptions?

This couldn't be more wrong. A single authorative site can be load balanced.
Where as, if a developer who self hosts creates a popular plugin, he will
likely not be able to handle the traffic. His ISP will complain, his machine
may put on the brakes. This is generally a bad idea. In fact, I believe it
will discourage weekend warriors from developing plugins. Other centeralized
sites did not work for one reason and one reason only: out of the box
support for automatic plugin management. It was up to the site maintainer to
maintain installation rules and plugin lists.

If I had to host the updates and host the plugin, I would be less inclined
to publish this content from my site. If there were a site I could update
with my new plugin version and the installation rules, I would spend less
time getting my plugin to the end users and more time developing. That is
what really matters to the content developers.

Besides, I've been saying from the get-go that the plugin installation rules
could be php exec() sort of thing. Why should the maintainers define the
installation routines, let the developers implement a common interface.

The Installer plugin uses the dUnzip2 lib which uses the zlib extension. 
   Anything that uses exec() is unlikely to go in core.

I'm just wondering, what external plugins does K2 require that should be
"basic functionality". They aren't bundled with K2 IMO because rewriting the
code for that purpose (e.g. del.icio.us integration) would be reinventing
the wheel (lots of del.icio.us plugins out there already). K2 is just the
theme -- if you want extra stuff you have to install a plugin. Just like any
other theme.

Don't worry - it won't.
For the most part I'm recycling little-used bits of WP code...
I don't see a need (as a plugin dev) for exec. The same way I always used to
install my plugin I can do it now, and uninstall it too.

Look at UTW. It's really complicated and is a perfect example of something
with hooks the whole way through. It's installed with one click. All we want
is a way to tie in that install to the new 'install' hook.

About the servers - I don't get it. People try to get traffic to their
sites. If you put up a site and write a popular plugin - you should accept
the need for a better host. I'm talking from experience too, my articles
have had my host scream and complain when they made Slashdot and digg, but I
didn't think Slashdot was a bad idea because of it, I put up a donation link
and ads instead - then I upgraded servers.

The RDF file doesn't need to be more than one entry long. That's LESS than
ONE kb. Is that _really_ a problem?
If you need hosting that bad I can host your RDF for you or anybody else :)

Actually, with regards to specifically the delicious plugin, we just
took out support for this weekend (and put in support for some new
stuff):

http://k2.stikipad.com/docs/show/Supported+Plugins

And yes, Robin is right, why throw in code, which we would then have
to maintain, unless absolutely necessary?

Some widgets (namely Kings' widgets) have that option, but for the rest it's
quite easy, but requires some PHP work:

if (is_page()) {
sidebar code here
}

Where "is_page" is normally something like "is_404" or "is_home" or
something. The whole list can be found in the codex.

Why do you say this?  You can register multiple "sidebars."  I have a
theme that does just that.

Check for fopen() support and try to fall back on curl() if it's disabled.

...or just use Snoopy, which is included with WP.

indeed, but you cannot put the exact same widget in two sidebars. the only
solution at the moment is the one indicated by Computer Guru, and it is
everything but reasonable for a tech unsavvy person.

You're completely correct, and so the mobile render would be quite plain.
Feeds are really the right model for mobile blog reading, so this aspect
would represent a fairly small amount of work...just enough so that phones
with simple browsers (but that can't accommodate an feed reader for any
reason) can browse to sites and get something useful (albeit not pretty)
with as small a payload as possible.

Absolutely, and presumably any plug-ins and widgets done as part of this
project could be useful in other themes.

To Robin and Dave, obviously I'm a K2 fan, and I participated in earlier
betas.  I won't be reinventing any wheels that I don't have to, but this
project will target a very different class of users.

I am trying to come up with a method to allow certain users to edit comments
on any post. These people will be "comment moderators". They should have
access to only editing and deleting of comments on any post.

I have been trying to come up with a method to do this, short of writing a
whole plugin replicating the comment editing functions set to a user_cap of
comment_moderation. I have tried playing with the user_has_cap filter, but
am reaching a dead end in coming up with a way to get the manage->comments
menu/screen to pop up for these people. 

I figured I would ask the great minds here to see if anyone has any idea on
an easier way of doing this then re-inventing (or copying and pasting) the
comment editing functions.

Greets

I've not found one.  It doesn't export out image links either.
(Categories as well I think) I don't think that they're included in
the OPML format.

You could rewrite the file in question to export the needed
information but I do not believe that an importer would support it
unless you rewrote that as well.

I know that WP imports the info (as I imported my OPML file from Gregarius
(my RSS reader on my server)), it just may be a case of not exporting the
info from WP.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Looking for a time-based content plugin
Message-ID: <A2318A5A-5246-4CB1-AAA6-CE6CC7AA7A9F@codehooligans.com>

Greetings all. Happy Monday.

So late tonight (2am Tuesday CST) I have to go in a client's  
MovableType setup and removed all references to a campaign which ends  
July 31. This will involve changes to the template for the home page  
and sidebar. Should take me about 1.5 hours.

So it got me thinking about my other clients who use WP and the drive  
to automate as much as possible. Is there some plugin for WP that  
would perform this action form me?  Meaning have some content  
automatically display depending on a date/time range?

Is anyone aware of something even close to this that I could extend  
for my own needs?

P-
