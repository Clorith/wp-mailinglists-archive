This seems to be a question for the <a

What variables are you POSTing? It's possible that they're interfering
with variables WordPress uses internally, hence the 404. Try the query
diagnostics plugin.

You're a genius, the contact form 'name' variable was interfering  
with a query variable with the same name. changed it to 'cf_name' and  
everything is working now. thanks a million.

I know some feel this has been a dead horse, but now that I'm working with
2.1 more, I have a better grasp on the issue at hand.

Currently, with 2.1 if I run wp_list_cats, the "blogroll" category shows
up.  If that behavior is to be normal, then I definitely think another term
should be used, though it is my opinion that category should be excluded
from that tag by default.  Otherwise, I envision numerous threads in the
support forums asking how to remove it.

I think having a sub-category of "links" called blogroll would be more
appropriate, with the admin tab reflecting the more general term.

Logically a category shouldn't be displayed by list_cats unless it has
one+ posts. Categories with links alone should be excluded, *unless*
you set the 'hide_empty' argument to false.

Perhaps we need a new param in list_cats which lets you include/exclude
link categories.

Which explains the behavior I'm experiencing.  I  gave that  a thought after
I posted, but hadn't tested it yet.

Perhaps we need a new param in list_cats which lets you include/exclude
> link categories.


Which would make sense, but once users start using the same category for
both posts and links, it would create more confusion.
Almost a six of one half dozen another...

Thanks for the reply.

I agree. A low-traffic, just RC's and releases, mailing list such as
wp-announce. Anyone from Auttomatic want to comment?

Um, what about an RSS feed?
I mean, we're WP, and we don't do RSS feeds for release? Not Mailing lists, no need for two way communication.

Those that want emails can sign up via one of the hundred RSS-mailers (feedburner's the best). No maintenance, and anyone that wants out just stops reading/synching.

I agree. There's no need for any two-way communication at all; RSS feeds
would be fine :)

Oh, yaeh, marvelous stuff!

We now  have to learn not only the URN, URL and URI, but the IRI as well.
Not to mention, how to map an IRI to a URI, or is it EURO ;)

Very natural though, that US-ASCII cannot be the limit for ever.

Message-ID: <122d4b4d0611021443n2c56508bycb9c17d3420f523e@mail.gmail.com>

I'm muddling my way through customizing a random post plugin to output the
excerpt of a post with a read more link.  Currently it's only working if I
put a manual excerpt in the post, how can I automatically output the
excerpt.

Here's the code I'm using:
$listContent =    stripslashes(str_replace('"', '',
$display->post_excerpt));

                //    Set up the return string
                if ( $before ) $result    .=    $before;
                $result  .=    '<a href="' . post_permalink($display->ID) .
'" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to &quot;' . $listTitle . '&quot;">'
. $listTitle . '</a>'  . '<br />' . $listContent . '<a href="' .
post_permalink($display->ID) . '" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to
&quot;' . $listTitle . '&quot;">' . ' Read more' . '</a>' ;

Currently I'm simply pulling the field via
$postSQL =  "SELECT
$wpdb->posts.post_excerpt";

Thanks for any help.

Why do it manually?

Use the_content() to grab the post of your liking. It'll take care of all
that for you. 

To use the_content() just first run the SQL query that picks the post
number(s), then activate the_content() or get_the_content() depending on
your needs.

Well, as I said, I'm muddling my way through this.  But I'm not trying to
get the content, rather the excerpt.  I can output the content via the
method I'm using now.

Yeah, but the_content does just that.
It outputs the excerpt + a read more link.

I'm quite familiar with template tags, but don't know how to call it from
within the plugin, particularly within the code I'm using.

Only if I manually add the more tag.  I might as well use the optional
excerpt as I'm currently doing.

I wrote a plug-in for my own use that does some of this.  What I did was
look at the_excerpt() and get_the_excerpt() and modeled it off that.
Really not hard.  You get the content, run the default content filters
on that, then truncate it.

It wouldn't need to be maintained... just have announcements only, no posts.
So just like a one-way thing. As for the RSS feed, I think that's part of
what the dashboard does, but I know many people that have disabled or don't
look at their dashboard.

Or we could have a -announce list (read-only) and also have an RSS feed in
that. So people who read their email more than check their Bloglines can
have it where they will be the most, and vice versa.

there's already supposed to be an announce list -- I'd be happy to subscribe 
to that, and maintaining it is basically no work (the whole list system is 
in place already).

separately, why the aren't such announcements just cc'd to ALL lists that 
might be important for?  Only reason I can see is not to duplicate 
messaging -- then again, if we had a list that was just for such messages, 
that'd be good. ;)

Like others, I'm not subscribed to testers.  I get enough traffic from 
hackers as it is. ;)  I WOULD however love to subscribe to a low-use list 
(or RSS if needed) that was just for alpha, beta, release-candidate, and 
release notices.  I'd find that most useful.

The upgrade code takes care of it.  There's a function that compares  
your current DB schema with the schema in upgrade-schema.php and  
performs any ALTER calls needed to bring it up to spec.

If you're curious, the function is dbDelta() on line 447 of upgrade- 
functions.php  It's pretty handy!

I've been working with Michael Adams on fleshing out the readme.txt  
format, and have built a parser/validator/dingus for the currently  
proposed version.

You can access the readme parser here:
http://covered.be/readme-validator/

It accepts copy-paste or a readme.txt URL

Some of the changes:

- "Minimum version" and "tested with" have been renamed to improve  
natural language flow and clarification (i.e. "tested with") implies  
that's the only version that's been tested.

New versions:

Requires at least: 2.0
Tested up to: 2.1

- We're moving the full description into its own section, and having  
the old description area act as a markup-less 150 char summary.  If  
the new == Description == section doesn't exist, the old one will be  
used as a fallback (which makes this new format backwards compatible  
with the originally proposed format)

- "Stable tag" can refer to either a Subversion tag, or "trunk" (if  
you put your stable version in trunk).  Obviously, the readme.txt for  
your in-development version should be changing as your plugin  
matures, so if you point to a stable tag, it is that readme.txt  
that'll be used as the defining one for your plugin.  That allows you  
to develop in trunk, updating the /trunk/readme.txt to document new  
features, without disturbing the readme.txt of your designated stable  
tag.

Here is an ideal readme.txt, according to the proposed format that  
Mike and I came up with.  Let me know if you find any shortcomings in  
the parser, or if you have any clarification questions.






=== Plugin Name ===
Contributors: markjaquith, mdawaffe
Tags: comments, spam
Requires at least: 2.0.2
Tested up to: 2.1
Stable tag: 4.3

Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more  
than 150 chars.  No markup here.

== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as  
well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full  
length of the short description will be used, and Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

* "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org  
usernames
* "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
* "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
* "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully  
used to test the plugin.*  Note that it might work on higher  
versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
* Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest  
stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for stable.  Note  
that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered  
the defining one for the plugin, so if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file  
says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt`  
that'll be used for displaying information about the plugin.  In this  
situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt` is  
the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can  
update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in your in- 
development version, without having that information incorrectly  
disclosed about the current stable version that lacks those changes  
-- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable  
tag.  If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is  
stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where you put the  
stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

Ordered list:

1. Some feature
1. Another feature
1. Something else about the plugin

Unordered list:

* something
* something else
* third thing

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= A question that someone might have =

An answer to that question.

= What about foo bar? =

Answer to foo bar dilemma.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg| 
jpeg|gif)  Note that the screenshot is taken from the directory of  
the stable readme.txt, so in this case, `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`  
(or jpg, jpeg, gif)
2. This is the second screen shot

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones  
above.  This may be of use for extremely complicated plugins where  
more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the  
categories of "description" or "installation."  Arbitrary sections  
will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

It prevents caching, namely for upgrading, because the CSS file may have
been changed since the last version.

Because it is giving me a problem with Opera for some reason.
Opera loads it all corrupt and stuff unless I press F5 (viewing the CSS
file). It makes it look like loading binary data in the web browser (like
incorrectly compressed GZIP for instance).

Any thoughts?

Firefox, IE7, they show it right. But no matter what Opera doesn't seem to
render it right the first time.

The next version of Drupal is coming out with a pretty neat theme,

you changes:

http://acko.net/garland/?q=admin/build/themes/settings/garland

This is pretty darn neat. Anyone interested in porting it? The toggle, 
logo, and shortcut icon bits are probably superfluous, but the color 
picking functionality is great.

So it would basically be like the Kubrick header color changer on steroids.
The actual design doesn't look hard to port, but the color picker might be a
challenge.

That's interesting.

I've done that on a few sites; err, without the GET variables. I've
either configured apache to call php for css files or used a php page
for the url in a linked stylesheet.

Example:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://frenzieddaddy.com/stylesheet.php"
type="text/css" />

(If you do this, make sure your php script outputs the text/css header,
duh :) )

I didn't come across any problems with it, but it seemed like ... on
the one hand "great" so that I could define variables (colors, etc) at
the top and adjust them, or adjust them depending on time of day, et
cetera. But it was an added bit of fluff I didn't need.  

Any way, I didn't see problems as you're describing, but maybe either
the errors here or the warnings here cause the strange displays in
Opera?

I love life, it's so full of little coincidences :P

I wrote an article on PHP-as-CSS just last week - but on a different website
:P 
http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/276

Anyway, this is a standard CSS file being sent out as MIME type text, and
only Opera coughs up on it...

It's not anything about (in)valid CSS - this is the default wp-admin CSS for
a WP 2.1 install, and it's the same on all 4 of my servers, it's only this
particular server on Opera alone giving me errors.

OK, this is a bit complicated, and I want a bit help in general ideas  
of how to accomplish this:
I need to set up a section of  of a site that will only be available  
to subscribed users (via paypal or similar) I was thinking about user  
levels, but they're not so flexible anymore (i'd want to give the  
user the a separate level so he/she can read articles in a restricted

subscription part, how would I write a script that will update the  
user level, through some wordpress interface? write directly to the db?
Any direction and help would be appreciated.

I think something like Role Manager 2.0 + custom script that dynamically
changes DB values should do the trick.

Thanks, that might work. the only problem that i forgot to mention is  
that the site will be selling subscriptions, which means i need to be  
able to upgrade accounts but have an "expiry date" any ideas?

OK, then you'll be better off with your own table in the db.
Store the CC details, the start date, expiration date, and user level.
Then correlate that user level to Role Manager.

I believe there are many Paypal purchasing scripts out there, so just tie
that in to your custom script + a plugin for the authenticate module in WP.

Should you need help.......

Isn't  porting  leading  to  perception  of  imitation   and
catch-up?  Personally,  while it's doable, I wouldn't  think
it's  a  wise  idea. It's like  having  Linux  distributions
prepackaged  with  Windows and OS X lookalikes (default,  or
among the themes). Themes become the identity of code that's
otherwise  invisible. It's all happening under the  surface.
At  the  back rooms, it's the brains (e.g. efficiency)  that
counts, not  the 'eye  candy'.   Going back to the  "less is
more" and "code is poetry" mottos...

One nice feature that Drupal offers is a global-type of user
registration,  which  obviates  the need  to  have  multiple
accounts.  I  am unaware of WordPress equivalents,  but  the
WordPress.com joint cookies resemble this.

IBM  have  bee  pushing Drupal quite hard recently.  I  hope
WordPress can shine through as not only a blogging platform,
but  also  as  a proven and self-acclaimed CMS.  The  subtle
implications  are  a peril for those who seek to use it  for
applications  that  it's perfectly able to handle.  As  Mark
says,  "I(we)  can  do that with WordPress".  Why  not  have
WordPress  state  that  rather than Mark  making  that  fair
argument?

I   think  that  PHP  or  ImageMagick  can  do  the   colour
transformation to generate static JPEG's. I can do that with
ImageMagick, but then again, there's  no  assurance the  Web
server has it installed.

Best wishes,

Roy

Simple Way

Just stick a wordpress blog in the password protected section of your
membership site system.

If you want customers to be able to write on an external blog, some kind of
interface between Wordpress and the membership site to share data.


Average complexity

Pickup some sales processing and affiliate software, and latch that onto
Private areas. Optiniche has a very slick integration to private posts based
on member level, with Idevaffiliate backend.

Average complexity 2

I believe you can do a fairly good job with the Semiologic Pro package.
Implementations I have seen still used affiliate packages for order
processing.
I would check with Denis on specifics on what it can and can't do.

Hard Way

Reinvent the wheel for paypal integration, autoresponder integration,
affiliate program, special offers for JV partners , special offers for
customers, access to products based on purchases, tracking, split testing
etc etc


Alternative

Think of using another CMS - I have seen some pretty good Joomla sites,
though they don't have all the commercial features various dedicated systems
offer.

PHP via CSS can take care of that in one line and is guaranteed to work on
all systems/platforms equally.

The mailman archives <

http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers?lnk=li > are pretty fast as  
well. They don't create duplicate content that leads to penalties

No criticism, just an observation, mate.

I never liked mailman :(

Thanks for the info though, I had no idea the GG site was working for
wp-hackers - I thought it was "experimental then dropped" according to some
posts here.
I know of Nabble as well, I just don't like all those bloated interfaces.

God, I've read that thing like 2 times already :D

"WordPress can shine through as not only a blogging platform,
but  also  as  a proven and self-acclaimed CMS."

On the WordPress.org homepage, it says personal publishing platform. I'm
pretty sure that covers cms. Although maybe there could be a wordpress
release that is specially configured (with plugins and such) that makes it
work as a cms right out of the box. This has to go beyond things like static
homepages in 2.1.

See my reply to Russ - it's my copy of Opera acting up. For some weird
reason it first manifested itself in that particular URI - for WP-admin with
the ?.... bit on it. Then it spread.. Like the *plague!*

I like Shaun Inman's approach. It's a little less haphazard, but still
gives the advantages of repeating certain values throughout the CSS:

actually that "reply to russ" was a reply to my off-list message. I
didn't feel the need to clutter the list with a stupid joke :P Here's
his response, snipped from the email (note that the attributions are
cut directly from the email to me, so at the bottom his reply looks
like what I said... 
====================

Thank you Mr. MCSE - just what I was about to do, knowing as I do that
it's running IIS7 and Longhorn Server =P (but you couldn't have
possibly known that! Unless..... It was my cat! He told you!)

As a matter of fact it's my PC that has to be formatted :(
I just experienced the same problem with Firefox.com and OSDir - my
Opera is shot to sh!t and upgrading to 9.1 RC1 didn't help any.
======================

And uh, my MCSE is kind of old and outdated, and I only finished
because I had embarked on the trip. By the time I was done, I preferred
Linux to NT. (Though I'm willing to work on either).

I just set up some links from my plugin pages to the README's I've  
checked in to wp-plugins.org - however the Trac browser seems to be  
acting up.

Example: http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/popularity-contest/trunk/ 
README.txt

returns an empty page (no README content) to me and the root level  
folders don't have links:

http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/

Anyone else seeing similar issues?

Could this be updated to accept README.txt as a valid filename as well?

I'm seeing this too.

It looks like no one has permission to access anything - even when
logged in.

You can still see them via svn though:

Done.

Noticed that on your plugins page, you're linking your readme's to:

	http://svn.wp-plugins.org/browser/popularity-contest/trunk/README.txt

... which is a 404. Need to take out the /browser part:

There is nothing wrong with adding parameters to a .css file call. It's
perfectly valid. So, either A) your server is misconfigured to send the
wrong kind of header or something and only Opera is freaked out by that, or
B) Opera sucks a big one.

Message-ID: <7198728.post@talk.nabble.com>


Sometimes comments get lost, deleted (even by mistake), or you might want to
keep a record of the comments you make on different blogs.

Someone commenting on a blog has to leave an email address, and using some
plugins also has an option to have followup emails sent to them.

This isn't an ideal system - it is actually very dangerous

Here is a better way for it all to be integrated

When you place a comment you have exactly the same interface as it is now.
(with the plugin for followups)

When you post a comment, a copy of what you posted is sent back to you by
email

If you reqested followups to the message, you will be provided with a link
to click to confirm the subscription to the comments.

Comments are only sent to you if you have confirmed it

Some of the code would also be used to confirm signing up as a member to a
blog, before they receive a password.


The current system works, but is liable to spam complaints. Lots of people
using email services like AOL tend to hit the "this is spam" button instead
of the delete button.

This would be especially true if you posted a comment to a post, subscribed,
and then the comments exploded with 500 comments in a few hours (it
happens).

Every implementation of the subscribe to thread I have seen so far doesn't
provide you with a link to remove your subscription.

I deliberately don't use such a plugin on my own domains because what can
happen if you get spam reports is quite nasty.

I think this is something major that needs to be looked at.

This is something I am willing to take on board in the future if noone else
has the inclination / time / resources to do it now. 

I am not sure how complex it will be to do this correctly, or whether my
current programmers are up to the task based on experience to date. In a few
months they will have more familiarity with the core, and it would be a more
realistic undertaking.

The plugins currently available are a liability. Spam complaints can affect
email deliverability, or at worst people's domain names can be frozen,
especially using popular registrars such as Go Daddy.

Go Daddy have every right to protect against spam complaints, but it
shouldn't be caused by Wordpress, or the poor design of existing plugins.

I don't want an email sent to me for every comment I leave on someones
blogs - that is useless info.

This only serves to validate that the commenter owns the email address -
it's a nicety rather than a necessity.

This can only be solved by educating the user - they requested the emails
by checking the check box.

Well as far as I recall Mark's excellent subscribe-to-comments has a link
to manage your subscriptions in the emails it send.

I don't see any of these as being the type of complexity that needs adding
to the core.

There are an aweful lot of sites using a totally different plugin, or older
version.

I have just taken a look at the current version, and I do think at least
that functionality should be included in the core.

It would be much better if it also was linked to the blog membership system.


Another aspect of this is legal documentation on blogs. Privacy, COPPA etc

I would be a major selling point if Wordpress as standard came with a set of
legal documents which would cover most blogging situations.

So you're saying you pick your CMS/Blogging Platforms because they ship with
legal mumbo-jumbo?

I don't think anyone actually gives a damn about COPPA, I have it enabled,
yet my forums are filled with < 13 people. Well, not filled, but seeing as I
haven't received a single COPPA form...

I think that was his point. WordPress is international. It's getting along
just fine the way it is right now without adding region-specic bloat/stuff
no one will ever use. Why add something that not everyone will benefit from
to the core?

If you want COPPA, there are plugins for that. WordPress is *primarily* a
blogging platform, and multiple users are the exception, not the rule for a
blogging platform.
Even more importantly, in most blogs, authors are created by the
administrator, so things like COPPA don't really have a place. Unless you're
talking about comment registration - then COPPA is just a stupid law.

If a < 13 year old can post as anonymous without breaking any laws why
should it be illegal to still post as anonymous except also fill out a
registration sheet?

WP is getting along just fine without these laws, I have 2 forms of email
subscription on my blog and have *never* received a single spam complaint
(and my site is quite large now). 

If it's not broke, don't fix it.

I am not sure WP.com users have the availability of plugins for coppa

I am going through the expense of having documents prepared for my own
business. The wordpress database files have names attached to email
addresses.
Most wordpress users have some form of tracking.
Wordpress.com has tracking

As to jurisdiction, obviously that is a point

Then again, I live in Poland, run my business from the UK, and am still
preparing documents and business practices suitable for the US market,
because I have US customers and US hosting.

I know some very experienced email marketers who had major cash producing
websites shut down simply because one of his affiliates sent a spam email
that included an affiliate ID linking to his site.

What would happen if:-

1. A kid subscribes to comments
2. Spam protection was down for a bit
3. Someone sent lots of porn spam to your blog
4. The porn spam was sent from your domain to the kid

If there is no way to provide it, fair enough.

I am going to have protection either way

Another process idea:

Submit the comment form. The commenter is told to check his email.
WP emails the comment to the commenter's address with some links:
Click here to confirm my identity once.
Click here to confirm my identity for all future comments to this blog.
Click here to cancel this comment.
The comment sits in moderation until the commenter is verified and
pending any other comment spam tests.

For blogs concerned with impersonation, trolls, hotheaded commenters
who think twice and retract their comments...

Could be extended to allow commenters to delete their own comments later.

Plugin?

That process works pretty well too

I would just like some system included that conforms to current email
standards for both commenting and joining a blog. Databases are storing
email addresses, and you can never rule out a security hole.

As an example if I do install Marks plugin somewhere, I will probably adapt
it to have some legal stuff in the messages sent, including real contact
details, as you never know what comments might slip through the spam
filters.

*smile* should be *smirk* instead :P

I like FeedBurner - especially their useful flares and stuff (ok, ok, I'm
desperately looking for something here!)

I give up :D
I've just re-configured the feedburner link to point to Google Groups
instead, that seems to work a bit better :) and with more features.

Seriously though: Google + FeedBurner is a good combo.

It uses the auto-convert feature to serve the content in RSS1/2 or Atom0.3/1

I  actually  thought  about *grin*, but it  has  a  negative
connotation.  Then I thought of *smirk*, which I rarely  use
because  it  sounds  like "smurf". Also reminds  me  of  the
nickname  of someone whom I corresponded with in ICQ when  I
was 14/15. Anyhoo...

FeedBurner  is  a  good  tool for cleaning  up  site  stats,
separating passive readers from the active viewers.

Isn't RSS 1 kind of "legacy"/backward compatibility thing?

I actually Feeds, then Mailing Lists, then NGs last. It's a client kinda
thing. For Feeds there's a million choices for clients, for me FeedDemon
does the job just wonderfully. When it comes to email, I have Outlook (now
12) and the buck stops there.

NGs though I have ThunderBird, Opera, and Outlook Express. All of them are
cluttered and ugly - with the exception of Outlook Express 7 (the Vista one)
which I have yet to seriously sit down and use. Isn't KNode for Linux? I
love Linux, but I'm largely a desktop software author/publisher, and
unfortunately, Windows is where the money is.

Yep. If you're using an RSS client from the 60s (err, y2k), it'll
dynamically support it.
Same with Atom 0.3. Atom 1.0 is amazing and, IMO, the very best feed type
out there - but's just getting supported.

Errr, wroooooooong.

RSS 0.9x is the older (and still prevalent, unfortunately) versions.
"RSS1" is not RSS, but RDF
RSS 2 is the current standard
And then there's Atom, which I'm thinking of learning and ditching RSS
by the wayside.

You DO mean "2.0.5", right?  Why would you apply a development version
patch to an old out-of-date version of the software and expect it to
work?

The times I've tried using it (if we are speaking of Show At Most.... on 
the Reading subpanel), I didn't like how non-intuitive it seemed to be 
(the days only count if there was a post on a day, if 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Reading_Options_SubPanel is still correct). 
If you end up keeping it, I'd rather just see the posts from the last X 
days, regardless of whether or not there were posts on some of those days.

I realize you are potentially setting up a condition where you might not 
  show ANYTHING, if the person had not posted within those X days, but I 
think it would simpler to see that and understand why it happened rather 
than how it works currently (again, assuming the Codex is still correct 
in this regard).

Or, give it an option box where you can check 'Count Empty Days' if you 
want to keep it that way. It would make more sense, I believe.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Revamping the <!--nextpage--> Pagination Function
Message-ID: <002401c70344$5e016e40$1a044ac0$@net>

Hi guys,

For those of us that use WP more as a CMS than as a blogging platform and
tend to have longer articles (read: reviews) up on WP, I've constantly been
less than happy with the pagination process.

WP's current pagination system is good for breaking up long articles into
smaller bits, but not for breaking up based on logical portions of articles.
I mean, it's not for use with a Table of Contents and post-page titles.

How hard would it be to completely redo the pagination process? I just
finished my exams and have *some* spare time and am willing to work on it.
The only problem is, I don't see how a revamped <!--nextpage--> function
would work.

The problem is that it is an immediate call without pre-planning. WP finds
the occurrences and explode()s based on them.

Would it work to add a custom field called "page headers" and have it act as
a CSV field with the names of each page?

So like:

page-headers:
Introduction,Gaming,Hardware,Cost,Benchmarks,Overclocking,Final Thoughts

and every time the explode function returns a value instead of assigning it
the text "next page" it will assign it an index of page-headers? 

Then provided that Page 1 is to be taken as an intro, it can spit out the
ToC at the bottom - or else into a scrolling i-frame at the top-right corner
of the first page.


This "new" method would cover everything mostly, but it's very clunky, so
I'm looking for suggestions. It makes too many assumptions, and it's not
intuitive. Having users enter the names of pages as CSVs isn't nice, and
having the ToC only on the front page most certainly isn't either.

The problem is that solving these can get really ugly really fast. For
instance, replacing <!--ToC--> with the table of contents would work, but
how long until new problems come up?

Anyway, just wondering if anyone would be interested in
a) using such a system - and how many
b) helping with the code a bit?


Most importantly, suggestions for making it more intuitive without adding
graphical clutter (Ajax ToC creation section?!) and stuff.

I applaud the idea.  I'll give it some thought as well...  It seems ripe
ground for a plugin...

My PageNames plugin (which, admittedly, I can't remember if I ever released 
to the public!) does a bunch of this, by allowing the page name as PART of 
the <!--nextpage--> tag, i.e., <!--nextpage:And in other news...-->, or 
something like that.  I believe page 1 defaults to some static string you 
define, but I recall looking at adding a <!--firstpage:Title--> sort of 
thing in.  There's also helper functions for getting the current page name, 
outputting a TOC list, and I seem to recall I had revised a next/prev page 
links function that can optionally print the page names (in addition to page 
number, and user-supplied next/prev strings, as normal).

If you look at any multipage review on chait.net, that's how the toc and 
per-page subtitles are done.

There's definitely arguments for going various directions.  I prefer to have 
the page title at the start of the page it is titling, rather than some 
master list up top, or some custom fields.  Having it at the start of the 
pagebreak means I know what that page is called, and I don't have to worry 
about reordering a single list somewhere if I move stuff around.

There's also a DIFFERENT 'page title' thing, which is really 
single-page-subtitles.  There are I believe multiple plugins that already 
support markup to do that.  Not that they are necessarily orthogonal 
features, but I'd prefer my in-html titles to stay in html, and things that 
are 'theme design' like subpage names I'd like to keep tied to nextpage 
markers.  Even if it's a new tag, like '<!--pagename:Title-->'.

The only other thing to look at would be wrapping a bunch of pieces together 
with a more Word-type concept of sections, heading levels, etc.  That is, an 
'outline' format.  That's what the hN html tags are for to some degree, but 
there's no good semantics associated.

I could probably go hunt down my plugin (it was part of my redesign of my 
site to take full advantage of 2.x and less core hacking), and get it posted 
up somewhere.

The simplicity is splendid, but I am reluctant to use the pagination  
function as often as one should. It begs for the inclusion some links  
that ease navigation (e.g. adding section titles or "adding back to  
page X" or "next page" hyperlinks). How often have you stumbled upon  
an article which you failed to see (at least based on a first glimpse)  
was fragmented into finer segments? A TOC is important as well. Only  
then can you discover the pertinent details (e.g. screenshots) that  
interest you the most. Pageloads and scrolling are miles away in terms  
of response/reaction time.

Employ a popup menu/sequence that generates this, just like links in

Simple JavaScript prompts don't count as "Ajax", which by the way,  
WordPress hasn't much of. The term Ajax has been contaminated since  
Jesse first coined it. Same with Web 2.0.

I actually meant something more like the widgets admin panel, where you can
add/remove/switch items. But I have *no* idea how that's done...

Commercial Interest Warning:

I have mentioned on the list before that I have a plugin in development for
publishing ebooks.

Lots of the features being discussed are similar, or could eventually become
similar to what I am putting together.

It is using pages currently, but that doesn't mean at some time it won't be
adapted to do something similar with normal posts.

My plugin won't be GPL licensed and I want to avoid any possible comments in
the future that might occure. 

It is fairly hard to avoid seeing details of your future plugin on the
mailing list, and conflicts can often arise when commercial software has
huge similarities with something that is a GPL project.

How *does* WP deal with things like this?
For me, it's just a plugin, but on the whole, how does a non-GPL component
of WP get judged?
Many of us know and trust each other - that's one thing. But in other cases,
how are these things determined? Has it happened before? I'm sure it has....

That is not a way for the core to function - just think of the number of
support forum posts - "My blog shows no posts on the front page"...

For me, if it is to stay I would like to see the change I suggested [1]
committed so that the option is explicit in it's behaviour.

I would be happy though to see it go - as long as the relavent hooks
exists to replicate it's behaviour with a simple plugin.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Question about parameters to wp() function
Message-ID: <DB39F880-485E-4706-B2CA-71F71B752AFE@codehooligans.com>

This past summer I hacked into edit-pages.php and admin-functions.php  
(the page_rows() function), WP version 2.0.2 and 2.0.4. The site had  
more then 3000 total pages that were defined into 8 nested levels.  
The default loading of the edit pages window took something like 3-5  
minutes depending on server load.

So I made some code changes to display Tier I (post_parent=0) items  
first. If any of these items contains sub-items I would make the  
post_title display as a link and pass that page ID as the parent. So  
when the page reloads I pulled the parent page id from the _GET vars  
and display the tier items whose parent is the previous page posts.  
I'm sure you get the idea. I couldn't figure out a way to do this via  
a plugin so a hacking I went.

Finally my question:
Now I'm playing with the latest SVN trunk, WP version 2.1alpha3. I  
see some major changes in edit-pages.php and admin-functions.php. I  
just trying to see if my hack functionality will still work. In my  
original implementation I wrote some custom queries to pull in the  
values I needed. Now in the SVN version I'd like to use as much of  
the 'infrastructure' code that is provided. One function I'm trying  
to track down is wp(). This is called at the top of edit-pages.php to  
load the items for display. I've traced this into query.php to the  
function get_posts(). What I'm scratching my head about is how can I  
pass a parameter to filter the parent or child_of? Something like the  
get_pages() parameter 'child_of'.

Any thoughts?

Paul

So cause you are working on a commercial plugin you don't want someone
else will talk or write a plugin that do something similar but it's
full GPL?

The solution is you unsubscribe this list so you won't risk to read
something "wrong" :)

There is a saying "walls have ears", this list is open and often is the only
source of information on specific searches regarding Wordpress development.

Lots of people on the list are paid consultants who earn a living developing
Wordpress sites, and the plugins they release are often based upon a
solution they use for their clients.

I am not a programmer - I come up with ideas of what I want to do with
Wordpress, and pay a team of programmers to develop the ideas for me.

My own usage of the plugins will not cover the development costs. 300 hours
of programming (for one plugin) at outsourcing rates still adds up.

Some of what my programmers will be producing will be released free of
charge. It might still not be GPL, because if I release something as GPL, I
might not be able to use the same code in a non GPL product.

I am an ethical guy, saw mention of something that was similar to what I am
working on, and thought it best to mention it, to prevent any problems in
the future.

I am not saying I will be copying ideas. I was past the conceptual stage
with my programmers months ago.

2 Weeks ago I actually froze the project, because I saw a need for another
plugin, and that plugin will be provided for free, though probably not GPL
because of the code sharing problem.

Hopefully that relatively simple plugin will be finished on Friday, and my
programmers can go back to work on my other projects.

I don't think leaving the list is the solution. If everyone who earn money
in some way from Wordpress left the list it would be pretty empty or not
exist.

I believe it was the ethical thing to do to disclose my interests in a
similar project.

If someone wants to contribute the cost of the lawyer to my development fund
sure. Even then I doubt the opinion could be based around test cases and
offer any level of security.

The GPL has a special version for programs such as libraries that allow them
to be used in the development of commercial products.

What I am effectively doing is creating commerical function libraries, and
then using them from a plugin. The plugin interface might be regarded by
many as being GPL depending on how it uses other Wordpress functions, but
the libraries are not.

That being said, I have also made sure my programmers don't use other GPL
plugins as source for the interface elements. 

My license is written in such a way that if  during 3rd party code review it
is determined that a certain file, due to the way it interacts with
Wordpress makes it GPL, then the specific license reverts to GPL for that
one file.

What I was referring to was an owner's rights to copyright license and
additionally license their own work as they desire. That is what makes
your statement "if I release something as GPL, I might not be able to
use the same code in a non GPL product" absurd.

I have had the (unfortunate) experience of working with lawyers and
area experts on complex (GPL) licensing related to Firefox and Flock.

The details you provide are in response are different matters, and
outside of my interest. I would recommend consulting a lawyers about
your "license [being] written in such a way that if..." because
copyright is not defined by file but by the work -- which may be
equivalent or not.

Enough of this for me, it gives me headaches, and when it comes to
legal matters the less I know often the better off I am,

Ah, a very concise way to isolate the code.  Well done.

And I applaud your notification of the list.  It probably would not ever be
needed, but it is good to keep stuff upfront and out in the open.

You concern with strictly adhering to licensing issues is not universal and
is thus quite commendable.

It is not in the interests of the FSF to untangle legal uncertainties, of
which I understand there to be a vast number.

Here is an interesting concept. (IANAL)

One of the best ways to license your own products developed in a black box
might be to also introduce uncertainties. 

Having a very strict clearly worded license could give more room for
creative interpretation.

Yes I will be consulting my lawyer

You would need to add a child_of query arg using the relavent api and then
add a where clause to the query using the releavent filter.

The following plugin I wrote to allow child_of query's within page
templates  provides this functionality :

Message-ID: <674b4a3b0611090150i260d7c94u65a9a1b04c4646aa@mail.gmail.com>

According to the current minimum requirements page[1] WordPress
requires only MySQL 3.23.23, but trunk revision 4455 introduced the
use of SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS, which is available only in MySQL 4.0+

Was this move deliberate?  If so, what is the new minimum MySQL
version going to be for 2.1?

+1 to your solution. But I would still like to see the option to show 
true days, perhaps though not as the default. I know, send code.  :)

now if I remember correctly.

Message-ID: <209657AB-9F75-4CDF-908F-649F514221D4@anschitech.de>

Hi,

I want to use Wordpress as a cms for a website.
There will be posts and pages.
On one page I want to embedd a form where one can choose what will be  
shown on this page.
As a stand alone page on an other website this works just fine.
Embedded in Wordpress the initial page with the radio buttons and the  
select field will be shown correctly.
My problem is, that after pressing the submit button, the parameters  
appended to the url will not be recognized by the form. So the chosen  
data will not be displayed, just the initial page.
Additionally the layout is broken by this included page.

Here's the page: http://elektroink.de/transistoren/

Any hints how I can get this to work correctly?

Best Regards,
   Andr? Schieleit

PS: Here's the code of my page.php:

<?php get_header(); ?>
<div id="content" class="narrowcolumn">

     <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
	<div class="post" id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
		<h2><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
         <?php
             /*
             * if there is a directory "pages" in the home path of  
wordpress,
             * then look if there is a file with the name of the  
requested
             * page and include it to this page.
             * this makes it possible to have a custom tailored page  
wich includes
             * php-code to have displayed within an existing wordpress
             */
         ?>
         <?php $page_include=ABSPATH."/pages/".get_the_title 
().".php"; ?>
         <?php if (file_exists($page_include)) :
                 include($page_include);
             endif;?>
		<div class="entrytext">
                 <?php the_content('<p class="serif">
                                         Lesen Sie den ganzen Beitrag  
&raquo;
                                    </p>'); ?>

                 <?php link_pages('<p><strong>Seiten:</strong> ', '</ 
p>', 'number'); ?>
		</div>
	</div>
       <?php endwhile; endif; ?>
     <?php edit_post_link('Diesen Beitrag bearbeiten.', '<p>', '</

<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>

Message-ID: <43d6a44c0611101742t4a9e40ecpa4da4bd7bcf553a0@mail.gmail.com>

Instead of trying to clean up the current codex, I think the best of the old
codex should be taken and put into a new codex with a better search type
feature. I know the whole point of a wiki is for it to be edited by
everyone, but the codex got this way because if someone can't find something
right away, they'll just add it. While this good most of the time, if it
actually in the codex somewhere, it just adds bloat. Maybe there could be a
policy instituted like Wikipedia has that some articles are locked down for
new users or someone would have to request a change to an important page.

If no one is that ambitious, I think at the very least there should be
keywords added to the most important pages so that people who have a general
idea on what to search for, can get their answer with a search that is
relevant to they're looking for. That is, instead of clogging up the mailing
lists or the support forums.

Questions, Comments, Flames?

I know that exists, but I bet a lot less questions would be asked if the
codex was more searchable.

I'll have to agree with this, there's already *enough* discussions going in the hackers list.. no need to bring the Codex discussions here too! 

+1 For keeping the Codex discussions on the wp-docs list! It was made for a reason peoples, lets use it! ;) =)

I agree with you.

A lot of people seemed to have missed, or simply dismissed this thread. 
I think you have a very valid point: Subscription to comments for email 
delivery without email confirmation is annoying, can be dangerous, and 
is at risk of being a legal liability (spam laws, etc).

However, as there is no "subscribe to comments" feature in the core, you 
may not be talking to the right people. I would find the best 
subscription plugin and write the author. If you can come up with a 
patch to include confirmation emails for subscription, I have no doubt 
the s/he would want to use it.

This was attempted at the start of the Codex project. It was determined by
some that such policies are counter to the open source ideology. Chaos
ensued and we have today, a set of documentation that is a quagmire.

I'm in the whole the-core-should-be-as-light-as-reasonably-possible boat.
Things like this are best added via plugin(s) IMO. No sense in bloating the
rest of us down that'd never use this feature.

Hi,

I  will  probably get told off for suggesting Y when X  goes
wrong, but have you already considered the pros and cons of:

     1. iframe - may lead to indexing issues, not support many Web browsers,
        become a maintenance chore and so forth.

     2. static page - an admittedly-fragment element, may not retain sidebars,
        footers etc. that are up to date.

     3. modifying the code of the form to accommodate the spurious input that
        is received as this WordPress-as-a-CMS 'side effect'

The  other  possibility would quite evidently be  to  modify
WordPress, but software updates become an issue, even if you
'pluginise' the changes and strap them onto a hook.

Hope it helps,

Roy

Scott  (skippy)? Or is it David (smallmouse)? Either way,  I
find  the Codex rather useful, though I only ever view it at
the   shallow   levels.  Wikis  could  use   a   patchmaster
equivalent---someone  who  is  familiar with the  Codex  and
prevents  duplication.  That  middleman can then  become  an
authority with editorial control though, which is dangerous.

Best wishes,

Roy

No it wasn't. The above are both great guys but the names aren't
important now.
The point was that even back then a sense of order and discipline was
needed but the free-for-all has lead to what we have now. It may all be
in there but it's hard to find.

That's why there should be keyword tagging of all the major pages. Then
maybe a system like digg has if you try to edit something and if it exists,
it can ask you if it already has it there.

You're  right.  It just saddens me when people whom  I  once
spoke to suddenly disappear. Yes, I know that they blog, but
it's  not quite the same. I hope that WP.org/Automattic  can
keep  its  community together. Take Craig for example.  He's
been  around  for  so long, even after he had  declared  his
departure (twice!).

My  personal observation is that forums don't always address
questions  directly, concisely, fully or even  successfully.
Your  search plugin for Firefox is helpful, I might as  well
add.  As for the Codex, well... that should/could have  been
the  golden reference (Holy Grail?), but experience suggests
that  no  documentation  is perfect. Help  files  and  their
indices  in  proprietary software are often  saturated  with
promotional      language      whilst       user-contributed
information/knowledge  can become political, grossly  reused
and---in  worst  of circumstance---even mirrored or  grafted
from  someone's  existing peer-reviewed text (sometimes  for
shameless self promotion of some hypothesis).

I happen to be part of a project (NewAssignment) which leads
the way to so-called 'Open Source journalism'. These are all
questions  that  we are yet to address and investigate.  How
does  one generate answers and reviews that best reflect  on
the  truth  (subjective in its own right)? Can an editor  be
trusted?  Can  you assign a group to cover a  story  without
repeated  rebuttals and fight over content and structure? Is
balance  deserved under all circumstances? How can something
like  a  WordPress Wiki be handled in a democratic  way  (no
entry  barriers)  and  still  maintain  and  attain   better
quality? It's quite a conundrum.

Best wishes,

Roy

I found a solution to get the data generated by the form. It is  
indeed just a simple foreach() loop:

foreach($_POST as $key=>$element)
{
     ${$key}=$element;
}

Almost :).
$_POST[element] would do the trick, thanks for this hint.
But that would mean to change all occurrences of all $variables in  
the file. So the variables keep their names and I have just three  
lines additional code.

I do this loop too, in some places. I think it's important to remember
that "register globals" defaults to "off" now for a reason; Now I
incorporate a case statement within the loop like:
for ( $_POST as $key=>$val ){
	switch ($key ){
		case "mine":
		case "mine":
		case "mine":
			${$key}=cleanup($val);
		break;
		default;	
	}
}
Where function "cleanup" is a function to clean user input.

Robin's suggestion is excellent, you really should reference posted form 
fields using the $_POST['elementname'] syntax.

Going through the entire $_POST array and re-registering global 
variables that have just been explicitly unset is a very bad idea. 
That's effectively undoing everything that `register_globals off'[1] and 
wp_unregister_GLOBALS()[2] do(for POST variables).


As an aside, while checking this over I noticed that requests like 
/blog/index.php?GLOBALS=Injected are supposed to be wp_die()'d with 
'GLOBALS overwrite detected' on line 8 of wp-settings.php, but wp_die() 
isn't included until later in the same file. Opened trac ticket #3357[3]

1: http://www.php.net/register_globals
2: http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-settings.php#L3

jquery is, imo, the best js library I've used -- and that color picker

That code is in load_template().

"file" is not a default query var so it should never be in 
$wp_query->query_vars unless a plugin adds it.  We can use a different 
variable name in load_template() for extra safety, I suppose. 
$template_file instead of $file.

I cannot reproduce.

It's been sent to security. Probably not a good idea to hit the list  
with one of these as it's public and may cause an unnecessary stir.

Yeah, I can't see any way to exploit anything here unless a plugin or
theme is injecting a 'file' value into wp_query. Should we consider
setting an extract type and/or prefix, just to lessen the possibility
that a plugin or theme could dirty the variable space?

This is a friendly plug for a new wordpress plugin called 30 Boxes  
Buddy Cards.

It is a simple way to build community with avatars and additional  
profile information for those who comment on your blog.  It also  
provides an optional verification system for commenters as well as  
comment tracking for people across blogs.

Andy Skelton posted about it recently here

Never made a decision here.  Using Links or Bookmarks seemed to be the

We still have the combined category list with no way of filtering at the

Still some gotchas lingering, it seems.

See separate thread on this issue.  Need to handle race conditions.

Looking better.  Still a couple of bugs to fix.

This is pretty complete now.  I think we need to deprecate the older 
link API and make it use wp_list_bookmarks().

masquerade, do you still have those patches floating around?  Currently 
export is not a complete replacement for backup since it doesn't 
preserve post IDs.

I think we decided not to bundle anything.

Would like to get this in.

I never understood - why can't we just make that text dynamically changeable
in the default links widget?

Uhm, we're talking about admin menus for one, and for two, widgets is
neither core nor bundled.

The URL provided in the example is not a valid exploit. IT DOES NOT
WORK. (Repeating for those that didn't get it already. Sorry.)

Setting an extract type would be good.

In case somebody missed it, this is not a security hole. The original
reporter was wrong.

Doesn't this answer the question? If the API is now 'bookmarks' then  
surely so should all other references - like the admin menu and admin  
pages.

I suggest that names assigned to functions in the API should not
determine how the outcome of that code is labelled in the user
interface. Does the name of the function 'is_home()' dictate that the
page with the posts on it must always be the front or 'home' page of a
WordPress site?

'Links' is the broadest, most generic description of this functionality.
'Blogroll' and 'Bookmarks' have connotations that will suggest  that the
functionality is more restricted or specialized than it actually is. A
change from 'Links' in 2.0 to 'Blogroll' or 'Bookmarks' in 2.1 will
suggest that the functionality has become more restricted or
specialized, to the exclusion of other uses to which it might be put,
whereas the opposite is the case. 'Blogroll' or 'Bookmarks' can be used
for categories of links, emphasizing how the functionality has been
enhanced.

Oh I totally agree with you and by that token there was nothing wrong  
with the nomenclature of the old 'links' template tags. Template tags  
are used by a large number of people and are confusing to beginners  
as it is. My argument was simply that if you refer to the  
functionality as 'Blogroll'; name the corresponding API 'Bookmarks';  
and both of these  replace what all current users know as 'Links'  
then you have created instant confusion.

This debate has been going on for months! Personally I promote  
'Links' and I'd much prefer the current set of 'Links' template tags  
to continue to service the 'Links', regardless of the underlying  
changes in the categories structure. Why would I want, or be expected  
to change my templates for an upgrade that actually offers me nothing  
new?

Another thought, regarding links/blogroll, occurred to me yesterday.  With
the increasing use and promotion of WP use as CMS solution, language
specific to blogging should probably be minimized.  Making WP Blog centric
will perpetuate the idea that using WP as a CMS is bending it in ways it was
not meant to be bent.

I am slowly familiarizing myself with the 2.1 code with a view to
adapting it to my needs.

I would be grateful to know whether there a particular reason why
WordPress does not use php sessions to kept track of the information
about logged in admins and users that it retrieves and calculates each
time the user requests a page? 

Is there something about the code in the admin section that would be
inimical to the use of sessions in added custom admin pages to keep
track of additional information that is used in storing and retrieving
information from another database on the same server?

I think it is a philosophical preference, not a technical constraint.
If you would like to make a plugin for sessions in WordPress, I'd be
interested in seeing what if any core changes are necessary to make it
possible. It might be very useful to have that flexibility in core.

What uses do you have for this?

We're currently preparing to convert our blog to WordPress and

We use an HTTP accelerator, and this sort of screws with the caching.
Is there a reason for this?  I notice that in wp-includes/classes.php
(line 1629) there's a comment wrt only emitting them for feeds.  Can
anyone provide some context on why WP has this behavior?

Thanks,

WP does not have this facility for HTML pages because there are too
many ways for the page to change with each page load, e.g. user
cookies or random bookmark selection or fuzzy time/date displays like
"5 minutes ago."

A plugin could be written to emit that header and only update it when
the database is altered, but it would not be strictly correct for most
themes.

Well FWIW, the software isn't really being developed as a CMS, rather some
adventurous folks are hammering together plugins and hacks and such to make
WP work as a CMS. It's promoted as a personal publishing system, not as a
CMS. The majority of users will be bloggers, so why confuse them for the
sake of highly technical people who wish to create a CMS from a blogging
tool?

The quick answer would be: Plugins and themes.

In a general release, there are way to many ways for any particular WP page
to change.

Plugins, user settings and theme switchers all work against WP delivering a
standard page. 

However, WP DOES use Last-Modified for all feeds.  There even two detection
methods, for the last modified date, based upon whether or not the feed
includes comments. 

If you take a look at the function Send_Headers with in
wp-includes/classes.php, you'll see the support for Last-Modified.

If your page is really static, (and looking at your blog it is) you can
easily fix the problem by MOVING (not copying) this code:
       // We're showing a feed, so WP is indeed the only thing that last
changed
       if ( $this->query_vars['withcomments'] )
           $wp_last_modified = mysql2date('D, d M Y H:i:s',
get_lastcommentmodified('GMT'), 0).' GMT';
       else
           $wp_last_modified = mysql2date('D, d M Y H:i:s',
get_lastpostmodified('GMT'), 0).' GMT';
       $wp_etag = '"' . md5($wp_last_modified) . '"';
       @header("Last-Modified: $wp_last_modified");
       @header("ETag: $wp_etag");

up right after the first line:
@header('X-Pingback: '. get_bloginfo('pingback_url'));

Another question might be, why don't we have a hook right there in
send_header.  It would be a good place for one.  Is there an equivelent hook
somewhere else?

Why is WP suppressing those header functions? If there are errors, no one is
gonna know and unsent headers might be a problem.

I think I heard some things about WP being developed to more of an "open"
CMS -- blogging tool for average Joe users, and powerful CMS for those
advanced people.

Because sometimes extra lines/whitespace sneak in there either from a bad
text editor or in the progress of uploading, and it's no good to have a
pageful of errors. Maybe switch this to something more flexible -- control
it with error_reporting() rather than suppressing it completely?

I belive it *is* something of a tweek, albeit a good one, to recraft 
WordPress into a CMS tool.

As for the naming of links, I guess someone "up there" :) has to decide 
dictator wise,  what it should be.
This debate only repeating itself since long, so let me repeat the best 
suggestion in my opinion.
Links are links so let's call them just that.
Links have categories, so introduce one default category called "Blogroll".
The rational for this wouldn't be all that hard to explain to new 
WordPress'ers.

Just my, you know ..

By this time next year, I doubt that statement will be true; not with the

Thanks Mark.  I was thinking "Shuttle" was a proposed theme the
screenshots of which appeared about six months ago, but now I gather
it's a gradual, long-term project.

Message-ID: <3d3003250611170135y5daed2f2h2c297eb735b56ddd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm a bit new to the list, so apologies if this stuff is covered elsewhere,
though I did try a search or two. I have two issues that I wouldn't mind
hearing thoughts on, both apply at least to wordpress 2.0.5 .

1) I encountered a weird issue on my blog that turned out to be due to echo
choking when passed more than a certain amount of data. The file in question
was the optimised version of TinyMCE that gets echoed in
wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_gzip.php. I worked around this with
something similar to the echobig function mentioned in the comments in
http://php.net/echo, and when I noticed that I saw there were claims this
kind of splitting of big echos actually improved speed.

While I suspect whatever buffer my host has set too low is usually not  a
problem, I wonder if it's worth using something like echobig to echo out the
particularly large files, like tinymce, and generally making it available?

2) For no particularly good reason I wanted a certain category of my blog to
appear under a different theme, but I noticed that theme choosing is done
before the post detail is populated. I was wondering if there is a technical
reason this couldn't be moved to after the db querying, so that some of the
post information would be available to theme choosing plugins without having
to duplicate work?

Thanks!

If you only want to theme a certain category differently then you can
probably using the 'template_redirect' hook [1][2] to change the theme if
that category is selected.

I looked at the redirect hook, but it means the template constant has
already been set, and you have to handle the different case in the plugin.
Obviously that's all doable, but if you can filter the template name it just
involves changing the one variable (well, two for the stylesheet) and then
rest is handled. I suppose that in the majority of cases there's only going
to be a couple of pages requiring it and you can fall through to the regular
handling for the rest.

Thanks westi,

Message-ID: <4681c7d40611170903v607089d7vb39b3eacac625cd@mail.gmail.com>

Not to spam or anything, but with the recent discussions (mostly
started by me....) about request_uri and general IIS compatibility
with WordPress plugins and features, I've finally figured it out.

Basically, no matter what you do or where you look, IIS doesn't
understand the concept of URI rewrites, so no matter what happens,
it'll give you a physical path, and not the actual entry.

This method uses an ISAPI filter on top of the IIS engine to intercept
calls, note the original URI, then pass it along to the server
variable.

http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/291

I took it for a test run with the most request_uri intensive plugin I
could find, Scott Yang's Permalink Redirect plugin, and it works a
dream. :-D

Once you set up your server with the files at the link, you don't have
to modify scripts to make request_uri work, it becomes as if you're on
Apache or another request_uri compatible serevr in every aspect and
can be used as such.

Please let me know what you guys think or if you have any suggestions
or ideas or complaints....

Message-ID: <455E2D89.5020906@valan.net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

Recently I migrated from Blogger to Wordpress 2.0.5. During
customisation of my templates I noticed that the wp_list_cats() function
doesn't support $before and $after parameters as other listing template
functions do - e.g. get_archives() or get_links().

I need a $before parameter because certain browsers still have poor
support for the CSS :before directive.

I implemented a tiny hack in template-functions-category.php which
solved my problem (thank God Worpress is open source :) Still, I find
the addition of $before and $after parameters a useful and consistent
feature and would like to suggest it for future inclusion in the
official code.

Wish you a nice weekend,

Vladimir

Message-ID: <200611180101.14478.r.haeder@will-hier-weg.de>

Hello,

As you may know number_format() returns a well-formed number like 1,234.56.

The comma is for thousand separators and the dot is the decimal dot.

But in some countries like Germany it's vise-versa.

So maybe there can be added a "hook" like "number_format" to the core which 
does deal with it?

Or how may be we make this easy for customers to solve?

Well, many know that the decimal dot comes from the computer but some may not 
know it and will be confused about this. :-/

Any ideas?

If you want the same functionality without having to hack the source,
you can use regular expressions to post-process the output functions
wp_list_cats. It's ugly as heck, but I have a couple spots in my
template where I use output-buffer functions to scoop up the output,
and crunch it.

If you'd like more details about this, send me an off-list message and
I'll dig up a little example code for you.

Mike

File handling abstraction so that things like mogilefs can be plugged in 
  is on the menu.  And maybe we can start playing with the admin UI.

But let's not get too distracted from 2.1.  We need to get it out the door.

It's pretty bad form to use unregistered media types, and at the very
least it ought to be in the `prs` (personal) or `vnd` (vendor)
trees.[1][2] Also, it seems to me that it's a better fit for
"application"[3] than "text"[4].

Something like `application/prs.wordpress.export+xml`?

There are examples of what others are using at IANA.[5]

Can be done... but with more than 300 tickets open for 2.1 there is
time and resources for new stuff for furture versione to play with?

Putting 2.1 on branch will make world waiting for 2.1 be realesed in a
month or so.. is this the planned timeline?

Let the world wait =P

We just make it clear that 2.1 was branched for technical reasons and
has nothing to do with a timeline of any sorts.

Branching and finishing 2.1 sounds like a good idea.

We do need to target a release soon.

We may not have enough time left for a pre-christmas release - afterall
we don't want a christmas release like last time ;-)

Maybe we should aim for a date mid Janurary?

You should be able to... did you sign up for a support forum user/password (
wordpress.org/support) then login with that at trac.wordpress.org?

I can use my account to create a ticket as far as I can see.

That header was used because it worked, not because I know anything  
about media types :)

I suggest reopening the ticket to offer advice both here and there.

Hi Robin,

Yes, I did register. Trac refused to create a ticket of type
"enhancement", but today I circumvented this successfully: I created a
"defect" ticket and then changed it to "enhancement" :)

It appears the Trac system is somewhat inconsistent when applying the
privilege rules :) A bug maybe?

My voice won't count much, but it's probably better to make it  
progress-driven (e.g. testing/feedback, number of bugs pending) rather  
than deadline-driven. Promises lead to pressure and disappointment,  
which in turn leads to poor(er) and sloppy(ier) code. I can vividly  
remember last year (2.0). Matt decided to release within a few days of  
notice and the outcome wasn't too pleasant. I was in the forums over  
Christmas and there were many different bugs in the code. It wasn't  
truly ready for 'prime time' and its quality was in par with a beta  
rather than an RC or 'stable'. The frustrating experience left me to  
ditching the forums (among other factors).

Best wishes,

Roy

Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAEqGUqqnndIRmPUAIHgTPH5ChAAAEAAAAOIrFNzNxMxOhn+DXdm7vSUBAAAAAA==@rogers.com>

I just downloaded the latest nightly and got bitten by this change. I'm
running MySQL 3.23.58 on my local test server because that's what's
running on the virtual server I use. Some hosting providers are pretty
conservative about changing these things -- I gather things break when
MySQL is upgraded from 3.23.xx to 4.x+. I'm not going to move everything
off that server to one with MySQL 4.0 and PHP 5.0 just to contend with
this issue.

I hope the MySQL 4.0+ functionality is really needed for what you want
to do, because I suspect there will be others in your user base who will
be in the same position I am now in when 2.1 is released.  I suppose you
will tell those folks that they are SOL, that they can continue using
2.0 or just find a new host. I suppose they may ask whether you will
continue to support 2.0 at least to the extent of backporting security
fixes. You will want to have a plan for dealing with this issue before
releasing 2.1.

Meanwhile, I guess I can't follow along any more, at least for now. 

Best wishes,

Owen V. Gray

Wow....

@Craig: I'm afraid you're a bit wrong there, it's not a auto-reply.
It's a stupid pre-generated message. The difference is, this is more
blatantly annoying. One of them comes out as a REPLY when an email is
received. The second is actively sent out to all members on your
contacts list - this is the latter.

MailMan, the mailing list software, can and is very good at filtering
out properly formatted and RPC-compliant auto-responders. For a while
when I was moving, I had an auto-responder on my email that would send
a message like this as a response to the first email I received from
each email address every 3 weeks until turned off. Of course, I didn't
unsubsribe from WP-Hackers during that time, but neverthless my "spam"
didn't reach the list because I properly formatted the auto-replies.

But this - it's just so damn annoying. He *picked* to send it to us!!!

The 4.0+ functionality sure is handy. We can either live without it, 
include some compatibility code that uses the new way for MySQL >=4.0 
and another way for <4.0, or provide a "crufty-old-platform.php" plugin 
that allows WP to run on ancient setups.  A plugin might be nice as it 
allows use to move certain things forward for the bulk of the user base 
to enjoy without baggaging them with legacy platform support.

We've committed to supporting 2.0 for several years.  This change won't 
be going into 2.0, at least not any time soon and not until well after 
2.1 is out.

I+1 setting now a date in january as proposal release date would be
helpfull to plugin developpers to start think to check an test theyr
plugin and have plenty of time to update thayr stuff... this would be
a nice first step towards the 4/6 months realease cycle Matt proposed
some time ago.

And no... a Xmas eve release wouldn't be good for translation team too

If we're going to increase the minimum version, could we make it at
least 4.1?  4.1 introduced subqueries, which I've needed to use on
more than one occasion.

I gather there is handy functionality in PHP5 too.

If you are in any doubt about whether to include a plugin to ensure that
those still using MySQL 3.23.xx can upgrade to 2.1, you could post a
message in the dev blog at wordpress.org expressing that doubt, and see
what reaction you get in the forums and elsewhere.

Just a point of information, 1and1.com, "The worlds #1 web host" in
number of sites hosted, runs 4.0.25.

But maybe, just maybe, since their blogging platform provided by their
control panel is Wordpress based, upping the requirement to 4.1 would
push them and others to upgrade.  It's a risk.

Frankly, I wish they'd just upgrade to 5 so I could get stored
procedures.

We've always been very conservative in bumping dependencies. We support 
some truly ancient versions of PHP and MySQL, much to the chagrin of the 
PHP and MySQL teams.  However, 3.23 isn't even supported anymore, and 
MySQL stopped hosting binaries for it.  Perhaps it's time to move on.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Rewrite URIs Hack
Message-ID: <C18733EF.579%leahy@au.org>

First off, I have used WordPress for a while now but I am fairly new to the
hacking of it.

I am in the process of moving a blog over to WordPress and would like to use
some custom mod_rewrites to prevent breaking old links while being able to
move to a more logic URI scheme. Since I have not found an answer for how to
get WordPress 2 to handle custom rewrites, I worked on a little hack in
wp-settings.php. 

wp-settings.php:
...
if ( ! isset($blog_id) )    $blog_id = 1; // START HACK // Fix for rewritten
URIS with mod rewrite if(!empty($_SERVER["REDIRECT_QUERY_STRING"]) &&
!empty($_SERVER["REDIRECT_URL"]) && $_SERVER["REDIRECT_URL"] ==
"/index.php"){    $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = "/index.php"; } // END HACK //
Fix for IIS, which doesn't set REQUEST_URI if ( empty(
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ) ) {
...

One thing that I know could cause issues is if WordPress is installed in a
different directory other than the root.  In addition, from my test
REDIRCT_QUERY_STRING is reflected in QUERY_STRING; but will this always be
the case?

Message-ID: <4561F328.50108@obuweb.com>

I'm running wordpress from trunk, updated this morning

I have a plug-in that is adding 3 new pages as submenu items to the profile

Menu wise im doing:
add_submenu_page('profile.php','item1','Item 
1','custom_role',__FILE__,'method1');
add_submenu_page('profile.php','item2','Item 
2','custom_role',__FILE__,'method2');
add_submenu_page('profile.php','item3','Item 
3','custom_role',__FILE__,'method3');

The menu items are added successfully and the methods are called but all 
3 pages are shown selected when any one of them is selected.
Am I doing something wrong with the menu additions or is this just a bug.

I see one possible workaround of making  a plugin per page but thats a 
bit of a pain.

Our API is lame and confusing. :-)  Since you are using method 
callbacks, try replacing __FILE__ with any arbitrary string.  Make each 
one unique.

I have to agree with Roy.

Didn't we discuss this back in the "120 day release cycle" thread? It
was decided that WP as a community works best to release-when-ready
and that's the way things work out...

WP 2.1 is huge. Let's not mess it up.

My re-reading of the thread in question [1] gives the opposite
impression -- most people seemed excited by the prospect of a fixed
cycle.

I don't see why not. If it doesn't look like it's working, it's the
easiest thing in the world to revert to "release when ready". Just
miss the deadline and you're there.

Message-ID: <bf80421c0611210001y6648cf27t273e613399f2519c@mail.gmail.com>

After upgrading to 2.0.5 from 2.0.4, I am unable to add categories from the
post page. It comes up with the error: "You don't have permission to do
that." I double checked, and I am set as an administrator. I can add them
just fine from the category section of the manage part of the admin. I
assumed it was because of my theme or plugins so I disabled those and still
have the error. I then decided that it could be my installation, so I
installed 2.0.5 fresh in a different location, and it still returns the
error. I am wondering what would cause this problem from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5 and
how can I fix it? On the support forums, all the similar issues are with
version 2.0.3, and those were fixed in 2.0.4. This place was my last resort
to resolve my problem.

Thanks for help in advance,

Can you explain where the trouble is?

I want to have more than one set of permalinks rules. As far as I can figure
out, you can only have one set of permalinks rules with the provided option.
Since I wish to change the permalinks rules and at the same time not break
links to the older posts, I need two sets of permalinks rules.

What they were:
/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%.html

What they will be:
/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/

I still want what they were to keep working.

A quick search of the codex gives:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Adding_Administration_Panels
http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Carthik/Plunge_into_Plugins#User_Interfaces

Should we change the documentation on the Adding_Administration_Menus page
to rename the 'file' argument:

"The file that handles the display of the menu page content or a unique
identifier for a submenu of a custom top-level menu."

Maybe just:

"A unique identifier for a submenu of a custom top-level menu."

Is there a valid need for a filename in that argument?

http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus says that
argument should be
"The file that handles the display of the menu page content or a
unique identifier for a submenu of a custom top-level menu."

Changing the parameter name from file to unique identifier would make 
things a lot more clear

You're looking at it wrong.

You don't want two sets, you want one set, and to redirect your other
old permalinks to the new ones.

http://www.freakitude.com/2006/11/04/permalinks-migration-plugin-for-wordpress/
http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/redirect-old-slugs/

You don't need to touch the WP code. I guess from this point on this
becomes a wp-support thread and should go in the forums.

The Debian Project and Fedora miss deadlines quite frequently,
for precisely these reasons. Even Ubuntu has joined the club
(belated  6.06  and  a premature release  of  6.10).  What's
probably  more important is a long /support/ cycle, e.g. the
36-month support for inclusion in Debian stable repositories
(separate old thread).

Congrats  to  Automattic,  by the way. Earlier  I  saw  some
graphs  which indicate that WordPress.com is due to overtake
TypePad. So quickly! 100,000 new blogs a day, some day...
Best wishes,

Roy

I would still really like to see this happen. Although the discussion
seems to disagree on what is the best widgets implementation, it
seemed fairly consistent on bundling widgets. I think it is an
important foundation for the experience.

Yeah, but then the argument: which widgets plugin? Automattic's or the one
that spawned from K2?

 From what I remember, there were aspects of each widget system that  
needed to be merged to make the ideal system.  How about a 2.2  
milestone on this?  4 month development cycle, so that's not too long  
to wait.

Which would be nice for theme developers who haven't made their themes
widget ready, as once this goes in as a bundle, will be expected of all
themes.

Maybe put widget support in the included themes, but lets hold off on 
bundling a widget plugin for now.

+1 Bundling *some* widgets with default themes will prompt new users to 
get on speaking terms with the concept.

It seems to be working ok, I'm not sure if it's the greatest or whatever.. but, seems to be looking like it did before, in the 2.0.? versions..  =/  However, I kind of notice the FEED Titles come after the "content".. rather then before it.. 

Example:

"Biggest Community Wins Matt"

Where it's supposed to be:

"Matt: Biggest Community Wins"

Well, atleast the HUGE fonts are changed back to normal lol.. =P  Any thoughts, suggestions, and what not?

Well, in the latest trunk SVN Matt had reverted many of the huge fonts
back to normal size.
On my install now the plugin screen has normal sized code at least,
and the names of tabs and pages are somewhere in the middle - and i
didn't touch the code.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hiding upload section
Message-ID: <24968C53-6AA8-4BBB-A8F0-3B9D2B8BEDAC@codehooligans.com>

Greeting all.

So I'm working on a plugin and just had a thought. Not related to my  
development but wondering if anyone is aware of a way to hide or  
minimize the file upload iframe section? Ideally I'm looking for  
something like the Custom Fields section that can be collapsed so it  
does not take up so much space. Of course there might be something  
with iFrames I'm not aware of that does not allow this.

Regards,
Paul

I have the following in a plugin for this:

function ak_hide_upload() {
	print('<style type="text/css"> #uploading { display: none; } </ 
style>');
}
add_action('admin_head', 'ak_hide_upload');

I never use the upload feature, so I have no need for a way of  
showing it again.

Cheers,

Among other things, the upload section can be hidden, and what is nice, is
it's by user, not globally.

Hope that helps.

And to keep things standardized, this *should* be a support forums thread,
not hackers...

not saying, just saying....

Message-ID: <122d4b4d0611241713va104552w99671f33d829864a@mail.gmail.com>

I'm cross posting this to both the forums and the hackers list, and perhaps
the copious amounts of sun from fishing all day, or perhaps it's the many
blog posts I've read lately about the lack of focused participation in the
forums/codex, but it seems after my most recent reply in the hackers list,
that if less time was spent by the more talented coders who know the code on
the hackers list, and more in the forums, either via an "advanced" forum, or
something of the sort, many birds would be killed with fewer stones...

I see more and more discussions and questions posed on the hackers list that
really could be relevant to the forums, and would be more widely read
there.  Likewise, if those that frequent the hackers list spent just a *few
more minutes* there, some of the more technical questions that go unanswered
would get some love.  I wholly understand the desire for less "noise", and
the like minded camaraderie that is shared on the hackers list, but in the
spirit of growing the community, as well as embracing new users, be it some
times skilled coders unfamiliar with the nuances of WP, it could benefit the
greater discussion.

I'm not suggesting the wp-hackers list doesn't have it's place, but am
suggesting that perhaps some of the discussion isn't that far above the
general audience that it can't be shared with the masses.

I'd hate for wp-hackers to some day evolve into into something like
css-discuss, and the only real source for meaty WP support, with the forums
relegated to the complete newbie and sploggers.


Please don't flame me too hard, as I do have a bit of a sunburn, as well as
am still stinging from being called a "maladjusted geek"...

LOL! Same here.. I'm the "King Of Maladjusted Geeks" though, remember.. hahahaha..  Anyway.. I agree with what you're saying.. just today, I seen about 2 threads in the forums, that could have used some "database professional's" love... Well, here's one for example.. 
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/94706?replies=3

(I have NO CLUE on what is wrong with it, but.. would LOVE to know myself.. lol)

I was thinking about posting it here earlier (but was sidetracked), with a link to those threads, in hopes of getting someone with some Database knowledge to look at them.. It IS a shame though, watching numerous of threads go unanswered... because the "coder pros" aren't really around in the forums to give them love.. 

I dunno, just my thoughts..  =P

Here's my take on a few reasons why the code savvy currently avoid the
forums, and why a message like this probably won't have much of an
impact.

First off, there is the obvious, the noise ratio. If hackers are going
to be bothered to answer questions, they want a question that is going
to pose a challenge, not be a look it up in the codex type answer. The
amount of headaches that the coding community gets from seeing threads
like http://wordpress.org/support/topic/55854 makes it simply not
worth the while. Figure out a way to filter the good questions from
the questions that anyone with a brain and google can answer, and you
might start attracting more coding volunteers.

Secondly, the fact that any contributions to the forums are these days
pretty much one-time things. Let's face it, the search sucks. People
repost questions because in searching they find nothing useful, never
have, and until something drastically changes, they never will. This
is a problem with all forum software, and though I find it interesting
that we use a forum so that the history can be searched, I personally
think in its current form it is completely useless and stupid and you
might as well have a WordPress Support mailing list.

Sure, the other volunteers don't mind re-answering the same repetitive
questions day after day, but that quality is not one that is
widespread, especially in the typical programmer community.

break;

I need to give my brain a rest for the night with some sleep, and so
I'll let this thread go on for a bit while I sleep. I look forward to
everyone's responses in the morning.

As the lurker with the now "too old" version of Mysql, I can't resist
observing that it seems the example forum post was by a user with a "too
new for Wordpress" version of Mysql.

>From the MySQL 5 manual:

"If you run applications that rely on MySQL's old "forgiving" behavior,
make sure to either adapt those applications or to disable strict mode."

(Forgive manual extract's ironically not-strictly-correct English
syntax.) 

The forum poster found one of perhaps many instances where Wordpress 2+
relies on Mysql's "old forgiving behavior," in this case an insert that
does not expressly assign a value to a field that does not have a
default value (and text fields cannot have default values). 

Will devs

a) specify a maximum version (4.1-) of Mysql?
b) tell Mysql 5 users to turn off strict mode?
c) add code to detect whether Mysql is in strict mode and turn strict
mode off on per session basis?
d) rewrite queries in WP2.0 and 2.1 to eliminate reliance on "features"
of older versions of Mysql?

Too new -- who knew? Seems bugs can be found by reading posts in the
forums, which reinforces the point of the first post in this thread.

Well, for me I confess that's why I'm here. I joined WP-Hackers after
stopping providing support in the forums at Neowin and ProNetworks for
general PC help. After 2 years and around 20-thousand (repetitive &
unchallenging) posts for me, I wanted out. I found wp-hackers where we could
discuss actually mind-boggling questions once in a while and laugh at the
"how do I hack hotmail" emails without wasting my time and effort on
something I have no control over.

Maybe you're right - but then again, if everyone in the NNTP newsgroups went
out and joined the general help community on online computer support forums
teh internets would be a better place.

Well Owen, the way I see it, this is traditionally a job that's given to the
experts that *do* reside on the forums. Granted, they're better than us all
for tolerating all that noise, but it's traditionally them that either
a) File a trac ticket
b) Put a heads-up here

And things get done. To date no one has really complained that WP bugs are
going unfixed for a long time (only case I can call to mind is the stupid
cron bug - but certainly not for lack of attention), and if the system works
(more or less), and more importantly, we're comfortable with it, I
personally don't see the need for change.

We can't guarantee new versions will work until they're out, of course. 
    WP "should" work with non-bleeding-edge versions of MySQL 5.  Not 
doing so is a bug.  As for the minimum version,

http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/

For 2.1 we are discussing bumping the MySQL requirement.  Some comments 
are here:

> b) tell Mysql 5 users to turn off strict mode?

Not working with strict mode is a bug.  I see that the 
post_content_filtered fix fell out of 2.0.x somewhere along the way.  I 
put in a fix for 2.0.6.  2.1 should be okay.

Not necessary.

Done.  If there are still broken queries, please note them in trac and 
target them for the 2.0.6 milestone.

I can see where the "coders" are coming from, and yet, the forum volunteers as well. I can also see, how the challenging type questions, won't ever outweigh the unchallenging type questions..

I guess, IMHO.. what HandySolo had suggested, maybe use the "hacker" tag "system"... or, whatever..  I'm NOT suggesting that hackers follow-up on this 24-7, but maybe every so often, and throw out some useful answers. 

Once you've provided an answer, "we" volunteers can bookmark those threads, (which contain the very invaluable answers by you) for future reference purposes, and just reuse them over, and, over again.. down the road..

There really isn't too many volunteers, that know alot of the "coding" type support requests, me included.. Sadly, I think that's why *alot* of the threads just end up in the "no-replies" section... floating around, from many months ago.. Because the normal volunteers just didn't have a valid answer.. 

I don't know, but, IMHO.. I think there could possibly, maybe, be, a happy medium here, or something..? Or, maybe if the really challenging threads come up, send the forum thread through here, and wait on a hacker's response to it? 

"We" volunteers don't mind trying our hardest to find the users their answers to their questions, just sometimes "we" volunteers need someone alot more knowledgeable in the coding field.. 

Just throwing these thoughts out onto the table.. [now ,ducks under the table quickly, before having something thrown at him].. =P

Oh! There is going to be a 2.0.6!? I seen the version tag 2.0.5.1-beta1, and assumed there wasn't going to be a 2.0.6 lol. I was wondering about that the other day.. 

Oh well, I just upgraded my main blog to 2.1 alpha3 yesterday afternoon.. so, I guess I'm 10 steps ahead of the "game" lol.. =P (No problems with that either, from what I can see, knock on wood quick, though.. ) =P

spencerp

/Oh, and also installed bbpress onto the 2.1-alpha3 test blog, without a hitch.. I'm on a roll lately.. I think it has to do with all that Pepsi I'm drinking lol. ;) =)

There in lies the bloody issue.  I've yet to see anyone who volunteers in
the forums consider themselves an expert... and I've never expected a
check.

Moose, you were right, without saying it, this was a classic bang head
against wall exercise, and if "computer guru"'s  response is of at all the
general consensus of those that participate/haunt the wp-hackers list, well,
my belief in a WP community has been shaken.

I do find solace that the mysql issue that went unresolved in the forums was
addressed and will fixed.

Lesson learned, albeit a painful one.

Updated, to avoid confusion.  I changed that before 2.0.6 was settled  
on as the new version number.  Ryan wants to go 2.0.7, 2.0.8, 2.0.9,  
2.0.10, 2.0.11 etc... For some reason I was thinking  that each  
number should be 0-9, and I didn't want to "run into" 2.1, as we'll  
be supporting the 2.0 branch for years and likely releasing future  
revisions.  Anyway Ryan, I'm on board with 2.0.10, 2.0.11 etc.

Interesting post. I come from a similar 'background', having posted  
over 20,000 messages to UseNet in the past 2 years. I also tried the  
WordPress support forums, but found that people there are impatient  
and sometimes rude (at times even your 'colleagues'). In any event,  
wp-hackers is one of the only mailing lists which I find very  
professional. It encourages participation. I guess there's a divide  
between those who support software (sometimes supporting a commercial  
product without being paid) and discussing directions in development.

Best wishes,

Roy

Oh, ok.. Thank you Mark, for clarifying that. ;) =)  As of now, I have the main blog running 2.1 alpha3, as well as the 212.vindictivebastard.net sub domain. 

I have two other blogs which are really behind on their upgrades, but, will get on upgrading them to the 2.0.6-alpha-1 soon here.. Thanks again.. ;) =)

I don't like answering  the same repetitive  question, nor do  I.  For some
ungodly reason,  I have a memory that serves me much better than most, and I
know when I read a question if it's been asked before.  (Granted, I've read
probably a thousand or more threads...)  Can I be sure they'll easily find
it by a search?  No.   Have I shared my thoughts over the year plus that
I've volunteered on how to make those things easier to find?  Yes.  Has it
gotten better?  Yes.

I'm not remotely asking the "hackers" to answer the common questions about
sidebars dropping down, or how to change a header, I'm saying some bloody
well smart folks ask some down right serious questions that would rival any
"challenging" question I've seen posted to wp-hackers.  Generally speaking,
they go unanswered.  I don't think it's a good idea (emphasis on I) to
simply send them to the hackers list.  I think most folks go to the support
forums first.  Some might be savvy enough to find wp-hackers.  My thought
was to meld the two.  Shame on me.

"Melding" isn't going to happen. I understand exactly what you're looking
for, and I don't think anyone on this list *minds* answering a
not-too-repetitive question in the forums. That's _not_ the problem.

The problem is, to answer *these* questions, you must wade through an entire
avalanche of "OMG my sidebar fell" and "Oh Noes! How do I changed my domain
name and now WP don't work!" threads.

If there *was* a way to separate *genuine not-too-repetitive threads* from
the I-refuse-to-google ones, I can promise that there certainly would be
more involvement there. I for one would definitely drop by from time to time
to answer and I'm sure many others will.

It's really simple: find a way to separate the fluff from the real coder's
deal and I'm sure many *will* go to *that section of the forums* and help.

I know it's unfair: after all, how the bloody hell are you supposed to do
that? I'm just giving you a realistic reason. Call it elitism or boredom,
but that's the way it is, and bashing "elitists" won't get it fixed.

-----------------------------

That said, here's an idea:
Add "level tagging"
If a problem isn't a duplicate and has nothing to do with "I want a
ponie-pink header" a moderator can +1 the difficulty level. It's hard to
implement Automattic-side; rather straight-forward actually. 

And improve the search of course...

Before this goes unchallenged, I decided to take the error message from 
that thread and type it into the GIANT search box above the fold on the 
forums home page.

Field 'post_content_filtered' doesn't have a default value

Resulted in this search:

http://wordpress.org/search/Field+%27post_content_filtered%27+doesn%27t+have+a+default+value?forums=1

I then clicked the first 5 results, in order:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/49232
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/51298
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/75879
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/73649
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/82175

*Every single thread* has an answer to the question. For comparison, 
here is a Google [site:wordpress.org/support] for the same terms:

http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awordpress.org%2Fsupport+Field+%27post_content_filtered%27+doesn%27t+have+a+default+value&btnG=Search

The first 3 results are almost the same, just with #2 and #3 switched. 
The first result is exactly the same.

As far as I can tell, $post_content_filtered isn't set anywhere before 
it's used in post.php. Possible hole, let's do the isset() trick and 
also put apply_filters on it so if people wanted to use this field with 
a plugin they could easily.

Sure. Scroll down to the bold "Interesting" on this page.

Call it elitism if you want, but there's more that goes on behind the
scenes than a simple "I'm better than answering stupid questions."
(P.S., that essay is a great one to read the whole way through as
well, it might shed a new view on some of the things that I have said
and will say).

I know you're not asking us to answer the common questions, but the
fact that in order to get to the "challenging" questions we have to
search through hundreds of other questions discourages us from doing
so.

I don't think that we should make the hackers list more available than
it is. The signal to noise ratio of support questions to discussion on
the future of WordPress will skyrocket. If someone can find a way to
truly separate the good questions from the ones that the hackers don't
want to answer, like I believe I said before, you may get more help on
the forums.

Now, to continue what I wanted to write last night, there's a few
other reasons that drove me personally away from the forums when I
used to volunteer. Some can be fixed, others can't.

First, the problem existed then and the problem exists now, the codex
has issues. Looking right now, over the past two hours its been down
for about an hour, and when it has been up it takes an average of 1.9
seconds for the page to start being sent back to your browser. Back
then, the codex was slow, and was constantly giving off 500 errors and
etc. etc. When you want to give help to a question that is clearly
answered on the codex and you can't do it because you can't get to it,
its frustrating to no end.

I think the straw that broke my camel's back personally, however, can
actually be pointed back here. Around the time of the 2.1 launch, the
forums and IRC were pounded with the same question, time after time.
"How do I turn off the WYSIWYG? The option in Options->Writing isn't
working." Its the best example of real-world user feedback I've seen
in WP, and the question is still almost always answered with a "In
your Profile tab, under Users. We know it doesn't make sense either,
but that's where it is."

>  Shame on me.

I don't want you to think any of this is an attack on your idea,
rather its intended to be criticism to help you get the idea done
properly, if it can be done. Just because you started the thread,
don't assume that responses that don't agree 100% are attacks on you
or your idea.

Well first let me apologize for the wording of the original request.  
I agree I should have checked the support forums first. Didn't really  
mean to start a whole other thread on when questions should be posted  
here versus the WP support forum.

My real reason for posting here was more a 'Why doesn't the upload  
section minimize like the other items on the page, Custom Fields for  
example'. I don't want to actually remove the section entirely.  If  
that were the case I know where the code is to rip it out. It's more  
a question of screen real estate. My intention was to possibly have  
this functionality *standardized* and not require a plugin.

- As Matt's search reveals, problems with MySQL 5 and certain queries,
including the post_content_filtered one, were reported in forum post
49232 on Nov 12, 2005.

- The post_content_filtered problem was corrected in the nightlies
(r3539) on Feb 17, 2006.

- The next stable version, version 2.0.2, was released March 10, 2006.
It did not include the r3539 fix for the post_content_filtered problem.

- The problem was mentioned again in forum post 73649 on May 25, 2006,
as well as in earlier and later posts.

- A ticket was filed in late August or early September (Ticket #3112).

- The post_content_filtered problem was corrected again last night in
the nightlies.

Do bugs generally go unfixed for a long time? Clearly not. Can bugs
sometimes go unfixed for a long time, despite the evidence of repeated
forum posts? Yes, it seems so. 

Does it help to hunt for someone or something to blame? No.

I agree with Matt that the forum search function itself is not
functionally substandard. Yes, some users just don't search, they don't
work at the problem. But they may not know enough to know what to search
for. Something isn't working. There is error message splatter on their
screen. If they knew what part of the splatter was the salient part, if
they knew what their problem had in common with some others' problems,
they might find a fix. But they don't have enough technical knowledge to
know that.

And consider the user who does search, and finds messages identifying
changes to WP that seem to stop the problem. Old messages. Message
threads ending with "is anyone going to fix this problem?" Months later
they are having the same problem with stable version code released long
after the messages containing the apparent fixes. They might conclude
that the problem is not with the code, not a bug to be reported (if they
knew how,) since if it were a bug in the code it surely would have been
fixed by now.

I guess in this instance those other "better" experts didn't perform as
expected. Was it a reasonable expectation?

The original observation was that if more coders were looking at what
was being posted in the forums, particularly posts about mysql error
messages, good things would result. The second post in the thread
illustrated, as it turns out, that bugs that were biting users might
have been squashed sooner if there was more or different attention to
forum messages. 

Uncouple that from the suggestion that this list be merged with the
forums, thereby inflicting noise on hackers who do not wish to endure
it. 

Is it worth considering whether the already great approach to
development of an already great piece of software could be improved by
more or different monitoring of forum posts?

Wow. Just wow.
I never read that before, but I just read the entire article over twice. He *knows* exactly what it's like...
Besides the constant ripping on Microsoft (you can program python in Windows even better than you can on linux - one word: VS2k5.. just awesome!), everything he said is true. When I first learned I could do what I do for fun and make money, it was like a miracle come true.

Back to the point at hand:
Like I said before: it doesn't make a difference what you call it, the fact is, it's there. Present a challenge, remove the fluff, and you'll see an immediate change in the number of "experts" (as you call them) there in the forums.

BTW - just want to point out it doesn't really help when you make it seem that it's "our" <job> to provide the support in the forums. For me, that's why I stopped giving help on the online pc support forums. Here, the recognition comes from within the community and stuff. "We" contribute because we enjoy it. WordPress may be a community-powered blogging platform, and without the community WP may not exist, but the fact remains, you just have to rely on good-willed people willing to put up with the forum fluff. I'm the first to admit that *they* are the real heroes who are willing to help and put up with repetitive posts. I used to be like that, but everyone has a limit and an expiration date, I'm afraid my ticker just ran out.

I'm not implying that it's "someone else's job" to answer the tough
questions, I simply suggested that if more of the discussion about WordPress
functions, etc was held in the forums, perhaps more people would have access
to the info and possibly more answers would be given to the tougher
questions.  Period.

After sleeping on it, I wonder if there was a forum that was locked, that
only mods could move threads to, thus giving "hackers" a place to go and
answer tough questions could be a solution (if that's even doable with
bbPress).  The other suggestion of posting to the hackers list threads
marked with a special tag is another (though, that could become a problem,
as just anyone can tag threads, so it would almost have to be a "secret"
tag).   Heck, I'd even be willing to manually post links to threads to the
list if there was an embrace of the idea.  Almost like a digest.

Ultimately, I do respect the work the hackers put forth, and know that I
don't undervalue the discussions.  This was simply motivated by a desire to
consolidate the vast information and knowledge and attempt to stave off
wp-hackers from becoming the "real" support area.  Ultimately, it's just one
opinion.

I've received some questions about bbPress when installed together
with the Finnish translation of WordPress 2.0.5.

>From these questions, it looks like bbPress doesn't use a separate
domain for its translations.  What happens then is that it uses
the WordPress translations, but also has many strings that do not
exist in WordPress.  The result is a mixed language bbPress site.

Would it be possible to add a domain to all __() and _e() calls
in bbPress, please?

That was exactly what I was thinking and tried to say earlier.
Basically, Automattic picks mods and gives them access to specify a special
"level" tag (different from currently existing tag system). "Level Tags"
above a certain level appear in a virtual-category in bbPress, which doesn't
have all the fluff in the mix. It's different, it's not following the
traditional support model, but then again, you do what you have to do to get
things working, right?

(I've read the whole discussion, but am replying to the first to avoid  
attaching this post to any particular reply, since there are several  
germane ones.) I asked a question in the "hacks" forum that (in my *ever*  
so humble opinion) was above the level of "how do I change the color of  
the type" but not really in "hacker" territory. I was told to come to this  
list. So I did. After lurking for a couple of weeks, I'm not sure the  
question belongs here - most of the questions and answers are far above my  
coding skills. I can pick my way through most of the code, but I'm not  
fluent in it. Think of me as a tourist who only knows a few words in a  
foreign language, and mostly relies on a phrase book to get by.

But what's a gal to do? No one *there* could/would answer my question. I'm  
hesitant to inflict my barely-past newbie self on the far more savvy  
members of this list - and I wouldn't, if I could get the answer in the  
forum. So count me as a vote for perhaps a *little* more attention to the  
forums by savvy coders.

That said, as some one in this thread pointed out, nobody's being paid to  
help, and I can understand the frustration of seeing yet another OMG! MY  
MENU DISAPPEARED! post.

So, I'll probably ask my question here anyway. Maybe even today.

I think this is a great idea. I also believe that instead of the "Hot Tags"
cloud (which is worthless in my experience), there should be a list of FAQ's
that are geared to the type of "fluff" like "Where did my sidebar go?".
Also, is there a way to make sure a search is done before the link to "start
a new topic" becomes active. Some kind of cookie that has a short
expiration.

This would be extremely good. Not just that the hackers have somewhere
they can contribute to - but more importantly because it becomes
somewhere to learn. It would become a really valuable real-use example
of code.

The question is how the forum mechanics would work.
It could be a regular forum but policed strictly..? It's worth looking hard at.

Like I had basically mentioned before, a good while back.. I believe it was on the wp-forums list.. Why not make a "WordPress Knowledge Base" section... like phpBB did?
http://www.phpbb.com/kb/categories.php

Make up a few "forums", that only certain people can access, and answer in, maybe... and the mods can relocate such "hard challenging" threads into there.. then, some how let only the "coder pros" access it and answer the questions.. ?

At the sametime.. such hard and challenging threads, will be there, to view only by normal users.. which IMHO, would be good, so they can go there first, hunting an answer to their problems..  

It wouldn't ONLY have to contain the "challenging threads", it could also contain the usual repeat question threads like "Oh no, my sidebar dropped, what do I do?" Of course, add those types of threads, WITH the good answers... I don't know though.. just was suggesting lol..

Message-ID: <ab92f2360611251553j131cb550gc7bea40127c4824b@mail.gmail.com>

I've done this for ages by:

1. Hooking `template_redirect`
2. Including my full template file
3. `die`ing.

It works, but it still feels particularly clunky; for a start, it doesn't
work with all themes (the template has to be edited to fit the particular
HTML, although the inconvenience is sort of minimised by calling
`get_header()` etc.).

Is there a better way to create what is in effect a page? I'm thinking no,
since themes vary so much, but here's hoping! :k

Seems to me there's two things here (I know #1 is mostly what's being 
discussed, but #2 seems to be bleeding in a little...):

1. tagging the 'difficult questions/issues' so that types who love to try to 
crack problems have a quick reading list, and I guess then giving mods the 
ability to apply some kind of tag that's otherwise 'locked' out, or move to 
a category that's locked to question askers, but mods can move them to the 
"Tough Nuts" category when determined to be above the level of the average 
issues...

2. giving another category for people asking questions that are 
'hackery'/programming topics maybe?  I don't think of the "Plugins/Hacks" 
category as being about people WRITING plugins, but people trying to USE 
plugins.  Wouldn't a PHP/Programming topic area be helpful to push certain 
types of question into an area where programmers/hackers could answer those 
things?  So that the hackers list is, again, not the only place one can go 
for such things.. which is the purpose of #1 as well. ;)

Wouldn't work.

As soon as there's more than one page of threads people will stop paging
through them - and it would be no different than the current model. Sure,
the harder questions would be separated, but it does nothing to make people
actually read the back-threads.

Yeah, good point.. ;) I could write up a page in the Codex, or whatever.. for "Common Problems + The Solutions", or something similiar... and then like in my "WP layout" image.. 
http://www.vindictivebastard.net/images2/wpforumlayout2.gif
(Don't worry, viewing from here is safe, the anti-hotlinking .htaccess file is out of there.. lol)

Add a link on the support forum's index page (on left side, like in that image).. pointing to that page in the Codex?  I know this doesn't have to do with the hackers getting the "challenging questions".. but, just was saying for the "general problem" type questions.. and having the answers.. 

Is there some where in the Codex.. that this has/had been started yet, or.. ? Just was wondering if it's even worth doing or not too..?? *Even if*, the people don't see that link on the index page, "we" could direct them to that place in the Codex... I don't know though.. I didn't have enough Pepsi yet, so.. =P

I presume most people would be using a normal email client (as opposed
to a web-based one) so launching the image in the browser would generate
no Referer: header, so it would be safe even if you had the, er, code
activated.

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_page_link by page name/slug?
Message-ID: <f791f4670611260938s675578dbn3b4b0f30e1f0b71d@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know if there is a way in the existing WP core code to get the
hyperlink to a page by it's slug/name?

The reason for asking is that when I develop/maintain a WP theme, the
post/page IDs are completely out-of-step with the production site, and using
the get_page_link() function only allows for the ID (integer).  So it would
be nice to use the page slug/name as this would work seamlessly across both
dev and production environments.

I have written some code to do this...

function get_page_link_by_slug($page_slug) {
>     global $wpdb;
>     $page_id = 0;
>     $results = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE
> post_status = 'static' AND post_name = '$page_slug'");
>     if ($results) {
>         foreach ($results as $result) {
>             $page_id = $result->ID;
>         }
>     }
>     return get_page_link($page_id);

}
> usage: echo get_page_link_by_slug('about');
>

I based the syntax on the get_linkobjectsbyname() function - which adds
another hit on the database, but it saves duplicating the code that formats
the hyperlink.

Would this be useful in the core code? or does anyone know of a better way
of achieving this?

Cheers,
- Lee

Forgive me if I misunderstand, but is the_permalink exactly what you want?

<a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a>

No, I think he's using it not in the loop for the page in question. For a
navigation, eg.

I think that I'm running into a similar problem and was wondering if 
someone could point me in the right direction...

I'm writing a form based plugin which outputs the form like so:
> $form  = "<form action='";
> $form .=    get_permalink();
> $form .= "' method='post'>";
> $form .= "<input type='text' name='my_name' />";
> $form .= "<input type='radio' name='my_action' value='one' />";
> $form .= "<input type='radio' name='my_action' value='two' />";
> $form .= "<input type='submit' name='submit_form' value='submit it' />";
> $form .= "</form>";
If I have the permalink rewrite option turned off, I am able to return 
all of the variables in any of the normal ways (and they all show up 
when using print_r( $_POST ); to display the array).  But when I turn on 
the permalink rewrite option all of the variables disappear.

If anyone has some ideas as to what might be going on, please let me know.

Thanks,

Brian

Yeah, Robin is right... I'm using it in the header/footer of my template
(outside of the loop).

Essentially I wanted a way to link to a page (not a post) regardless of the
permalink structure - but using the slug/name as the reference.

My code works fine, but was more curious if there was a more native way
using the WP-core code?

I don't think there is a function that does this that is in the core. If you
want, feel free to submit it to Trac (trac.wordpress.org).

Message-ID: <10814afb0611270944m107c376tc641e2bb0ec49854@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy folks

I've been playing around with XML-RPC calls today, trying to upload a
new media object (i.e. an MP3 file) using the
metaWeblog.newMediaObject procedure, and I think I may have stumbled
across a bug.

Basically the content of the media file being uploaded needs to be
base64 encoded at the client end, but at the server end,
wp_upload_bits isn't base64-decoding the content again.

I'm using WP 2.0.5, and the following fix, on line 957 of
functions-post.php works for me:

	$success = @ fwrite($ifp, base64_decode($bits));

Any thoughts/comments on this change?

Thanks,
Steve

Hi Steve,

I do not understand the technical details, but I recall I similar
thread "XMLRPC and the patch"
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/009397.html
recently where Peter Westwood wrote:


In xmlrpc.php (http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/xmlrpc.php) we
define a new class:

class wp_xmlrpc_server extends IXR_Server {
	function wp_xmlrpc_server() {

And then instatiate it thereby executing it's constructor:
$wp_xmlrpc_server = new wp_xmlrpc_server();

This is turn calls the constuctor of the base class:
$this->IXR_Server($this->methods);


In the base class constructor from
(http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/class-IXR.php):

    function IXR_Server($callbacks = false, $data = false) {
        ...
        $this->serve($data);
    }
    function serve($data = false) {
        ...
        $this->message = new IXR_Message($data);
        if (!$this->message->parse()) {

The IXR_Mesage class parsing code handles the base64 encoded field as
follows:

    function tag_close($parser, $tag) {
        $valueFlag = false;
        switch($tag) {
	    ...
            case 'base64':
                $value = base64_decode( trim( $this->_currentTagContents
) );
                $valueFlag = true;
                break;

This is where the base64_decode occurs.

Just a note about your query. The post_name column is not a unique.  
Meaning if you have nested pages that end up with the same post_name  
(for whatever reason) your query could pull the wrong one.

What I've seen done that is neat is simply asking people to put in a 
static string, like %%CONTACTFORM%%, in any post/page they want your 
stuff to appear. Then just strstr for that, and if it's there 
str_replace in a filter on post_content.

This is actually what I ended up doing for the new plugin I'm working on,
since I prefer the customisation it offers. It's not practical for every
plugin, though--certainly nothing massively complex or dynamic.

Can you describe said complexity or dynamism? If you really want to
'create a page' you should probably use wp_insert_post() ?

Just display output like this: http://robm.me.uk/library/ (click any of the
books, etc.)

I don't want to create a page and wp_insert_post is not particularly
relevant.

What LLoyd has quoted above is correct.

At the time this was last mentioned I spent some time to review the code
and test it with some clients.

As you can see from the code above the base64 decoding is handled by the
XMLRPC library.

What client are you having trouble with?
Could you send some captures of the HTTP requests sent by the client that
don't get correctly decoded?

The relevant trac ticket for this is: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1008

Is there any documentation on how to use the rewrite hooks/filters in v2.x?
I'm looking to redirect requests.

Example: /wp-admin/images/newfile.png ->
/wp-content/plugins/myplugin/image.png

It's actually for TinyMCE and so that I can add some stuff to it without
actually having to add files to it's folder (which is what it wants me to
do), but the above is a simple example.

I like the content replacing method as above, though it would be nice to
have a method for excluding pages from being displayed by wp_list_pages and
the like. I know wp_list_pages itself has a filter, but you get the HTML
version which makes me a little worried that the markup will change and
cause the removing to break.

Ok.

Your request looks like this:

<methodCall>
 <methodName>metaWeblog.newMediaObject</methodName>
 <params>
  <param>
   <value>
    <array>
     <data>
      <value><string>0</string></value>
      <value><string>steve</string></value>
      <value><string>welcome</string></value>
      <value>
       <struct>
        <member>
         <name>name</name>
         <value><string>09 Do You Speak English_.mp3</string></value>
        </member>
        <member>
         <name>type</name>
         <value><string>audio/mpeg</string></value>
        </member>
        <member>
         <name>bits</name>
         <value><string></string></value>
        </member>
       </struct>
      </value>
     </data>
    </array>
   </value>
  </param>
 </params>
</methodCall>

The bug is here: "<value><string>base64stuff</string></value>"

That should be "<value><base64>base64stuff</base64></value>"

See the XMLRPC [1] and metaweblogapi [2] specs for more info.

Ah! A dumb newbie mistake! Thanks for your help, I've changed this and
it's now working as expected!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Setting post enclosures via XML-RPC
Message-ID: <10814afb0611280529v484f34d8o368a4e695217375@mail.gmail.com>

WP Gurus...

Further to my previous post on metaWeblog.newMediaObject...

I am trying to publish a podcast remotely via XML-RPC. It's all going
well up to a point - I can upload the MP3 remotely, and publish a post
containing a link to this MP3 in the 'Podcast' category. However, I've
come across 1 issue. When the post is published via
metaWeblog.newPost, the enclosures are not set, which is pretty
crucial for a podcast.

I'm happy to create my own XML-RPC function on the server to create
the enclosures for a post (as far as I can see this is just a case of
adding an 'enclosure' meta field to the post), but can anyone here
give me some pointers of which WP functions I should hook in to, to
achieve this? Or, has anyone got some other workaround for this?

Many thanks,
Steve

OK, add_post_meta is the answer, and I've hacked the following
together in xmlrpc.php, in mw_newPost()...

    $meta = $content_struct['meta'];
    if (is_array($meta)) {
      foreach($meta as $key=>$val){
        add_post_meta($post_ID, $key, $val, false);
      }
    }

This is doing the trick for me. I suppose the mw_editPost function
should be edited also for completeness, to allow the post meta to be
updated.

This approach also seems to be acceptable, according to the metaWeblog
API (http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi), i.e.

Where an element has attributes, for example, enclosure, pass a struct
with sub-elements whose names match the names of the attributes
according to the RSS 2.0 spec, url, length and type.

Any chances of getting this change into trunk?

Many thanks,
Steve

2.0.x will maintain the current requirement of 3.23.23.

2.1 will bump the requirement to either 4.0 or 4.1.  We don't currently 
need 4.1 functionality, but MySQL has dropped support for 4.0.  I'm 
thinking we should still target 4.0.  4.0 gives us what we need for now.

I doubt you could do that, as the .htaccess rules specify that any real
directories or files won't get passed to index.php, thus not getting
rewritten.

If a directory /images/ didn't exist on the server, then you could
probably rewrite that. (Don't ask me how.) But you can't really
guarantee that a plugin user wouldn't have the /images/ directory.

if /wp-admin/images/newfile.png doesn't exist, then it will pass it to the
rewriter. It doesn't matter if the directory exists or  not in this case. At
least that's my understanding.

Yeah, I've wanted that for a while.  Plugins should be able to add to  
the exclude list, and it might even be worth having per-page "Display  
in page listings: [x]" option.  Currently you have to hack the theme  
to hide pages, and this is incredible user-unfriendly.  I've taken to  
doing <?php wp_list_pages('exclude=' . my_page_excludes()); ?> so I  
only have to edit one thing to change global page excludes.

Yeah, I'm doing this with a file that doesn't actually exist. I just want to
make TinyMCE think it exists. Completely possible, I just don't know how to
hook into the new rewrite system. :(

Look at a plugin that uses it, like UTW.  Don't know of any good

Here's one way we could use 4.1 functionality.  The last time I
checked, query_posts("cat=-3") excludes posts of category 3 only if
the post isn't categorized under other categories.  If it is assigned
another category, then it's returned.  To fix this with MySQL
functionality < 4.1 would be a hassle.

With the sub-query functionality introduced in MySQL 4.1, we could
easily use a sub-query to define what we're excluding.

I think there are other WordPress functions where sub-queries would
provide a more efficient and precise way of excluding results.  Since
as you mention MySQL has discontinued support for 4.0 already, and
we're going to bump the minimum version anyways, why not go to 4.1?

I ran into this the other day, which is kind of funny. It sure would
be nice to have the ability to exclude multiple categories, and if
MySQL has dropped support for 4.0, I agree it might be better to go
that route as well.

Not that I know anything about any of this, but I thought it was funny
that I just ran into this problem of not being to exclude multiple
categories a few days ago.

This is the minimum version for the plugins based on 2.1 as well, and I'm
sure plugins like TagWarrior would be helped a heap with having access to
sub-queries.

Another +1 for 4.1's subqueries.  And if MySQL has dropped support  
for 4.0, that's another reason to go for 4.1

Agreed. WordPress may not need 4.1 instead of 4.0, but I know it'd sure be
nice for plugins to be able to rely on the version bump.

Another +1 here, but for another reason. We don't want the MySQL  
minimum version to be a moving target from release to release. I  
think it's better to make a bigger (version # wise) jump to 4.1, with  
the hopes that we can make that the baseline for the next year or three.

Well put. I'll come out of lurking to add my +1, for whatever it's
worth. No use in going with 4.0 if mysql has dropped support of it and
we can just as easily go to 4.1. And with continued support of 2.0.x
for 3.23, as Ryan mentioned earlier, it sounds like a perfect
solution.

I've raised an enhancement in Trac for this (after revising my

Subject: [wp-hackers] Replacing TinyMCE with Xinha
Message-ID: <007d01c713cd$8dbd3800$a937a800$@net>

I've always wondered why WP used TinyMCE as the WYSIWYG editor. It doesn't
result in the best code, it's not 100% xhtml compatible, it's not _that_
"tiny," and most importantly, there are better alternatives out there.

I'm currently using Xinha (http://xinha.python-hosting.com/) to add WYSIWYG
support to my commenting form, simply because of how many people throw in
unencoded html characters that cut their post short. It looks great, can be
configured to be even more minimal than TinyMCE, is compatible with all
current-generation browsers AFAIK, and most importantly, by using the new
rendering engine guarantees valid XHTML.

Here's a link to a Xinha-rigged comment form:
http://neosmart.net/blog/archives/291#comment-7324
It looks 100% natural and is very light (unlike FCKeditor), and has full
theming support via CSS (I believe).

It has the same exact feature that has only just been implemented in 2.1:
html and WYSIWYG tabs, switchable via AJAX though.

I use the pure HTML editor for writing posts, but my biggest turn-off in
TinyMCE was how it completely mangled <a> tags, inserting many non-standard
attributes that are absolutely unnecessary and serve no function as far as I
can see but to create trouble and wreck havoc when TinyMCE is pulled (I had
to rewrite all posts done with a WP 1.5 TinyMCE plugin after deleting it and
switching to 2.0 - though that particular issue no longer exists in WP's
TMCE, it _does_ still add non-standard & useless attributes to the <a>
tags).

Moreover, this would be a chance to do something we've long promised and
talked about: removing the WYSIWYG from the actual WP-Core and making it a
plugin.

A plugin for Xinha on WordPress already exists, you may've seen it before:
http://baptiste.us/plugins/xinha4wp

My favorite thing about Xinha is the plugin system for the editor itself,
it's much more straight-forward and *global* than TMCE's current plugin
system and using this might encourage and simplify the use of
editor-plugins. Xinha for WordPress ships with quite a few that are verified
working 100% (I've checked them all on WP 2.1) including PHPSpell/ASpell
support. It has several default plugins that make writing code and accessing
the HTML tags from the WYSIWYG interface without actually switching to the
HTML-view really easy as well.

I'm sure this is going to irk some people off, TMCE has been there for a
while and stuff, but I just think that TMCE has really outlived its purpose.
It was made when the online blogging revolution along with Web 2.0 began,
and it's really just sloppy work compared to some of the more professional
follow-ups, whether they be Xinha or others.

Just food for thought, something to consider, and it's definitely not hard
seeing as the entire GPL'd plugin platform exists. Should this actually be
considered, as simple as reviewing the plugin's code, trashing TMCE, and
shipping WP with Xinha....

(Think of it this way: Way more people will switch to 2.1 when you tell them
there's a new WYSIWYG engine that looks great, has tons of functions, and
produces 100% valid XHTML!!! =P)

Message-ID: <BBC0061A-FF03-4D38-923F-5A3277F9244C@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a bit of n00b on the hacker mailing list.  I love the wordpress  
db upgrade script.  I have found it helpful in many ways, but it I  
have always noticed the lack of foreign key support in the script.   
NO MORE!  I have made modifications to the script so that there is  
now support for adding and upgrading foreign keys for InnoDB tables  
in MySQL.  My question is, is there a need for this in Wordpress?  I  
have not seen any foreign keys in the db schema to date (hence the  
lack of support for handling them I dare say .. ).  I am interested  
in contributing this work back to the community that has given me so  
much.

Thanks.

Well, from a non-code-savvy moose, if this indeed is the case, then it gets
a +1 from me, and may even make me feel comfortable to not only tell my
friends that they should use the WYSIWYG editor, but use it myself!

Many users don't use WYSIWYG, so I always wonder why it's in the "core". I'm 
all for a lean & mean core, so anything that goes towards achieving this 
gets a +1 from me. Everything else can be plugged in IMHO.

Hi!

In changeset 4227 is_feed is preserved even when no posts are found.
This is good.

Question: should we really still return HTTP 404?  I'm thinking maybe
not, as we are returning a valid "empty" feed.  In other words, the URL
for the feed is correct (the feed was found ok), there are just no items
in the feed.

Best regards,

Write bugs.  They will be passed to Moxie for fixage.

xinha does look pretty nice, but we're not doing an editor change for 
2.1.  There's not enough time for that.

Fulltext index only works with MyISAM. Switching to InnoDB is going to be a
carnage.

All the more reason to tag & branch 2.1, as time goes on more and more
ideas/requests will fall under this category.

Why not just add a ticket in trac with 2.2 milestone ? :)

Even better would be tinyMCE tickets for 2.1. :-)

I agree with Ryan that there isn't enough time to be able to ship it out
with 2.1. Although +1 for tagging and branching. Release 2.1 and then have a
branch that includes Xinha and one that has TinyMCE that will be used for
tagging bugfix releases. Any bugfix release can be tagged from the TinyMCE
and the Xinha can be the trunk.

According to this page active support for 4.1 ends on 2006-12-31,
4.0 support ended on 2006-09-30.
Is it such a difference whether 4.0 or 4.1 regarding support?
4.0 will get extended support till 2008-12-31, 4.1 till 2009-12-31.

Agreed, but the executive decision was that people are noobs, so WYSIWYG
editors are good for them.

And Xinha could easily be made into a plugin to replace TinyMCE in the
meantime.

Good point, but there is a difference. It was mentioned that plugins
will benefit from the extra features of 4.1, which 4.0 doesn't have.

If feature availability for plugins is important, let's up the
requirement to PHP 5 too -- bring the whole project into 2004, not
just the database. ;)

I'm not religiously tied to TinyMCE, but Xinha was pretty fragile in my 
playing with it, and overall the codebase seems much less mature. We 
have good upstream support from the MCE guys, good repeatable bug 
reports (Denis' isn't) usually get fixed.

Sure they are. Send it to whoever is maintaining TinyMCE, he'll readily
reproduce them. If you need anything more specific, though:

If I recall correctly, weird things sprout when you hit the Return key
several times fast enough. Likely due to the way the script manages <p> and
<br> tags, i.e. we've got concurrent calls to the function when users type
too fast, and they produce weird output. The same occurs for other combos,
but this one was the most obvious.

I haven't the slightest clue why the divs come up exactly, but it should be
obvious to whoever created the validation script that, given the reported
bug, empty <div> tags should be corrected as <div></div> rather than plain
<div />.

For the front page bug, paste junk, e.g.:

<html><head><title>yada</title></head><body>yada</body></html>

And see TinyMCE accept the above unchanged instead of grabbing the part in
the body.

Lastly, I don't paste from Word, but a few of my customers certainly do.
They and others expect it to work because it's "bloody obvious" to them that
a list gets formatted as a list no matter where you paste it to or from.
Grab a few lists, tables, indents, etc. from Word97, paste in FCKEditor, it
almost always works. Do the same in TinyMCE, and you almost always need to
edit the resulting html source code. In particular, to remove <div />, <p />
and <script /> tags.

Well, that ticket said nothing, but the obvious: Don't paste FrontPage 
code into the WordPress editor.
That goes for any other situation as well.
By the way, the link to the FrontPage page ends in space ;)

Sub-queries are pretty rough in 4.1, they're really not fast until 
5.0/5.1. It's just blog software, we don't really need anything that fancy.

Sure would help those big customers like the NYTimes, right? ;-)

Denis,

I agree there are bugs in TinyMCE, but I also agree that the TinyMCE folks
have been squashing them fairly quickly.  I built a plugin for TinyMCE
(http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com) that's been used in WPG2
(http://wpg2.galleryembedded.com) for the past six months, so I feel I have
a little credibility on the matter.

That said, I think your specific example is not a good one.  Any editor for
a part of a page should strip out the <html> and <head> tags.  The shell (in
this case WordPress) is responsible for those parts.  The subparts of a page
should not try to have their own <html> and <head> tags, they should only be
a part of the <body> tag.  Unless I'm totally missing what you're trying to
do.

I'm not religiously tied to TinyMCE either.  I can modify my Gallery2 plugin
for any editor with a good plugin system.  If we're going to look at a new
editor, though, I'd recommend a look at FCKEditor, too.  It has fairly wide
support among the other CMS-type software.

I think it is worth noting that one of my favorite "big CMS" projects,
Joomla (http://www.joomla.org) is also using TinyMCE as its default WYSIWYG
editor.  Joomla also has a good plugin system that allows you to choose
other editors, but it is their default, too.

Sure they are. Send it to whoever is maintaining TinyMCE, he'll readily
reproduce them. If you need anything more specific, though:

If I recall correctly, weird things sprout when you hit the Return key
several times fast enough. Likely due to the way the script manages <p> and
<br> tags, i.e. we've got concurrent calls to the function when users type
too fast, and they produce weird output. The same occurs for other combos,
but this one was the most obvious.

I haven't the slightest clue why the divs come up exactly, but it should be
obvious to whoever created the validation script that, given the reported
bug, empty <div> tags should be corrected as <div></div> rather than plain
<div />.

For the front page bug, paste junk, e.g.:

<html><head><title>yada</title></head><body>yada</body></html>

And see TinyMCE accept the above unchanged instead of grabbing the part in
the body.

Lastly, I don't paste from Word, but a few of my customers certainly do.
They and others expect it to work because it's "bloody obvious" to them that
a list gets formatted as a list no matter where you paste it to or from.
Grab a few lists, tables, indents, etc. from Word97, paste in FCKEditor, it
almost always works. Do the same in TinyMCE, and you almost always need to
edit the resulting html source code. In particular, to remove <div />, <p />
and <script /> tags.

Denis

So maybe Xinha can ship as a plugin and put a link on the write page so that
you can switch between the two.

wrote my plugin.)  They don't want to have to learn HTML.  Photos are nice,
too, so long as they don't have to learn HTML to do it.

It's easy enough to disable the WYSIWYG if you don't like it.  (And only a
coder geek usually bothers to figure out how to disable it.  I proudly
include myself in the "coder geek" category, although I do use TinyMCE when
I'm writing my blog entries.)

I think we need the ability to exclude multiple categories, and if
subqueries is the fancy item we need to achieve that without a nasty,
nasty query, then I think we need it. And do you have benchmarks or a
quantifiable difference between the 4.1 and 5.x? A few minutes of
searching produced nothing on the subject.

Include as a plugin, like Akismet. It will still be there to activate if you 
need it. I'm not arguing against including WYSIWYG with WP. I guess when I 
think of core code, I think of bare essentials, especially when the system 
already employs a plugin framework. WYSIWYG is non-essential code, therefore 
should be a plugin. The plugin is a click away from activation. Or ship WP 
with tinyMCE (or Xinha) plugin pre-activated.

WYSIWIG is different from Akismet.  You might not need akismet if you
have a small, local blog, or are just starting out.

But those are the people who definitely want/need a WYSIWIG.  WP is so
darn proud of the "five minute install" (and rightfully so), a good
WYSIWIG is a key part of the same message, IMHO.

So plug-in or not, I think it needs to be there from the start.

Just because it's in a plugin that's shipped with the core doesn't mean it
won't be there. It can be activated automatically, so Joe Blogger can still
have the WYSIWYG but people, like me and a lot of code-savvy people, can
deactivate it easily.

We've only had this Make TinyMCE a Plugin v. Keep It In the Core fight
about 5000 times now. I don't think this thread was made to bring on
this argument (again... browse the archives
<http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/> if you want). So
let's keep it that way, please?

Taking it back to the topic, +1 if Xinha truly is lighter and better.
I'd love for WP to ditch the bulkiness and bugginess of tinyMCE for
something better.

And even if it slower performing, slow performance for the occasional query
is a lot better than none at all.

I'm not sure about the last instalment, but since it's brought up again, I 
thought I'd put in my 2 cents. And yes, the thread did start out with this 
premise in mind...

It won't matter which WYSIWYG editor to include with WP, because if they are 
both plugins then either can be activated at the discretion of the user. But 
for those fanatical tinyMCE fans out there, I don't see a problem with 
pre-activating a tinyMCE plugin at install time. And for purists like 
myself, it just makes it a little easier just to deactivate it if I don't 
use it.

A few things.

* A WYSIWYG editor in the core is here to stay. Stop wasting your breath.
Read this if you're interested in the details:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3256

* The TinyMCE folder can be deleted (if you don't want to upload it) and it
won't result in any problems thanks to this ticket/changeset added to 2.1 a
month ago: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3272

And yes, back to the topic of TinyMCE vs. Xinha...

That's a pretty big requirement.

What do you mean by "add stuff to Xinha?"
Plugins? Hooks? Yes.

After having a look at the ticket, it seems the person that closed it didn't 
fully comprehend the issue. No one disputed the fact that it was "too 
valuable to the target audience". The question was whether it should have 
been in the *core*. sheesh!

"Code is poetry". I don't see anything too poetic or elegant about this 
solution, but it's still a solution I guess.

Think of it as future proofing... People are going to be running on 5.0 and
5.1 anyway, why not let them get the full benefit of the subqueries, and the
guys on 4.1 just have the small performance hit when (and hopefully not
often) one is used.

That's basically how it works now.  All you have to do is delete the / 
wp-includes/js/tinymce/ folder and it will be gone.  I specifically  
put in code making sure that simple deletion of TinyMCE would result  
in a graceful disappearance.  My little gift to fellow <textarea />

The discussion wasn't whether it was buggy or not.

> http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008463.html

I agree that we need to focus development on the needs of the average user. 
Bundling non-essential features in a pre-activated plugin will not negate 
that. The average user will go to the write screen and still notice a nifty 
RTE.

At the end of the day, this discussion is moot if the powers that be have 
set their mind on tinyMCE being core.

Here is a semi-noob look at this, as I class myself as technically aware
rather than a programmer.

Most of my installations are running WP2.0.4 now. I didn't upgrade to 2.0.5
because there was a reported bug that slipped through, and whilst Mark
created a plugin to fix it, as a user I would expect 2.0.5.1 or 2.0.6 to be
released a few days later to clear up the problem.

I haven't received notification of this, so I am still running old code. I
don't live in Trac, but maybe the 2.0.5 distribution was patched without
notification.

I tried using TinyMCE for a while, but after a number of disasters with the
formatting of posts that were only visible after they were published, I
don't trust it enough to use it on any live blog, and I haven't got a huge
amount of time for testing it specifically to be able to provide useful bug
reports.

If something works sufficiently well to use it on a day to day basis, and I
can just drop someone an email to report a bug rather than wading through
trac, I am much more inclined to report bugs.

As an example of that, I have reported 2 important bugs to MyBlogLog in the
past couple of days, and each time I received a nice email back, actually
from the owner thanking me.
In Firefox there is some form of automatic reporting, I don't have to go to
a special place to send crash data.

I don't expect personal thankyou notes for reporting Wordpress bugs, but
maybe there is a need for an easier reporting method. A built in bug report
form and someone at the other end who enters data into trac?

WYSIWYG editors are good for noobs, if they don't make a total abortion of
simple code that might prove impossible for a noob to fix.

Here is an example I just created

http://andybeard.eu/2006/08/backdated-post-to-demo-tinymce-bug.html

I stopped using TinyMCE when this happened to me twice when I didn't notice
it until the next day, and then further to that when I had to manually go
through 2 long posts fixing all the junk strong tags that had been added.
Actually one of those posts I ended up re-editing for strong tags 3 times
before it was finally published.
I also had to go through the added pain of working out how to persuade
Feedburner to refetch my feed after it had been already notified, but
hopefully before the feed had been picked up in too many places and cached.

The bug doesn't display in the WYSIWYG editor, only in the preview, but if
all you have done is changed some line spacing, there is a good chance you
won't pick it up before publishing. A newbie wouldn't know how to fix it.

Maybe things like this are fixed in the version of TinyMCE that is in 2.0.5
but because I am not inclined to update to a version that has been reported
as being bugged in other ways, I won't find out.

If it was a plugin, I am sure I would have updated it by now

I don't see the need for a quick 2.0.5.1 / 2.0.6 in this case - the issue
is minor and only affects a limited user base - Mark's plugin provides the
fix for you _if_you need it.

Don't forget 2.0.5 contained security updates.

No it wasn't - and that wouldn't be good (/me remembers the support
nightmare the one time long ago the download zip file was updated as bugs
in the release where found - the people providing support in IRC found
there code didn't match what people had just downloaded - it was a
nightmare!)

Reporting by email only really works on small projects - trac is where we
as a community collect, triage and fix issues - if you really want to
report by email then wp-testers is the place to go - people on that list
will take you issue suggest a fix (and create the trac ticket for you if
your lucky)

Marks plugin clearly wasn't official, and the way it read to me was that
there was a chance of an official version in the very near future.
Some of the installation instructions require more than most newbie skills.
A newbie is just going to hit the upgrade button in Fantastico.

As for wp-testers, it represents 0.1% of the Wordpress userbase. Has the
number of users grown in proportion to the userbase? I doubt it very much.
What percentage of the testers list are normal users rather than
programmers? Having to join a mailing list to report a bug is not going to
inspire most users.

Subject: [wp-hackers] TinyMCE plugins outside TinyMCE's plugin directory
Message-ID: <8f93a7390611300403m379a4258n196ace0b1f86d4e@mail.gmail.com>

So I've spent the better part of last night and early this morning working
on this, so at this point I may be well out of my mind. Forgive me if I make
a stupid mistake.

Since ButtonSnap no longer works with the new version of TinyMCE that's in
WP 2.1, I've been adding buttons via TinyMCE plugins (external +
tinymce_before_init + tinyMCE.loadPlugin). However, TinyMCE apparently is
hard coded to look in it's own directory for language files resulting in
funny titles for the buttons (untranslated strings).

JS being clientside, I figured I'd just trick TinyMCE into thinking I had a
real, internal plugin in it's folder via a rewrite. I'd call
/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/myplugin/, but it'd actually reside in
/wp-content/plugins/myplugin/tinymce/ or whatever.

I got the rewrite working just fine via the internal PHP class (if you
access the URL of where it should be, it shows up as if it was really
there), however it seems the TinyMCE gzip script is making me fail. It
actually reads the files and compresses them or whatnot. And since my plugin
isn't really there, it doesn't read/compress/output it and so TinyMCE never
sees it. Bah.

Simply put, does anyone have any ideas? Going back to external plugins isn't
the end of the world, but it'd be nice if I could pull this or something
similar off. Perhaps some hooks or filters in the gzip script?

I also was also hoping to use this so I could make a dynamic
editor_plugin.js (like editor_plugin.php and rewrite to it) because I have
multiple buttons that I need to individually be able to turn on and off.
However, I guess I can just show them all and then hide buttons via CSS.
Right now I just have an external plugin for each and every button (what a
pain!).

You don't, and in fact, I'm sure the rest of the wp-hackers mailing list
agrees that we'd really rather you _didn't_ sign up for the list to report
bugs.  It's not what the list is for and people are simply going to redirect
you to Trac anyways.

Exactly, especially if they are the same users who find difficulty in 
activating an RTE plugin in the first place.

Some quick performance tests could answer this... it might be that 
subqueries don't really cause a performance hit (might even still improve 
performance) under 4.x versus current multi-query approaches.

"It's just blog software, we don't really need anything that fancy."

That's the worst thing I've ever heard you say here.

WP is a competitive blogging (and CMS) platform.  It's being used not only 
for individual installations on shared servers (some with heavy usage), but 
bigger installs on dedi servers, all the way up to NYT and the like which 
are likely multi-server or at least heavy multi-processor boxes.  We're also 
seeing more use of it as CMS via Pages, and heavy multi-user installations 
like WP.com via WPMU.

Why wouldn't we want to take advantage of new (to MySQL, not to the rest of 
the SQL world...), higher-performing features like sub-queries, that can 
take load off BOTH the php box and the sql box?

With all the people who have to run WP-Cache2 in order to not have their 
provider take down their site for heavy php and sql use, with all the sites 
who live or die on the platform, we need every 'fancy' bit we can get.

Not to start a war or anything, but I think David's right. Ever since 1.5 WP
has become notorious for its rather in-efficient database. I'm NOT (let me
repeat: NOT) a database expert and all I know about MySQL is just how to
create a database that does the job. But I think there is something missing
from WP's database performance.

When you have forums like phpBB and IPB that can take up to 100 or more
times the load as WP _without caching_ and they serve quite a lot more
queries, I think that means something is wrong.

IMO, WP being inefficient at DB-querying is something that already happened,
and unless someone is volunteering to completely redo the database with full
optimizations and proper schemas taking advantage of all of MySQL's
(admittedly few) SQL-Side power tools, there's nothing to be done. But
ignoring these features for future changes and feature-sets is another
story...

Just my two cents..

Hi, everyone. Apologies for the cross-post.

Just a quick note to extend my sincere thanks to all of you folks who donate
your time and talents to making WordPress a success. I am discontinuing my
subscription to these mailing lists so that the signal to noise ratio is
reduced. I expect that you will all continue to contribute in your own
unique ways to the project, and I expect that you will all keep the average
user in mind as you further the evolution of the best publishing package on
the internet.

Keep up the good (and often thankless) work.

Best wishes to you all.

Amen to all of that.  Take, for instance, Flopping Ace's recent
disparaging of WordPress due to the fact that his WP site was taken
down by traffic generated by the bogus "6 burned Sunnis" story:
http://floppingaces2.blogspot.com/2006/11/msm-patting-themselves-on-back.html

He used to have a fairly attractive and heavily-trafficked WP site but
when push came to shove, WP couldn't handle the load.  MT's static
publishing might be a pain in the butt and have its own downsides, but
MT-run sites run circles around WP sites when it comes to a digging,
/.'ing, Penny Arcade "wanging" or an Instalanche.  I can't tell you
how many frickin' times I've seen that WP "Error reaching the
database" error screen on blog posts carelessly dugg.  I loathe
Diggmirror, but such circumstances seemingly leave regular readers
with  no choice.

So a hearty +1DAM, +20 to hit on doing whatever we have to do to make
the mysql portion of WP work better.

Besides the DB, the entire frontend is also just as inefficient. Take a look
at http://lightpress.org/ 

I've launched several clients with LightPress, because I was custom-coding
their entire site anyway. But for the average user, that's just not an
option.

LightPress is a total revamp of the theming system and the GUI. It's
installed as a plugin on top of WP, and is _NOT_ a fork of WP.
Unfortunately, development there is (understandably) slow.

 
My point in all this isn't that WP sucks or that you should use Lightpress
along with it, but rather that from the very bottom (the database) to the
very top (the frontend), WP is inefficient. Very inefficient.

With WP 1.5 that wasn't a problem. *THEN* it was "just a blogging platform,"
but now, WP is much, much more. The sad thing is, WP is getting too large to
rewrite. Because a rewrite is the only thing that can fix it. And a rewrite
at this point would kill compatibility.

Ideally, we'd say 'screw compatibility,' release 2.1, take a 6-8 month break
from coding new features and in this time re-create the database taking
advantage of all MySQL-specific optimizations, bump up the MySQL minimum
version and take advantage of all the new performance features offered, and
then re-implement LightPress as a part of the core. The actual WP code is
marvelously well-written, clear, and fairly concise compared to other
projects of its size - only the frontend needs to be redone per the
LightPress specifications. 

But that's not going to happen. I don't see why not, Firefox was rewritten
from scratch several times (not that it helped, Fx's code is absolutely
ghastly and leaks memory more than Hoover Dam has water) - and that was a
MUCH bigger project than WP.
The only thing is, Firefox was rewritten to improve the quality of the code,
and not the performance. i.e. the rewritten Firefox was kept 100% backwards
compatible during the rewrite. However, for WP, that would require the
breaking of quite a few plugins just to make it even slightly faster.

No matter how you look at it, WP is horribly inefficient and now it's
definitely big enough that this warrants a second look. We need to do
something, the only question is, what?

As far as the DB goes, I feel we can (if we wanted to) rewrite it without
breaking compatibility, since we just have to keep the functions the same.
Officially, WP doesn't support plugins or themes that grab info from the
database themselves - that's what the hooks are for, so we don't have to
worry about breaking those kind of things.

But no DB-rewrite is complete without rewritten functions (the LightPress
bit), and that's a bit of a conundrum. After all, WP's biggest advantage is
the millions of plugins and themes and the huge community that builds them -
not something to be taken lightly or trifled with in this manner.


.... I hate endings like this.. Please, someone, think of something!

I'm not saying you're wrong, but could you quantify this inefficiency?
 In other words, how are you measuring it especially in comparison
with other platforms?

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress, web standards, and (X)HTML
Message-ID: <1164913734.4963.207.camel@galahad>

It's been suggested that we move this discussion
[ http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3406 ] from Trac to this mailing
list.

WordPress bills itself on its homepage as producing standard markup.

By default, WordPress produces a variation on XHTML 1.0 markup which is
always served as text/html. There appears to be no effective enforcement
of conformance to protect against user "stupidity" or misbehaving
plugins. As a result, /in practice/, many (if not most) WordPress blogs
include non-conformant, even non-validating, pages.

XHTML 1.0 should be served as application/xhtml+xml to supporting user
agents. Serving XHTML 1.0 as text/html was envisaged by the XHTML 1.0
specification writers as a compatibility hack for legacy browsers, not
as the main MIME type for XHTML 1.0 content.

There is no specification for how user agents should parse or render
XHTML 1.0 served as text/html, except that they should try and mimic
rival user agents' error recovery:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines

http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2854.html#page-3

Most user agents hand such XHTML over to the same tag soup parsers that
parse any other HTML. These parsers are only capable of rendering XHTML
1.0 acceptably because of their historical failure to conform to the
HTML 4.01 specification in the first place. Worse, certain JavaScript
and CSS techniques that work with documents served as text/html will not
work when the same documents are served as application/xhtml+xml. For
this and other reasons, many consider serving XHTML 1.0 as text/html at
all to be bad practice:

http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml

http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware_of_xhtml.php

I like XHTML. But I believe that best practice is to either:

1) Serve XHTML 1.1 or modular XHTML to user agents that can handle
application/xhtml+xml correctly and HTML 4.01 Strict to user agents that
cannot.

OR

2) More simply, serve HTML 4.01 Strict to everyone.

I can understand why WordPress developers should be loathe to break
existing templates. Rather than breaking existing templates, I suggest
that a standards-compliance mode be implemented where either 1) or 2)
takes place.

At the /very least/, WordPress should serve XHTML 1.x as
application/xhtml+xml to supporting user agents and reserve text/html
for non-supporting user agents. 

Such a change will be crucial if WordPress wishes to eventually migrate
to Web Applications 1.0 or XHTML 2.0.

If this forces WordPress to double-check markup for well-formedness,
validity, and conformance, so much the better. People put a lot of
effort into writing their blogs. They deserve markup that user agents
can read correctly if they follow the specifications; markup that will
still be parsable in a hundred years time when Internet Explorer and
Firefox will be long forgotten.

P.S. XHTML 1.1 should NEVER be served as text/html. To do so with the
WordPress blog itself [ http://wordpress.org/development/ ] radically
undermines WordPress's claim to be the choice for those who want
standard markup. (Yes, it validates. The W3C Validator pretends all
XHTML documents were received with the proper application/xhtml+xml MIME
type.)

No problem.
My site has a blog (WordPress), a gallery (Gallery2), and a forum (hacked
MyTopix).
Each has been dugg and slashdotted several times. It used to be that
Gallery2 was the weak point, it would kill my server the minute it made even
OSNews, never mind Slashdot. The Menalto Gallery2 team worked really hard
and fixed that up.

The forums were simultaneously dugg and slashdotted - they upheld
wonderfully, and the server only slowed down a bit.

The blog - once it gets a whiff of Slashdot or Digg without WP-Cache
installed (I *STILL* can't get it working on IIS and the author isn't really
helpful) my server collapses.
I have eAccelerator installed, I gzip content, and I have IIS tuned to the
hilt (much faster than Apache :P)

Flash Back a couple of months

WP + WP-Cache goes down much faster than the forums - no eAccelerator.


Gallery2 has some kind of very inefficient caching taking place, the forums
have no caching, and WP used to have WP-Cache.


The gallery & forums make a ton of more (and more complex) queries to the
database - and forums are especially heinous because of how often the
content changes. Yet something like WP gives me hell. And I'm not alone.

I removed all my plugins and installed LightPress for 24 hours - the effect
was instantaneous bliss. Still no caching, but all of a sudden not only did
my server not die on me every 5 minutes, but pages also loaded fast and
snappily.

WordPress performance under load vs. Movable Type (static publishing)
performance under load.  MT whips WP, but it's actually kind of a
"cheat" - the entries themselves are statically generated and stored.
Any dynamic elements (comments, plug-ins, etc.) are then generated
on-the-fly.

As I stated above, a good metric is the consummate *thrashing*
out-of-the-box WP sites take when dugg/slashdotted/etc.

My 2c. I have been seriously in the throes of the MT/WP performance  
issues for months now. Neither platform really has it nailed. In MT  
if you go to static publishing, which is faster for the end user, the  
editorial experience is impossibly slow. I finally found and used an  
undocumented page caching scheme (built into MT!) to help the overall  
scene. Nevertheless, we have bitten the bullet and moved to WP.

On WP, out of the box there are some expensive queries that are  
significantly remedied simply by adding indexes to certain tables. We  
run one installation under eAccelerator, and one under  
phpAccelerator. And after the database optimization, I still plan to  
install a hard page caching scheme, since the queries for paged  
category archives are the only slow queries that remain. (FWIW, WP- 
Cache does not behave well in either install.)

Well we need to determine what makes lightpress so much faster.  Is it 
the queries, the templates, the cache?  Is it bypassing expensive 
filters such as texturize and autop?  It's actually quite a bit of extra 
code, so what is speeding it up?  A little thing I see in lightpress 
that I would like for WP is plugin contexts.

Maybe someone using lightpress could dump their queries and query times 
for comparison.

What indexes did you add?  We added a few more in 2.1, but if there are 
still more we should add do let us know.

Also, are we talking about 2.0.x or 2.1 here?  We've done some query 
optimization in 2.1, but we could use still more.

Hi Ryan,

Using 2.04 (2.1 not ready yet, right?)

These are the ones I added, made a huge difference in performance --  
we have 17000 posts and fairly heavy traffic.
I checked my slow query log, and used EXPLAIN to examine what was  
going on and added indexes for columns referenced in where statements:

CREATE INDEX cat_name ON wp_categories (cat_name);
CREATE INDEX post_date ON wp_posts (post_date);
CREATE INDEX post_date_gmt ON wp_posts (post_date_gmt);
CREATE INDEX post_status ON wp_posts (post_status);

Additionally, I have hacked the WP admin interface to make it more  
usable, adding more metadata to to the list of posts, and adding a  
browse category drop down and a separate Drafts page. Don't know if  
these can be incorporated into the new version, or if other UI  
optimizations are already taking place...

wp-cache/Staticize needs to be adopted into the core (even if it's as a 
plugin still).  Nothing beats the performance of fully-static HTML, but 
mostly-static php can get close. ;)

Maybe that should branch off into another thread... ;)

Trying to get back to the point (this thread isn't about Wordpress
being slow, or about moving up to PHP 5) I'm wondering what this
comment from Matt means.

It sounds like the support for 4.1 isn't really that much different
from 4.0, but I still like the idea of having sub-query support, and
I'm listening for any reasons as to why choosing 4.0 would be any
better. If it's a simple "the lower the version number the better"
kind of answer, that's cool.

I agree with Viper007bond, though - isn't having a slower than ideal
implementation of sub-queries better than none?

Is there a compelling reason to choose 4.0 over 4.1?

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.1 Alpha new-post.php issue
Message-ID: <AC82A222-466D-4CBE-A0F2-D42FA7F9AD23@mac.com>

Hey guys,

Sorry if this doesn't belong here, but considering no one in IRC knew  
what was wrong and I don't think that anyone on the forums would know  
about this, I thought that coming here might be worth a shot. If this  
doesn't belong here, I'd love it if someone could kindly point me to  
where it does.

I've come along a slight issue with the latest trunk nightly (Nov. 29  
& 30 so far). I started this thing off at 2.0 and upgraded to 2.1  
alpha a while ago (can't remember the exact date, but possibly 2-3  
weeks ago) off of trunk, and thought it might be nice to upgrade to  
the latest nightly build as I'm launching this thing on Friday. So I  
upgraded to the first nightly (you don't know how stupid I feel  
now).    Something went horribly wrong. Every time I loaded the post  
screen, its load time clocked in at +/- 30 seconds. Then I tried the  
second nightly, and the same thing happened. As a first instinct,  
with the help of a few people in #wordpress, I checked out the mysql  
queries to see if anything was taking longer than it should.  
Everything was running just as it should have been, nothing was  
abnormally slow (see results here - http://pastebin.ca/262036). Next  
someone suggested that I should disable the cron, which I did.  
Nothing changed at all. No one else but me is experiencing this problem.

Then I thought, "hey, maybe I should check how PHP is handing this".  
I took a look at PHP, and it seems that something is going really  
wrong with the fcgi module. Every time the page loads, the CPU usage  
of the php5.fcgi module goes up to +/-10%. I'm just not sure what it  
could be. For those of you who are wondering, my host is Dreamhost.

I'm starting to get the idea that it might be my host, but the fact  
that it was working fine before I upgraded to the alpha is bugging  
me. I've learned my lesson on why not to use nightlies on a  
production site, but I want to fix this. I know that I have two  
options as it is: move back to 2.0.5 (database changes don't permit  
this, from what people have been telling me) or find an answer to why  
this is wrong.

Any help or even a point in the right direction would be really  
helpful to me.

Thanks,
Anthony.

It depends upon how many sites you eliminate from the user base because the
generic/popular hosts have only updated to the last release of 4.0.  A worst
case scenario would be that WP releases a version that requires 4.1 and
quarter to half of the blogs out there attempt an upgrade that fails, all
because one routine in a key area is the only routine in the entire core
that uses sub-queries.

I haven't joined this conversation to any degree, because it seems that we
are arguing from a vacuum.  How can anyone answer whether or not it is safe
to upgrade until someone provides proof that a roll out of 4.1 based WP is
feasible.  Nobody has asking questions like "Who are the top 20 must popular
webhosts and what version of MySQL are they running?".  If everyone else has
upgraded and 1and1.com is the exception, then perhaps it should be
considered even if 1and1 is as big as they say they are.  I doubt 1and1 is
the sole exception.

> Is there a compelling reason to choose 4.0 over 4.1?
Not, in my mind, for WP 2.1.  Even if a sub-query allows some whiz bang
feature that could be thrown in at the last minute, the cost of all of the
sites that cannot upgrade, I suspect, would be too great.  And it's getting
pretty late in the game to start rewriting stuff to wrap it in "if version <
4.1" statements.

If a move is gonna be made, I think it should the decision should be made
before the design takes place.  Or, at least, before the majority of the
coding for the release takes place.  There certainly are a lot of things
that subqueries allow.  The best way to take advantage of that is to design
any new features around having that ability.  That is so much better than
retrofitting.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents...

That's more or less right. Normally, IE will ask if you want to download
the file, rather than trying to render it. IE will render
application/xhtml+xml as though it were tag soup if you include a XML
processing instruction and use the .html extension. But going to such
lengths to serving document format to browsers that don't support them
in lieu of nearly equivalent formats that they support much better seems
rather pointless. Indeed, /no/ browser has better handling of
application/xhtml+xml than it does of HTML 4.01 strict, with the
singular exception of the Flying Saucer sample browser, which of
course /only/ handles XHTML markup.

This is why HTML 4.01 Strict is the simple option. But a mechanism for
transformation is more future-proofed.

I don't know how to determine the most popular hosts, but
Wordpress.org recommends [1] the following hosts, which according to
their sites use the listed version of MySQL:

- Bluehost: 4.1
- AN Hosting: [can't find]
- Yahoo: 4.1.12
- Dreamhost: 5.0
- Laughing Squid: 4.1.2

By the way, I have a number of sites on a budget host that still uses
3.23, so we're going to cause a disruption to some people anyways.

Aren't there advantages to announcing the minimum version *before*
including features that require it?  It would give people time to make
the db change before errors start appearing.

Could take another look at this one as well, although i see it was 
recently bumped to 2.2. But it has the potential for making a significant 
difference in some cases.
