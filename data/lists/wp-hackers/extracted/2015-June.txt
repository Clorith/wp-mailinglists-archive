Subject: [wp-hackers] XML-RPC POST attack
Message-ID: <556C9443.7010308@gmail.com>

Hi,

I found many ideas how to protect website from XML-RPC attacks (POST hits).
They suggest .htaccess protection, using filter, delete file, use special security plugin, ban IP 
address, etc.
But I want to use this protocol on my website and wanted to ask if there is any way to protect 
XML-RPC from Ddos attacks directly on server side (Apache)?
I am searching for something which can be usable for many different websites on one server.
I do not want to allow only specific IP address, etc.
Do you have any working solution?

Thank you very much for ideas!

Pavel

I suggest you use an oriented anti DDoS service, such as Incapsula.com, we provide protections from XML-RPC attacks.
It would be much trickier to implement your own protections without stopping or disrupting the service.

I would agree with Or Wilder, but if you want to do it yourself I recommend
blocking via iptables if possible. Here's a write-up of how I do it:

Hi ?

There used to be a simple setting within the Admin to change the uploads directory, but it?s gone in current versions of WP.  So how are we supposed to do this, officially?

I see that there?s a constant that can be set, but that method appears to be frowned upon by TPtB.

Generally speaking, you should not change the uploads directory. The
user-facing settings were removed because users were constantly changing
them incorrectly, and thus, instantly breaking their uploads because they
don't understand how web hosting works.

But if you do know what you're doing, then you can edit them directly in
the database. The options are still there and still used, there's just no
easy interface to change them. They're in the options table,
named upload_path and upload_url_path.

There is also the hidden /wp-admin/options.php screen where you can edit
all the options directly. Be careful with that one.

Message-ID: <CAFnKAk10gv6Qd66p4sG5nnGNz3aniPpDwfKPwif9cEU+9Kqotw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all,

I had noticed something odd in the documentation for wp_get_image_editor -
while it says "This function is the main function that you use when you
want to edit an image by url", the example doesn't give a url as the
parameter. Why is a url expected instead of a local file path?

It seems odd that it expects url and fetches them, as local file is more
efficient and less likely to be blocked. Any specific reason it is built
this way?

Best regards,
Luke

Subject: [wp-hackers] $wpdb->prefix
Message-ID: <CAHERW=24cQ6_ZfFkMH-H+mwqbq1v4mhbwPG4A1vp=0fyvtZ7vg@mail.gmail.com>

I installed 2 WordPress sites but pointed the 2nd WordPress install to the
1st one's database. Since I used a different table prefix for the 2nd one,
everything works.

This results that  I got 2 set of WordPress tables in the same database
while the 2nd one uses just a different wpdb prefix.

The question is...

How can I use the get_posts() ( or WP_Query for that matter) to query to
1st WordPress's posts from the 2nd one?

Is there an argument that I can pass to the get_posts or to WP_query to
tell the WP to use a different prefix than the current installs
wpdb->prefix default?


Ideally, this ios what I'm looking for;

$args = array(
'db_prefix' => 'xyz',
'posts_per_page' => -1,
);

Is there something like the 'db_prefix' above ?

Sounds to me like you should host both sites in a multisite instance.

Don't believe a word the codex tells you. If you want the truth, go to the source. (I'm exaggerating slightly. ;-)

The docs for the function don't even mention the word URL: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_image_editor/

The name of the parameter is even $path. So of course it accepts a local file path. But it does accept URLs too: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_image_editor_gd/load/

Feel free to update the codex to clarify this. :-)

Depending on what you are doing, you might not want or need multisite. In that case, this should work:



$old_prefix = $wpdb->set_prefix( $site_1_prefix );

// get posts, etc., here.

$wpdb->set_prefix( $old_prefix );



See wpdb::set_prefix(): https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wpdb/set_prefix/

This method isn't without it's difficulties, because of caching and 
globals and the like.

You could attempt to mimic WordPress' switch_to_bog() adapted for a 
non-multisite instance. E.g. flush cache, reinitialise use roles etc. 
This would involve flushing the cache completely 
($wp_object_cache->switch_to_blog()) won't work here because you're not 
in a multisite environment).

But I'm not convinced it would be plain sailing from there either :).

Depending on what is required, simply reading the first site's RSS feed 
and rendering that might the most straightforward solution.

Actually using wpdb->get_results could have just done the job for me ( but
I need a more complex SQL that a simple one as follows )

 $SQL = "
    SELECT other_prefix_posts.*
    FROM other_prefix_posts
    WHERE ( other_prefix_posts.ID < 10 )
    AND other_prefix_posts.post_status = 'publish'
    AND other_prefix_posts.post_type = 'post'
    ORDER BY other_prefix_posts.post_date DESC
 ";

 $posts = $wpdb->get_results($querystr, OBJECT);

This won't cut my need cause I need post_tags and category terms sprinkled
over this SQL & that's where the buck stops.

you would apply a join

here are a few examples in here.

Yes you can apply a few joins.

The database structure is fairly easily set up. I believe you need to do 
two joins to marry the terms with the term_taxonomy (terms contains the 
name and the slug, term_taxonomy the description and the 
term_taxonomy_id (which is usually the same) which is then used in the 
...) and the term_relationships.

In term_relationships you find the taxonomy_id coupled to post_ids 
(object_id).

So your JOIN will be something of the kind that:

SELECT ... FROM ... AS p JOIN prefix_term_relationships AS r ON p.ID = 
r.object_id JOIN prefix_term_taxonomy AS tax ON r.term_taxonomy_id = 
tax.term_taxonomy_id JOIN prefix_terms AS term ON tax.term_id = term.term_ID

That's three.

In your statement you then have access to term.slug (for example) or 
tax.taxonomy (to differentiate tags and categories).

You can probably write this nicer with

SELECT ... FROM ... AS p JOIN (prefix_term_relationships AS, 
prefix_term_taxonomy AS tax, prefix_terms AS term) ON (r ON p.ID = 
r.object_id AND r.term_taxonomy_id = tax.term_taxonomy_id AND 
tax.term_id = term.term_ID)

If you need extra material from the other tables, apart from just a 
WHERE check, you may need to make an inner statement:

SELECT .., ..., .. FROM ( ... )

but I'm not sure about that, I'm sure you can just supply:

SELECT p.ID, term.slug FROM ..... JOIN ( .... ) ON ( ... )

Good luck.

Bart.

Slight error in this SQL:


SELECT ... FROM ... AS p JOIN (prefix_term_relationships AS, 
prefix_term_taxonomy AS tax, prefix_terms AS term) ON (p.ID = 
r.object_id AND r.term_taxonomy_id = tax.term_taxonomy_id AND 
tax.term_id = term.term_ID)


Fixed.
