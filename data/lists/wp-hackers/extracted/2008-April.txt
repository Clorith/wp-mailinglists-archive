Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugins -- new header fields: max-compatible and
	min-compatible
Message-ID: <326B9662-A288-40BB-AFFF-005529370BAA@striderweb.com>

Hi All --

As I'm going through the process of upgrading to 2.5, I'm looking at a  
loooong list of plugins.  I'd updated some of them, but after a while  
I get confused as to which I've already done and which don't have new  
versions.

Here's a thought.  It might be useful to allow for new plugin header  
fields: "max-compatible" and "min-compatible".  It would allow plugin  
developers to specify WP versions that the plugin is known to work with.

For example: Ozh's Admin Drop Down Menu v1.3 works with WordPress  
2.3.3 and lower only.  For WP 2.5 you need the new plugin v 2.0.1.  If  
Ozh had the maxes and mins specified, WordPress could actually  
_prevent_ me from activating the lower version in WP 2.5, and prevent  
me from activating the higher version in WP 2.3.3.

The specifics need a bit more fleshing out, as we should have a  
distinction between a "hard limit" such as the example above, and a  
"soft limit" of "I just haven't tested it with any version newer".

Perhaps with a "soft limit" WordPress could simply give a caution to  
the admin upon activation: "This hasn't been tested with this version  
of WordPress.  Do you want to activate it anyway?"

We could also add some sort of iconic statement (green/yellow/red  
dot?) in the Plugins list in WP Admin, so that just looking at the  
list you could quickly know the status of any given plugin.

Of course, for plugins lacking the headers, they would act as they  
always have.

So, what do y'all think?

Stephen

 the Automattic WordPress Tests?
Message-ID: <47F19348.50107@santosj.name>

I don't want to step out of line with a statement I was going to make on 
my blog, but seriously how many core developers which commit patches 
actually test it with the Automattic WordPress Tests [1]?

How many contributors have the Subversion checkout of the Automattic 
WordPress Tests and run it with patches?

I think by doing so, it would be more feasible for some of those 
developers to write test cases for their functions and prove their 
patches are a success. I'm seeing some do this already, however, you can 
never have enough doing this.

You can also see the results run two minutes past the hour, every hour 
at http://wptests.dragonu.net.

I wonder if they really care that the WP.org top navigation section 
looks like crap on 800x600 resolution? Probably not.... ah well.

Out of all the caching proposals I've seen for the Summer of Code, this is
certainly the best (no offense anyone, I had one in there as well). I would
love to see what could come out of this with a whole summer to work on it.

Hi All

I am wondering whether it is possible to automatically assign classes
to images within the new gallery function in 2.5 please? The idea
being to assign a class say imglge to the first uploaded image and
then say imgsm to the next four and then style them accordingly. Or
even automatically add a class like lightbox to include that function.
If it is not possible would it be possible to add a field where the
class could be added on upload please?

I believe that's basically how the Zend framework handles caching.
You give every cached object a unique identifier along with a bunch of
tags.  That way you invalidate entries based on the ID or on any of
the tags.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [GSOC 08] Asking for help with proposal ideas....
Message-ID: <82041d760803312354y6c22e165of9c1d4d295bcb2cc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi I'm a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology who is very
interested in working for the wordpress community through Google Summer of
Code this summer. I wanted to ask you all what you think about my first
proposed project (I plan to propose 2) and also which of the other projects
im considering proposing you think would be most valuable.

my google summer of code application blog:

http://williamharris.name/gsoc2008/

feel free to make comments and give me feed back on it. That would be
greatly appreciated :)

Abstract:
Proposal 1 (which I've already submitted but would like feedback to help
with)
It would be interesting to build a system to encourage people who submit
bugs and participate in discussion about Wordpress code related issues by
providing them with a rewards system. This could lead to helping developers
identify who is most interested in working with them on their projects, who
is most actively contributing, what their strengths are, and more. Since the
Wordpress community already uses the trac (http://trac.wordpress.org/)
project management system to manage its codebase the most effective way to
give this functionality to the community could be an extension to the trac
environment.

This project proposes to develop this system using best methods based on
research.

full post about it:
http://williamharris.name/gsoc2008/2008/03/29/proposal-1/

other things I'm considering making proposals on:

XHTML validation framework, which helps ensure that all output of WP
(including templates) produces valid HTML
Extending the search system to support more advanced search syntax,
relevance, and external APIs like Google or Yahoo's.

also on the Wordpress GSOC google group
http://groups.google.com/group/wordpress-soc-2008/browse_thread/thread/bf9f7d3f753816a9/07e9218f3ddcc574?hl=en#07e9218f3ddcc574

Lloyd Budd made what I thought was a great idea of proposing number of
smaller projects to work on seeing as there are alot of little things that
would be good to get done around Wordpress but that are too small to scope
for an entire summer.

does anyone have any suggestions about that?

Thank you,
William Harris

Lightbox is added via the anchor attribute, so that would probably going 
within the image.php template like <a href="#" rel="lightbox"><img 
src="#" alt="#" /></a>

He definitely wasn't the only one. :) I've given it some thought too and was
trying to find a way around all of the string compares while allowing the
fine tooth references to clear the individual post's cache rather than all
of them.  For example the periodic saves of a draft post you are writing
shouldn't clear the cache of your currently dugg articles.  A properly
indexed attribute table might provide better results than string based tag
arrays on the cache objects. That would allow a btree to do the work but
would shift the resource usage around again if in a much more limited way.

Before more people start doing this we need some documentation -- how
to write/run their tests. Here is a short Codex article:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Automated_Testing

The page contains the instructions from Alex's readme and some more
command-line options for wp-test.php. It could have been expanded to
include information about knownWPBug method, _WPMediumBlog class and
its friends, but I didn't have the inspiration to complete it :-)

Great work there! I found some differences between your test results
and these on my computer, but I will contact you with more details
when I investigate the issue.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Ditto. Proposal:

On plugin deactivation, call null_shortcode($tag). This adds $tag to
an array stored in options table.

On add_shortcode, check for $tag in null_shortcode array. If found,
remove it and update_option.

On do_shortcode, replace tags in null_shortcode array with empty string.

In my experience, most newer sites aren't being designed to fit in 800 
width, but there should be a scrollbar when it doesn't fit, not a 
complete mangling.. right?

simple. elegant. reversible.  +1 for me.

another way to proceed would be leave the whole content as a comment,  
instead of replacing with an empty string. just my 0.1 cent added :-)

I'll be not many.

Andy, I can see how implementing this for a system with no caching already present would address a lot of issues and would be really great. But I didn't really get from reading your post what this system would help do that the current WP Object Cache doesn't already make possible?

Besides making it easy for plugin authors, etc. to use the caching system without having to add a hook to invalidate each on action xxxx, that is. The current object caching model can easily address this by adding "pseudo-actions" that act as groups and are triggered each time one of the sub-actions are fired.

Maybe you could explain the other benefits of a tagging-based system vs. the current implementation?

However, I wonder how many people, with the 1280 x 1024 or larger  
screens, like to have multiple non-overlapping windows open at the  
same time. In general, I browse with Safari as small as possible.  
This OneStat is a good example of a website that is too wide.

How would we know which plugin adds which tag?  i.e. how do we  
automatically queue up the deactivation hook to remove the tag?

We don't. The plugin would have to call this on its own deactivation.

Alan, you shouldn't forget that Mac Users are "different" from windows users
- especially when it comes to "Full Screen Windows".
Nearly 100% of win users use fullscreen mode. I think this is because the
top menu of mac os is allways on top of screen, while it is on top of the
window for windows users, but that doesn't matter. They just do not use
"windows".

Of course there are some who use window mode. Of course others do it
sometimes. But just like mac users those people aren't the majority.
Yes, we all should take them seriously and keep them in mind when designing
for web. But to your question: Not too many - I am pretty sure about that.

I am tech-savvy for sure, but I use windows full screen mode most of the
time. No matter what I do - coding, browsing, grafics, whatever (yes, where
it makes sense I switch that). Most time I concentrate on one app and this
one fits the whole screen - it is even hard to have a skype chat open at the
right of the main window. As I said before this may be because I will not
find the menu and the buttons were they'd be otherwise, maybe its just that
I am used to have full screen windows. But for sure most windows users are
used to do it this way. Just let some statistic tools keep track on window
sizes, they all report the same - most window-sizes are those which equal
resolution-minus-taskbar, I recorded this about a year ago and this is not
likely to change within one year.

Again: I am not talking about power-users nor mac users but normal users,
which normally "work" on MS Win and if you are really lucky are browsing
with firefox instead of IE.

just my 2 cents
Alex

Another option would be to have wordpress automatically strip out any
unhandled short tags as the final step before rendering.  Would lead
to a performance hit though.

I don't generally use fullscreen mode, unless forced to by some overly- 
ambitions web site.

I _especially_ don't use fullscreen if I'm using multiple programs at  
once, which is frequently.

Not trying to start a "which is better" holy war -- just calling out a  
suspiciously convenient "statistic" that sounds a lot like wishful  
thinking.

Remember: 67% of all statistics are made up on the spot.  ;)

The current implementation has a delete function for deleting
individual items and a flush function for flushing the entire cache.
It does not provide any method for flushing groups, though this would
be a trivial patch. Even so, groups are a one-to-many structure.

The versioned tag-based cache enables many-to-many grouping and
instant mass extinction of related items. There is no need to scan an
index to find the related keys because simply incrementing the tag
version makes all related items unreachable.

This does not translate directly into better performance for
WordPress. All it does is provide fine-grained control over related
items in a persistent cache.

I do not support switching WordPress to a versioned tag-based cache.
Extensive modifications would be required to see any benefit from
that. I hope the concept can be proven without that monumental effort.

The GSOC proposal from Thomas is huge but informed and inspired. I
expect it to trim down after an examination of goals vs. time.

Tested in IE, FireFox, Opera and Safari for Win.

I do not say this would be a good solution, but this are the right entities
if you'd like to encode this stuff.

But anyway stipping something off which was entered by the user by purpose
is no good idea.

I don't ........ yet.

It is on my todo list to get this setup so that I can run the test suite
against patches.

It is also my intent to push for test cases before committing when
people want to change the behaviour of complex code - autop for example.

I already have a number of useful scripts I use to increase my
productivity when reviewing patches (which I must share sometime) and
adding one which allows me to run all the (relevant) test cases against
a patch is where I would like to be :-)

Some questions for those of you more up-to-speed with the test cases.

What are the prerequists to getting the tests up and running over and
above what WordPress itself requires?

How long do the tests take to run?

Not to anyone specific of course, but... I've been using this lower 
resolution since I first started getting online and having a computer in 
general. I've been used to this 800x600 resolution for YEARS... and 
anything above  that just gets blurry to me.

When I do up WordPress themes, I like to code for this resolution, 
mainly because it's the resolution I choose to use and like, compared to 
other ones... The email wasn't to start a resolution setting war, it was 
just to let them know that it looks borked in my 800x600 resolution... 
and I was thinking that something should be fixed "code wise" so it 
looks nice and pretty in ALL resolutions, not just higher ones...

I know most people like to code their stuff for viewing in Drive-In 
movie screens, but believe it or not I have never been to a drive-in 
movie, and I really don't want to have to have stuff "Forced" on me to 
view it at something of that resolution(s)... Email was just merely to 
say and show how it looked... and someone found the issue, reported back 
with a possible solution... It's up to whoever to make necessary changes 
in order for it to be "right" or "fixed"... apparently it's not top 
priority, so it's cool.

That will work well except when the content is exported from one blog 
and imported in another/new installation. The array with the old 
shortcodes wouldn't be in the new db.

I still think that the format for shortcodes should be hidden in the 
browser by default, like the <!--more--> and <!--nextpage--> tags that 
have been working very well for some years now.

There are several options to show any type of shortcodes in TinyMCE, it 
supports custom tags, or the "wordpress" plugin can be extended to 
handle them similar to the <!--more--> tag, or we can modify and add the 
"bbcode" plugin for TinyMCE, etc.

"67% of all statistics are made up on the spot."
Yeah, sure. And your're of course right - the real percentage of windows
users with full screen will more likly be around 80 or so... I only wanted
to say that it will most likely be more "Full-Screeners"
than Alan woud think.

Maybe this "full screen" mentality is only common in germany... don't know.

I have to admit: I do not know one single person using a mac with apps at
fullscreen mode (does mac support it? I think they do, but I do not know,
since never saw it in use ;-)

"Not trying to start a "which is better" holy war"
Neighter would I - I use both, which ever I think fits better to the
situation and I think everyone can decide this on his/her own,as this
doesn't afect others.

@Mr. Awesome - you have my full respect, and I mean it! I'd die having to
use 800x600.

~75% Alex (the rest of me is allready thinking bout the code of my new
plugin... here your stats are - for sure - faked maybe mine are too;-)

No, it's the norm among Windows users for non-utility apps (Office, browsers) here as well.  There are of course exceptions, but based on my experiences user-testing consumer software I believe they tend to fall into the rarer "power user" category.

For example, if the shortcode format is <!--[shortcode]--> or
<!--[shortcode ...]...[/shortcode]-->, in TinyMCE we can easily filter 
<!--[ to <pre>[ (or any other tag) on input and filter it back to <!--[ 
on saving/switching to HTML mode. It can also be filtered to 
&lt;!--[shortcode]--&gt; and back to <!--[shortcode]-->, etc.

The standard <![CDATA[ ... ]]> can also be used.

That way the shortcodes will be editable both in Visual and HTML modes 
and could be pasted, typed, etc.

Someone deactivates a plugin, their shortcodes are nulled. That's
going to be a rare occurrence. If they then move and the nulled
shortcodes appear again, I am willing to let that happen in that case.
Almost all options are lost in a move. It's not hard to copy an option
manually or write a plugin to null an unused shortcode.

Another plugin idea: retroactively convert certain shortcodes to their
HTML and save this in post_content. That would let you disable a
shortcode plugin without losing previously-saved content.

The way I wrote the Quiz plugin, it never stores the shortcode in
post_content. To ensure the shortcode containing the question and
secret answer never appear on the blog, it strips out the shortcode
and stores it in postmeta. In this case it doesn't matter that the
shortcode's position in the post is lost. It is added to the end of
post_content when filtered to edit, then stripped out again when
filtered to save.

It's a bit late for this IMO. The format has been around for years and
in trunk for months.

But then some plugins will clean up their shortcodes when they're  
gone, and others won't.

<!--[shortcode]--> would have been nice, because it is self-cleaning.   
But it's probably too late to change it.  So let's not cry over  
spilled milk.

Here's my idea:

We keep an array of added shortcodes in the options table:  
installed_shortcodes.  add_shortcode() will check this array, and  
update it as necessary (first time a shortcode plugin is run, for  
example).  But it will also keep an array of shortcodes in memory.

in do_shortcodes(), we compare the option with the in-memory list of  
shortcodes.  If a plugin is deactivated, it'll be in the  
"installed_shortcodes" option, but *not* in the in-memory array.  We  
can then easily strip out these shortcodes from the content.

Sidenote: we'd need to strip <p>\[$shortcode( .*?\]|\])</p> out, for  
shortcodes entered on their own line.

So, it is basically you checkout the SVN repository, add your test suite
apply the patch, and then run the CLI file in the Automattic WordPress
Tests repository.

I was able to do that in several minutes. Give or take modifying the CLI
to work with the web, which was a two weekend project.

Hooray! I think the intent should be on only committing code which has
documentation (even if it is from a core commit member) and has a test
case. It'll be a pain, so I do think it should be a recommendation until
which time more contributors are comfortable with it. I say that from how
much I originally fought such a requirement, but the only reason I did it
was because I really wanted to work on the project.

I'm not sure if I would work on WordPress, because it is not as fun as
game development (but somehow holds my interest better than game
development, so figure that out for me).

Yeah, you are looking for a Continuous Integration package. There is
Bitten, which probably isn't intelligent enough at this moment and there
is phpUnderControl, which uses CruiseControl. The Automattic WordPress
Tests do not currently do that and my tool does not do that. With as many
tests that could be when all of the functions are tested, it will be an
excellent idea to do that in the future.

I'm currently looking at Continuous Integration packages, which are free
and wouldn't be difficult to do for WordPress.

Automattic WordPress Tests
Linux (PHP 5.3 for Windows)
PHPUnit, might need an older version if using PHP4.
PHP4 or PHP5 with the current version of PHPUnit.

WPTests @ http://wptests.dragonu.net
Web Server
PDO_SQLite
PHP5.1+
Add yourself to Allowed Hosts in the .htaccess file.

WPTests is actually sort of a continuous integration like system, but not,
so it isn't meant to do much of what another project will allow you to do.
It is meant to just be on a web server and hit with a cron job or
scheduled script and go to once in a while to see the results.


> How long do the tests take to run?

Just go to the web site and it will tell you. It is off by a minute, which
I plan on fixing, but the PHPUnit results will tell you.

It is anywhere (on my host) from 2 minutes to 7 minutes. On my machine it
usually takes the same amount of time.

Do you by any chance have a patch to allow us windows users to run the  
tests?

until PHP 5.3 comes out, in its current form it doesnt support windows,  
And i've not had the time(or want) to hack it up to run as expected.

Whoa! I wasn't even aware that this testing suite existed. I'll start
using it to test my patches before I ask for them to be committed.

http://wordpress.svn.dragonu.net/WPTests - Subversion checkout

Run patch_cron.php, which will patch the wp-cron.php file in your
wordpress folder.

There is a test that will fail. You can either hack
run-tests/wordpress.php in order to set the Test Known bugs to false, or
you can go to that test case and type

$this->markTestSkipped();

Once the issues are fixed and no fatal errors are occurring, then go to
run-tests/wordpress.php in your browser or CLI and wait until it is
finished.

You will need PHP5.1 and PDO SQLite extension enabled.

Then check the index. It would be better to have run-tests/wordpress.php
in a browser or tab on its own so you can keep hitting it.

PHP 5.3 should be coming out very soon.

For reference, Heres a slight change i made to allow me to run it under  
windows and still access the cli args. only works for short args, and  
ignores optional args(Which isnt a problem for the wp-test.php file anyway)
Added this to the start of wp-test.php:

set_time_limit(0);
var_dump( ini_get('max_execution_time') );
if( ! function_exists('getopt') ){
	function getopt($short=''){
		$opts = array();
		$params = explode(':', $short);
		for($i=1; $i < count($_SERVER['argv']); $i++){
			if( in_array(ltrim($_SERVER['argv'][$i], '-'), $params) ){
				if( isset($_SERVER['argv'][$i+1]) && $_SERVER['argv'][$i+1]{0} != '-'  
){
					$opts[ ltrim($_SERVER['argv'][$i], '-') ] = $_SERVER['argv'][$i+1];
				} else {
					$opts[ ltrim($_SERVER['argv'][$i], '-') ] = false;
				}
			}
		}
		return $opts;
	}
}
(Next line is: $opts = getopt('v:t:r:sf'); )

However, I cant override the 60second execution time it seems(and dont  
feel like changing the php.ini as endless loops are anoying), it still  
kills the script after 60 seconds no matter what, So looks like i'll give  
it another miss until php 5.3 comes out.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Actions dependent on locale cannot be loaded in a
	plugin
Message-ID: <919282.56599.qm@web52912.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi!


I've run into a problem when updating one of my plugins (More Fields). The action: 


add_action('load-' . sanitize_title(__('Settings')) . '_more-fields', 'mf_queue_js');


changes depending on the locale, i.e. the translation of 'settings', but when the plugin is loaded and the action is added, __('Settings') does get translated, but remains 'Settings' and so I'm calling an action which does not exist. 


I understand from http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4563 that this was possible back in 2.2. Has the point at which the locale is loaded changed?


How can I access locale-dependent actions in my plugin?


Any thoughts appreciated,
Cheers,
Henrik.

Perhaps it is too late, although there are hardly any plugins at the 
moment that use shortcodes, and there will probably be lots of them in a 
few months. There are quite a few that use the "old" shortcode format 
too, like <!--plugin's special tag-->.

It's easy to use the current format in core, where the function that 
replaces the shortcode will always be present. But supporting plugins 
that use it brings some complications, especially for this type of 
shortcodes:

[shortcode foo="bar"]
content
...
more content
[/shortcode]

where the content is different from post to post.

Yes, something like that will have to be added to both js and php 
versions of wpautop. It will also have to support the above shortcode 
format too and treat it as <pre> tag, not changing anything inside.

If hooks are being run with translated names, It seems pretty stupid IMHO.

However, If you want to make sure the textdomain has been loaded at the  
time, Try adding your actions on the init hook, I think that runs after  
the translatable stuff has been loaded and setup.

Check out http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6444

The diffs there (both of them) cause formatting to treat [] as <>, and 
skip over them.  Although, that's not really the focus of the ticket.  
It main purpose is to either move processing of shortCodes to AFTER post 
processing is done (priority 11), or allow them to work before OR after 
(priority 9 or 11).

Correct.

Everything related to languages should be done at init or later, so
that everything is loaded and any plugins that modify the content are
loaded.

Users can already do this easily, with copy and paste code from the  
search giants. But a boost in relevancy wouldn't hurt. Lucene is a  
nice choice for that, and keeps the index on the the same server,  
instead of relying on a 3rd party.

Here's an example of a php solution:

I don't think that's an edge case worth worrying about. It's unlikely 
that someone will use a shortcode a non-trivial amount of times and then 
delete it and uninstall its plugin. If they wanted they could search for 
it pretty easily.

Yeh, I agree, it is confusing with locale dependent actions - the existence of which is easily overlooked when developing plugins on an English WP installation. I was tearing my hair out trying to figure out why the JS was absent on a sv_SE (Swedish) installation. 

Thanks for the help - that worked! And for completion, the action is:

add_action('load-' . sanitize_title(__('Settings')) . '_page_more-fields', 'mf_queue_js')

and nothing else.

Cheers,
Henrik.

I upgraded to 2.5 and uploaded the theme I'd found on wp.com ... Andreas04.
The upgrade was not only painless but fast, too.
With the new theme activated I went to Presentation / Widgets.
Of course it wasn't there.

I located "Manage" ...
... haaa! Great April Fool's Day joke!

Instead of seeing both sidebars like on .com Presentation huh huh ...
... dealing with widgets in 2 sidebars, seeing only 1 sidebar at a time.

That's hilarious ... such a classic regression in function!

And not being able to access the default widgets? That's a great touch.

bdt

p.s. a bit over the line, though: the theme is glorious on .com and the 
sidebars are all tumbled in 2.5 ...
... are you going to do a release for April 2?

I agree with the sentiment. The widget functionality has become more
powerful, but less intuitive. Not a major issue by any means because
widgets are mostly set-and-forget, but it was an interesting switch
from <2.3.

That is fascinating! I had that exact some problem and it about drove me 
crazy with my damn host. I was sure that it had to of been something in 
the Automattic WordPress Tests, but it doesn't.

Surprisingly, the problem fixed itself, so my host gets the chance to 
live. I don't know, try setting the max limit to 200 and see what 
happens. Probably has nothing.

To be honest, I really think my host was killing processes which were 
active for longer than a minute, because I finally was able to get PHP 
to install and still had the problem. Now, if you install PHP yourself 
and can change the PHP.ini, then it should be assumed that the values in 
php.ini would work (and they did, except that one area.

I'll go for violence myself and willing to hold a torch for you, but I'm 
actually just kidding. However, before you go crazy, well, I don't konw, 
they were never able to tell me what the issue was, but it works now.

It would probably be better if Alex would look for $argc and $argv and 
use those instead in the CLI environment.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Let's make Buttonsnap fully obsolete
Message-ID: <8f93a7390804012214k27e3dbd7t5f3aac3f2c278127@mail.gmail.com>

For those who don't know, Buttonsnap is a PHP class that allows for super
easy adding of buttons to the non-RTE editor and used to allow for adding
buttons to TinyMCE as well.

Source:
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/vipers-video-quicktags/trunk/resources/buttonsnap.php

Buttonsnap was made partially obsolete with WordPress 2.1 which forced us
plugin authors to write full fledged TinyMCE plugins to add buttons. (No
complaints from me really, just stating the facts).

I propose we make it fully obsolete by introducing an API into the core for
adding (and even modifying?) the buttons in the non-RTE. I know TinyMCE is
the "preferred" editor of choice these days, but I absolutely hate the thing
and I don't think everyone else uses it. Not to mention there's still the
"HTML" aka Code tab that even TinyMCE users have access to.

One solution would be to do quicktags.js -> quicktags.js.php and make it
dynamically generated (i.e. hooks and filters), but then we may run into
caching issues (although no-cache headers would fix that). Another solution
would be one similar to how Buttonsnap works and just manually add buttons
to the container.

Any thoughts on this? Anyone else actually think it's a good idea?

I for one would love to have to stop bundling Buttonsnap with my plugins.
It's a great class, but it's time for it to retire and take it easy in the
code retirement home.

Damn dude, why did you think I made my tool?

Use http://wordpress.svn.dragonu.net, which works with apache and php. 
It requires two fixes to get running. Also it will need you to access 
the run-tests/wordpress.php from 127.0.0.1 or you can add another 
allowable host to the .htaccess in the run-tests directory.

I think that would be really pretty cool.

First option (quicktag.js.php) gives two options:
- external <script src="quicktag.js.php"> :
This means that both the Write page and the quicktag file will require 
wp-config.php, which will double all the SQL queries and plugin loading 
and stuff.
- inline quicktag javascript: 
wp-config.php is included only once, but it adds nearly 10kb to the Write 
page.

I think the second option is better. Thoughts?

Keeping it a .js file allows it to be cached in the browser and various 
network caches, so after the first loading it is a lot faster.

Perhaps it can be extended a bit by adding a js hook for additional 
buttons. These buttons could be either in inline js or separate js files.

Theres no reason why a php file couldnt be cached correctly too.

That sounds like a good compromise to me,

A external js file is queued up, And inline js is printed out to the write  
page, on document load, the inline js is used as teh config for the  
external static functions.

It could, but it's a bit tricky. The web server sees everything coming 
from php as dynamic content, so it doesn't do any cache control on it.

All cache control has to be done from php, the headers Last-Modified 
/If-Modified-Since and Etag/If-None-Match have to be checked and set, 
etc. This works well on Apache, but not good on IIS or Litespeed, where 
php can't access the headers sent by the browser. Even getallheaders() 
was renamed to apache_request_headers() in php 4.3.0.

This isn't a solution per se, but you could wrap your functions in
!function_exists() to suppress the error messages:

        if (!function_exists('similar_posts')) :
        function similar_posts() {
          // blah blah
        }
        endif;

Subject: [wp-hackers] Rename plugin directory name
Message-ID: <47F35D1E.4030400@elektroelch.de>

Hello,

for some reasons I've changed  the name for my plugin directory from 
"pagebar" to "pagebar2". This was no problem until the new "automatic 
update" feature, since it creates the "wrong" (old) directory.

Is there any possibility to rename the repository on the WP-server?

Thanks
Latz

Thanks for the question Lutz.  I as well have the same question.  I
would like to rename my plugin called (currently) "Persistent Styles
Plugin" to "Persistent Styles".

I guess this entire problem is coming up as you're hard-coding a plugin  
foldername into your plugin files?

Ideally a function is needed to return information about the current  
plugin IMO.

Here is some code i've used before to determine the folder WP is installed  
in: $folder = dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__));
(That code is off the top of my head, but should be allright)

In a smilar fashion, theres a trac ticket for adding plugin_url to return  
something like http://.../wp-content/plugins/my-plugin-folder/

It should be simple enough to simply change the plugin name in the .php  
and readme.txt files, but you'd retain the same slug(ie. it'd still be  
persistent-styles-plugin, yet called "Persistant Styles").

Its possible to get the folders changed though, just required a  
wp-plugins.org admin to do it though i think.

I've used a similar function in my plugin for some time and it worked on 
almost all installations but some seemed to have difficulties with this 
code so it was not fully satisfactory and I switched back to a hard 
coded folder name.

Such a function would be really helpful (if it works in all/most 
situations possible). Well the milestone set to 2.7 so it's gonna take 
some time...

I'm afraid that's true. Still I would appreciate the possibility to 
change the name by myself. I think there are quite a few authors who 
want to change the name of their plugins over the time.

At least I'm happy to see that I'm not the only one struggling with this 
issue.

I was having problems with getting the base name so I went for the
fool-proof way:

	`function get_base(){
   		 return end(explode('/',
str_replace(array('\\','/pluginsfilename.php'),array('/',''),__FILE__)));
	}`

I haven't had a problem since.

I agree, I'm stuck with ajaxd-wordpress instead of ajaxed-wordpress,
and now I can't even change it because of links to the former.

Nothing, they are completely separate issues. In wp-cron.php it has 
require('./wp-config.php'); So it will want wp-config.php to exist in 
the run-tests folder when it gets to that test. The other one is 
basically, forcing the skipping of a test case, which the function does 
not exist. Both will result in a fatal error and bring down the rest of 
the execution.

I'm working on getting the second issue fixed, but I have a patch for 
the first. Just run patch_cron.php in the root checkout and it will 
"fix" wp-cron.php for you.

I have a plugin that passes parameters from the database to a  
static .js file.

The way I do it is to use PHP to write a JS function call into the  
page header with the parameters in the call.  It works quite well.

Pretty straightforward, but you can see it here:

Message-ID: <47F3B672.8040900@gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering, after setting my WP language to Dutch (nl) why it
doesn't switch the dates and time accordingly. Am I overlooking
something or would this be a nice addition to Wordpress?

Hello,

I just propose this... I am waiting feedbacks


WPES (WP External Storage)  is project that will allow bloggers to use other
kind of storage for upload files (images, videos, audio) with an easy
integration WP.

The planed build-in drivers are the Amazon S3, FTP, Picasa (for pictures),
YouTube (for videos), also another important part is define an API to add in
the future other storage.

It will be as the WP upload box, but instead of upload files to the server
it will do to another storage, then when it is upload it will generate the
HTML and XML (rss and atom) to integrate it with the entry. This will be
possible with the great PHP Stream Abstraction available since PHP 4.3.2.

The greater benefit is that WP user will be able to have podcast and their
video or audio will be hosted on other server, really useful to offload
traffic of blogs with huge audience.

Another utility is the backup of files, useful for don't lose data or "easy"
migration of hosting, because the files will be on another server restore it
(or link it) is easy.

You are correct.  

To quote the Zend developer zone:
<blockquote>
In a real-world application you are likely to have several pieces of
information which are cached for every operation. You will want to be able
to manage these pieces of cached data as a group and not have to worry about
remembering all the ids of your saved data.

To handle this, Zend_Cache has implemented a tagging system. In Zend's
tagging system you can tag each cache entry with multiple tags, and unlike
the IDs, tags do not have to be unique. This means that you will have
multiple cache entries using the same tag, and are able to manage these as a
group. The tags are specified as an optional parameter to the save() method.

As an example:
<?php ... $userdata = array("theme" => "green"); $cache->save($time, 'time',
array('instance')); $cache->save($date, 'date', array('instance'));
$cache->save($userdata, 'user', array('user')); ...
$cache->clean(Zend_Cache::CLEANING_MODE_MATCHING_TAG, array('instance'));
echo $cache->get('user'); ?> 

Here we are creating several entries into our cache system, but are using
tags to separate them into logical groups. We have a group for our date/time
information, and then a group that stores the specific user information. We
are going to use the clean() method to force the removal of the instance
data, but will retain the userdata for future use.

You will notice the use of a class constant in the above example. Zend
Framework has set a standard of using class constants (using the 'const'
construct) instead of global constants (using define()) whenever possible,
this keeps the global constant space clean.

Tags are only available in the file-based backend drivers.
</blockquote>

The string compares urk me, in all of these tag implementations.

I like it.  Firefox has a similar concept for it's extensions.  I  
think it should be a soft limit but should be very visual so that  
people know what's going on.  However it shouldn't be so bad that  
someone will have a heart attack if they upgrade Wordpress.

And you'll be able to show on a page what shortcodes once were used  
but are no longer and include some management functions like:
  * null out shortcodes
  * place shortcodes in comments (so they can be found again and  
reactivated on a case by case basis)
  * Upgrade shortcodes from one version to another or even to a new  
plugin.

Maybe the name of the plugin that defined them, so that plugin foo  
won't accidentally start using plugin bar's frotz shortcode?

Great! I didn't know about those in the readme.txt standard!

What we're asking for is notification in admin interface, so that the  
user knows.  In fact, I like Requires at least and Tested up to.  
Better names than min and max.

"Requires at least" should be a hard-coded limit.  It just won't  
activate if WP is less than that version.
"Tested up to" should indicate it's untested visually somehow yet  
still run.

Message-ID: <47F3E9A8.6080306@xavisys.com>

I talked about it a little in a recent post 
(http://xavisys.com/wordpress-25-first-impressions/), but one of the 
most annoying things of 2.5 is that when you insert an image as "full 
size" it isn't full size at all.  It has a max width of 500px, unless 
you have set $content_width in your themes functions.php file (a global 
that, as far as I know, has not been used before, and does not exist is 
the vast majority of themes)!  If you want thumbnail, medium, and large, 
then call it that, but still give us a full size option.  I added my 
opinion to the tickets as well (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5777 
and http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6086), but I'm sure I'm not the 
only one that feels this way.  Should I submit a ticket to put it back?  
Or am I in the minority?

Yeah a max width of 500px seems odd to enforce upon all 2.5 users. I agree
with Aaron. Let's have a full size option.

Actually, that's what happens when you CHOOSE the "full size" option. 
It's quite misleading. I think it should be renamed and a true full size 
option added, or it should be modified to be a true full size option.

I understand the reason for it, and adding a
$_GLOBALS['custom_width']=1234 to your theme's functions.php file is
not a major obstacle for most users... Inserting a picture and having
your whole theme muck up is a far more commonplace problem.

However, I'd far prefer this to be a CSS thing instead of it inserting
an actual width value into the post content itself. Since we're giving
the theme control of the width, we should do it the proper way: by
assigning images in the posts into a class and then letting the theme
control that class.

If you're going to do it, do it right.

It DOES give full size images a class  of "size-full" which, in my 
opinion, should be enough.  There shouldn't be a need to ALSO limit the 
size by adding a width and height to the image that is less than the 
actual width/height.

A super-common problem we found was people uploading images and 
inserting the full-size into the WYSIWYG. What happens? Try it on 2.3 
with a 6 megapixel image from your camera. To get it back so your window 
works you have to scroll waaaaay down and right and resize it smaller 
bit by bit.

Doesn't it seem like they should then use the medium option?  Or the the 
image properties button and change the sizes?  Or upload a smaller image 
(I know, some people don't know how)?  Or at the very least that we 
should then call that option "large" since it's not full size?

I understand the though process behind it, and I can even see the need 
(for some people...many of whom run WordPress), but it seems like it's 
currently misleading, and a LOT of themes out there do not have the fix 
implemented (because it didn't exist until recently).

	data bits
Message-ID: <9837D3A1-70F3-46CE-97BF-A8F32CC0D237@tekartist.org>

Hey all,

I'm having to store static data for a plugin. To put it in context,  
people can choose to embed the data from an API as dynamic (live api  
or wp_cache lookup at page load) or as static (ie: snapshot in time of  
an api record).

The usual practice is to have a custom table in the wp db (like  
Twitter tools et al.), but I'm wondering what would happen during WP  
upgrades and migrations.

Is the WP export / import scripts be taking these in consideration  
when people are moving hosts, or will the tables be left behind? If  
the latter, is the import/export tool hookable so we can instruct it  
to also import/export our custom tables?

I could lookup the code, but I also have another related question:  
Instead of having a custom table, and since the objects will be rather  
lightweight, would it be a really bad idea to store them in wp_options  
instead?!?
They'll all have a unique key, and I only need to query them one at a  
time (ie, no search, lists, etc).

I'm just wondering if the wp_options avenue would lead to a global  
slow down of the wp install in the long term, since the table is one  
of the most accessed.


Thanks for your feedback,

Note on the zend framework lucene example: they rewrote lucene in  
php5, they're not integrating with lucene.

Extra but not entirey releveant (unless through a plugin): for a super  
lightweight and crazy fast sql indexer and search solution, sphinx is  
a wonderful product: http://www.sphinxsearch.com/

I think this could happen, because every page load calls
wp_load_alloptions, which puts all options into the object cache.  If
the options table is huge, this might max out the PHP's memory.

Christian gave two good reasons;

1) When upgrading I don't have to slog through source files looking  
for what's going to work and what's not.

2) With hard limits, WordPress can programatically _not_ activate any  
plugins that are known not to work with that version.  The Drop Down  
Admin Menu plugin is a good example.  There is a version that flatly  
**will not work** in WordPress 2.5.  if we had these limits  
implemented, WordPress could know not to activate.  Same with the  
later version that _only_ works with 2.5

Yes, plugin authors can put in logic that tests for versions, but this  
would be a standard one-line header.  It could alert the user directly  
that there is (or may be) an issue.

 From another angle: What significant benefit do one-click plugin  
updates have over uploading files via FTP?  Simple:  less screwing  
around with source files.

>>> "Requires at least" should be a hard-coded limit.  It just won't  
>>> activate if WP is less than that version.

You're probably right on that one.  The "tested up to" should also  
probably only flag it if it's a significant decimal -- e.g if it's  
tested on v2.3, it should _not_ flag 2.3.3 as untested, but 2.5 yes.

Argh, now that I spent all that time integratiing with it and TinyMCE  
2 and 3?!? :p

Kidding, it's a great idea.

Still gonna mean one more thing to support for plugins who want to be  
backward compatible, but it's a good decision for the future, methinks.

That only gets the options with the autoload column set to "yes".
Other options are only pulled into the cache on an as needed basis.

But autoload is "yes" by default.  So, plugin authors using the
options table for mass data would need to specify that it be off.

On the backwards compatibility front, I'm actually seriously considering
just dropping pre-2.5 support for all of my plugins. Users are welcome to
use older versions of my plugins, but the amount of duplicate code is
getting rediculous.

For example, in my Video Quicktags plugin, I have to add buttons THREE
different ways -- one for WordPress 2.0, one for TinyMCE 2, and one for
TinyMCE 3. Then for the BBCode (aka shortags), if I want to switch to using
the much easier and more robust shortags API in 2.5, I'd still have to
maintain the old regex code for previous versions.

It's kinda like once you start coding for PHP5 and using the new features,
it's hard to keep supporting PHP4 (although I will as that's not nearly as
bad).

Which is best for 99% of cases I think. For the plugin authors that know
they are storing large amounts of data in the options table, they can
manually turn it off.

Hello list

I have been getting large numbers of accesses from large numbers of 
addresses lately, all posing as Internet Explorer 6. From what I've seen 
in the audit logs, they seem to be trackback spam. Many (most?) don't 
get past mod_security, and I still saw some 12k accesses with 11k 
uniques in stattraq yesterday (it's a little past midnight here).

Nothing got past Akismet, which is really cool, but it does make me 
wonder: is this an attempt to swamp the Akismet servers? Have those of 
you that have many thousands/tens of thousands of real visitors per day 
seen such an increase, or it only applies to low traffic sites like mine?

Seeing as how Akismet handles many tens of million spams a day (21 million
so far today), I doubt one could swamp the Akismet servers that easily and
especially with such a small amount of hits.

Just curious, but, while having Spam Karma2+Akismet and Bad Behavior 
running at the same time, could there be this many spammers listed in 
the CJD Spam Nuke Manager... and these being from just the last couple 
of days... Is there a main database to add these to, if possible? This 
is NOT counting the other ones that I've managed to collect and find 
from the net either though...

how about millions of blogs using akismet and suddenly getting ~20 times 
more traffic? I didn't plot anything yet, but I think the numbers rose 
geometrically (about doubled each day).

I was more curious if this is a new thing, or just a plain old botnet 
being repurposed from mail spamming to link spamming

Actually they implemented a binary compatible index and query parser

vs. the java implementation.

Thanks for the feedback guys. It's, as usual, greatly appreciated.  
Without laying it too thick, it's close to reason #1 why I like  
developing for WP so. :)

So we agree it's not such a bad idea, so long as:
1) I keep the "data sets" relatively small (for table size)
2) I manually set the autoload column off (4th param on add_ and  
update_option()).

If so, t's pretty much the best case scenario for me.

Cheers, and back I dive in my code. :)
I'd show it, but the API it integrates with isn't live yet. :p
Soon, soon enough.

I found that the text input box was extremely close to the widget above.

Is this a theme problem (Andreas03)? If so, please ignore / forgive.
But I see the same problem on wordpress.com (Andreas04)

I fixed it by finding search in core and adding a non-break space 
wrapped with <h4>, then duplicating a bit of the CSS.
Ugly as sin, yes ... totally ... and it worked like a charm. (I code. I 
don't claim to program.)

still trying to find my way around

Yup same feeling here, but I think I'll wait for 2.6 to stop  
supporting versions prior to 2.5.

Ok - since it seams hiding formerly used shortcodes will not be an issue wp
core will handle - if I understood Matt right on this topic -
I've written a (very) small plugin which can handle an (theoretically)
unlimited amout of user entered shortcodes and will
send this shortcodes to hell, nirvana, dev/null - whatever you like best.
It also has the option to leave the content of the shortcodes untouched.

It was written at about 2-3 am, so don't blame me too much if it isn't
perfect now ;-)

I would be perfectly happy if some of you would try it and let me know if it
fits your needs/whishes, if you found any bugs or stuff I should do better.
Grab your copy here:
http://blog.netgra.de/null_shortcodes.zip

You may set your shortcodes to be deleted in Settings => Null Shortys.
You only got one field and one checkbox at the very beginning - with every
code you add and save you'll get one more. I do not expect people to enter
10 shortcodes at a time - the case to need this functionality should be rare
enough.
Enter the shortcode into the field (for a shortcode of
[foo]content[/foo] you enter foo)
If you want to strip of the contents check the checkbox.
To delete a shortcode from the list just blank out the input field (and hit
save button).
Thats it.

Of course this will *not* do this dynamically when plugins are deactivated
but I think this will do exactly what a user would expect, after he entered
the shortcodes into the plugins list.

In that case, WordPress should automatically offer to deactivate
untested plugins before starting the upgrade.

Thats not really possible, The upgrade proceedure is to upload the new  
files, and then continue on working, The upgrade functionality only makes  
any needed changes to the database.
No plugins are touched, they're just loaded as usual.

So its possible post-upgrade when all the plugins are loaded to offer to  
deactivate any which have not been tested to work OK, but its kind of  
pointless at that stage.
It would be possible to give a message "Warning: Several plugins which you  
have active have not been tested with this version of wordpress, please  
check they work OK", its not really needed, after an upgrade, checking  
plugins is usually one of the first things.

I was getting so much Trackback spam today that it DOS'd my server.   
Even putting a "die()" in the top of wp-trackback.php didn't bring the  
load down.  But hey, as they say, don't get mad, get even!

RewriteRule ^(.*?)/trackback/?$ http://127.0.0.1/ [L,R=302] //  
translation: go #$%& yourself

Ha!  And almost immediately load went down from 60 to 0.5  Gotta love  
trackback bots that'll follow a redirect back in their face.

Setting your locale doesn't mean you have moved to the Netherlands. We
have Dutch users all over the world and forcing a timezone for them
wouldn't be a pleasant experience.

On install time WordPress will try to guess the GMT offset from your
server date, so if your server has proper local time you won't have to
change anything.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

That's the way I'm going with all my plugins needing an update for 2.5

Anyway I think plugin authors should always code for the latest and
drop support for deprecated WP versions.

Sadly, 2.0.x is still technically supported.

Luckily, we plugin authors can do as well please and it's the user's own
fault if they don't want to update. :)

A hardlimit to top isn't really a good idea I think.

First - als DD32 mentioned - you are able to upgrade wordpress without
deactivating plugins (isn't recommended but *is* possible however)

Second:
If I write a plugin today it will - of course - support 2.5. It would not be
too smart to write a plugin only for outdated versions.
It may or may not support 2.6 - how should I know when I release this
version of the plugin, which upcomming versions of wordpress will be
supported? This values are not subject to change after the files are
downloaded by the user. Before downloading the user should read what is
written on that download page and there should be written that it doesn't
support WP Version XY if the Plugin Author knows.

You know: If a user is told that plugins will not work with his version of
WP this is a good thing - if he belives Plugins will work until he gets this
message telling him it won't this is bad. Bad because no one can predict
until which version his plugin will work and so they will not fill this
value or will fill it with a value which doesn't make any sense. The "Tested
up to" - soft limit would be gread to show up in the backend however. Same
with the hardlimit "requires Version XY or higher".

Something alike was added with 2.5 already.

Why not just use the so called "media buttons"?
This Media Buttons Stuff is pretty cool, extendable and can be used with
tiny and code view (don't know which editor your're using, viper, could I
like that one more than code view? Do the media buttons work?).

I think Media Buttons are made in a good and pretty way. Maybe this would
need some extra css to make it break and extend when there are more Buttons
than fitting in the line, which may happen, when plugin authors get used to
the power of the media buttons ;-) but until then some time will pass by.

I am creating a new media button with my (still unreleased, since I realised
I should add multi user//multi account support before publishing it) Flickr
Plugin. It works like charm! Better than every tiny mce plugin stuff - and
it will (maybe) work for a longer time period since it sould work with every
editor *and* this one works with code view too.

Hi Nikolay,

Thanks, but that is not what I meant.

I was referring to the localisation of the date and time in text. In
other words:

Friday the 13th

becomes:

Vrijdag de 13e

I have switched languages to NL and installed the appropriate language
file. The admin interface is in Dutch so that works perfectly. I changed
the time / date format in the options, yet in the theme the date and
times are displayed in English. Anyway, after a good night sleep I had
another look at the theme and it was using the English suffix of the
date() function format options. Removed it et viola, it solved my issues.

met vriendelijke groet,
Bjorn Wijers

Because those are for media. What about contact form plugins for example
that create a button to insert their placeholder into a post. It wouldn't be
bad though for my Video Quicktags plugin though. May have to try that.

In general though, that's a really poor solution as not all plugins would
want their buttons up there.

I don't use anything custom, just the classic editor. (Profile -> untick
rich editor)

Message-ID: <3283f0830804030617u16f297a0mb4baef15d4c8df89@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I've written several private plugins that add form fields to the write/edit
post screen and process the data when the post is saved or published.
I don't feel like I'm doing this properly though. Does anybody know where I
can read up on how to properly add form fields and process them?

It would be great if there was something equivalent to the explanation of
properly adding an options page in the wiki (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Options_Pages)
If that doesn't exist though, any documentation you know of would be helpful
(even the code from an existing plugin that does it well).

It might be helpful to mention that I'm saving data from these fields in the
postmeta table.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <de7267ff0804030626v2c312559n4b6fb1ef19fff5d2@mail.gmail.com>

Dear WP Community,

I'm a final year Computer Science student, and very very interested in
joining GSoC 2008 to work for Wordpress. Actually, I have submitted my
application under this account.

However, the project I'm proposing is out of the ideas list, hence I would
really appreciate it if you don't mind to guide me here :)

This idea has actually been around for some time in my mind, as I've been
developing several Wordpress sites and been looking for these
functionalities, however I haven't been able to find them anywhere..

So this would be a plugin to boost user-interactivity of a Wordpress blog.
The fact is, blogging now isn't only a matter of speaking one's mind up.
Many that started from personal blogs have grown into huge, vibrant
communities with loyal, regular visitors. Part of this phenomenon should be
attributed to the easy to use, easy to maintain properties of Wordpress.

The objective of what is proposed here is enabling a blog to be even more
interactive, visitor-oriented, attractive to their visitors
...all achieved under the very warmth of WordPress platform.

This will be accomplished by two major functionalities: enabling
user-generated content submission via site's front end and user point /
reward scheme that promotes user's engagement.

I found some people have requested this on the WP Ideas page, and there was
also one guy who experimented by hacking comment core here:
cantwaitforchristmas.com for the sake of this function, so hopefully many
people would be happy with the presence of something like this.

I was planning to make these one integrated plugin, however it came to me
that maybe it's better to separate them and into 2 projects, so that each
can have more in-depth functionalities?

I would like to ask your opinion on the scope.. would 2 systems under one
roof be too much?
And if it's better to turn it into 2 plugins, may I know which one would you
think would be more beneficial for the community?

Thank you very much,
I'm really hoping to hearing from you all! :)

We could offer a warning to the user if the photo is over 2MP (or 1280
wide, or...), if they choose "I meant to do that" it's displayed full-
size, if they choose "Oops" it gets resized as usual.

I think this is a really good idea.  I like the idea of it having its own
plugin system so that it is easily extendible.  Drop and go.  More
complexity could allow the option of specifying the file type or size used
by that file system.  Then you can have files over 20mb go to S3 or
something like that, unless it is a mpg which gets sent to YouTube.

I think that giving to theme auther a method to let WP know what's the
maximun size for pict in content area is a good idea, would be better
if this will be called max size so we will have 4 dimension:

thumbnails for gallery etc
medium size for images larger maybe with flowing text around
max size for images that are wide as the content
fullsize, for origina image dimension that will show up as image in a
single page or lightbox and clones etc

Max size if present sould be showed as info for the corrent theme in
the same page where you set up thumbnails and medium dimensions.

Thisul would be IMHO the right way to name things and the logil use
for them

Just my 2 cents

Is there no other way to only show it as a different size in the
WYSIWYG then? Maybe a different style on it in the admin window
somehow, or some kind of clever javascript?

This plugin has always done a simple but good job for me. As far as I
can tell it still works with 2.5

Message-ID: <C69D081D-CBDC-4639-9FD4-1CDBBDF381EE@tekartist.org>

Hey all,

There's a nasty discrepancy between the core codebase and the codex in  
regards to the update_option() function.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_option

In the above docs, the advertised params are :
- $name
- $value
- $description
- $autoload

But in the code (wp-includes/functions.php), the specs actually are  
update_option($option_name, $newvalue)

The main issue with this is that (as far as I know), everybody uses  
update_option over add_option, since the docs (and code) states:
"This function can be called even if the option does not exist, the  
function will create the option. ".

It's an immediate issue for me that gonna be a big drag, because I now  
need to check if the option exists, then use add or update, since I  
need to set the autoload flag.
Not the end of the world, but I thought I'd mention it before editing  
the codex page.

Is there something I'm missing?!?

Stephane

That also mean one cannot use update_option() to switch the state of  
the autoload flag when needed.

Yes.

You should use add_option, while you are installing, unless of course the
option is dynamic. When you are updating, you should use update_option.

In order to figure out whether or not you should update, you should use
get_option to retrieve the option and test whether it is false, then
either install or upgrade, if needed.

Proper plugin development techniques should be expressed on the codex to
prevent errors on the part of the developers (not all of whom are complete
idiots, I do really stupid crap too, don't get me started, I have a long
list I just shake my head at).

Back on topic, there has been a patch made to "correct" this issue,
however it seems partially human error and developers to blame. I think
developers were spoiled off of add_posts() and update_posts(), not all
code works that way, nor should all code work that way.

Also on topic, this is the exact reason why you don't put documentation
that belongs inline in a developer manual setting. When you make a change
inline, you see the documentation there and can update it. Knowing where
it is on the codex is or even if it is on the codex is tedious.

I will suggest just creating a patch which adds phpdoc to that function in
the source and just give examples of usage on the codex page.

That plugin looks like it has been dead in the water 9 months, by my
count.

In 2.5, there is a better way: the add_meta_box function.

A different outfit has been working on re-invigorating Custom Write  
Panel along with some other plugins together in another plugin called  
Fresh Post. Haven't tested in 2.5 myself, but it worked well in 2.3.  
Still in beta, of course...

Yes, but I've already given a good example of this.  The developer of  
the Drop Down Admin Menu could add the "max" header to his older  
version of the plugin when he realizes that it will not work with  
newer versions.  (Both <2.5 and >2.5 versions are available to  
download.)  Won't help people who already have it, but will help users  
of older versions of WordPress who download the older version.

I'm not _married_ to the hard limits options (and in any case, it  
would be an option between hard/soft), but it does have a certain  
usefulness.

The soft upper limit and the hard lower limit would be useful,  
however. :)

If one wants to take it to this extend it may be fine to have both "tested
up to" (soft) "breaks above" (hard)...

However I fear people will not belive a plugin may not work in a version, if
there is no message while other plugins would create such messages...

If a plugin author wants to stop things breaking - well... one could allways
try to add his add_filter, add_action, add_shortcode stuff in an if
statement checking the WP version to be less/higher than... this should
work, however I have not tried it now. One could also add an else which adds
the admin panel (if the plugin uses one) which will inform the user about
the version requirements.

One could also add an init action triggered when the plugin is installed
which could query a server to get to know the working versions and add this
into the db to check them as mentioned above. I would prefere this because
you do not need to update your readme.txt and it may also work with already
installed plugins - of course then one would have to think about a way to
query this on a regular basis without slowing down wordpress at every page
load.

This would also add the ability to remove shortcodes from the output
whenever the plugin doesn't work with the installed version any more,
without haveing to deinstall it - when the plugin is updated the shortcodes
will be rendered again.

Just found this: <http://ninjamonkeys.co.za/has_tag-wordpress-plugin/>
Basically, a plugin that adds an has_tag() function

I had never tried but if asked I would have thought this was already a
built-in function. Shouldn't this go core?

That is a handy function. I'd like to see that in core, provided it's
made a little more flexible (like returning true if there's any tag
when nothing is passed to the function, and maybe checking tags by id
or slug).

For the record the 'Custom field GUI' plugin has been dead for
probably years now, but is extremely basic and continues to work in
all situations where I need persistent custom fields. Its ugly and
dumb but works despite it's zombieishness (partially I think because
it's agnostic about the different UI wrapper functions ;)

>From what I can tell the 'Custom Write Panel' was never finished and
is totally dead, and the dev moved on to work on that Fresh Post
thing, which seems to have a lot of potential but was ~alpha last time
I tried it (Haven't tried it lately, it might be living up to it's
premise if there are new versions, it seems very useful).

Mindshare: If you want the old plugin (rc_custom_field_gui) on pages
as well you can just add one line to the main plugin file. Just look
for the add_action hooks and add this at the bottom:

That's nice work, Otto. It does exactly what I'd expect.

I can see one potential issue though, and this may be splitting hairs.
Should there be a way to distinguish a numeric tag slug from a tag id?
Examples: the number 666 might be a tag people use in discussions of
occultism and the number 42 might be a tag used by Douglas Adams fans.

Should there be a way to identify the type of identifier the function
should be looking for? I'm not advocating that, as it would probably
be pretty uncommon, but it may be worth discussing.

Hello Fara,

Thanks for your application and your interest in WordPress!

I?m personally mentoring ?under the hood? in areas of performance and load testing, but here?s my two cents regarding the questions you asked.

In my opinion, the two features you bring up are strongly tied together, in a synergistic kind of way. Both features together under one roof (so to speak) bring a far-different picture than the two features as separate plugins. I don't see why you'd have to sacrifice functionality in order to put them together (unless you're referring to time constraints), and keeping them together as one plugin also lets you do all kinds of nifty integrations and other neat tricks.

Please note that I'm not endorsing the actual addition of such user-generated/interactive features to the WordPress project, I'm just answering the questions you've posed to the community ;-)

So I'm curious.  In the 2.5 release you guys axed file-depending
caching (and that's good) [1].  The question then is what role does a
plugin such as WP [Super] Cache play in this since it is file-
dependent?

Well, the existing functions like is_category and such don't do that.
So they would have the same problem.

However, the existing functions in 2.5 also allow you to input arrays
of things, so I figured that was worth adding as well. If you give
this one an array of tags, has_tag will return true if any of them
match.

Note that if you added the third parameter of "true" to the "in_array"
functions below, then the strict checking mode would prevent the issue
you're concerned about with it mixing up id's and slugs.

/**
 * has_tag() - Check if the current post has the given tag
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Taxonomy
 * @since 2.5.1
 *
 * @uses wp_get_object_terms() Gets the tags.
 *
 * @param string|int|array $tag Optional. The tag name/id/slug or
array of them to check for
 * @return bool True if the current post has the given tag, or any
tag, if no tag specified
 */
function has_tag($tag = '') {
	global $post;
	$taxonomy = "post_tag";

	if ( !in_the_loop() ) return false; // in-the-loop function

	$post_id = (int) $post->ID;

	$terms = get_object_term_cache($post_id, $taxonomy);
	if (empty($terms))
	       	$terms = wp_get_object_terms($post_id, $taxonomy);

	if (empty($tag)) return (!empty($terms));
	
	$tag = (array) $tag;
	
	foreach($terms as $term) {
		if ( in_array( $term->term_id, $tag ) )
			return true;
		elseif ( in_array( $term->name, $tag ) )
			return true;
		elseif ( in_array( $term->slug, $tag ) )
			return true;		
	}

	return false;
}

None. WordPress Object Cache is wholly-independent from full-page HTML caching with WP-Cache and WP Super-Cache plugins.

Totally off-topic:

For the record the 'Custom field GUI' plugin has been dead for
probably years now, but is extremely basic and continues to work in
all situations where I need persistent custom fields. Its ugly and
dumb but works despite it's zombieishness (partially I think because
it's agnostic about the different UI wrapper functions ;)

>From what I can tell the 'Custom Write Panel' was never finished and
is totally dead, and the dev moved on to work on that Fresh Post
thing, which seems to have a lot of potential but was ~alpha last time
I tried it (Haven't tried it lately, it might be living up to it's
premise if there are new versions, it seems very useful).

Mindshare: If you want the old plugin (rc_custom_field_gui) on pages
as well you can just add one line to the main plugin file. Just look
for the add_action hooks and add this at the bottom:

    add_action( 'edit_page_form', array( 'rc_custom_field_gui', 'insert_gui' ) );

No, I like this one, and it can be done in a compatible way. Just make
the next version recognize <!--[shortcode]--> as equivalent to
[shortcode]. If somebody really complains about it, we'll tell them to
use the self-cleaning version of the shortcodes.

This should be just a straightforward addition to the regular
expression matching the shortcodes, no?

Hi

I would like to create a fully functional theme editor for wordpress
in GSoc. What do you all think about it?

 == Abstract ==

I aim to create a WYSIWYG theme creator/editor for Wordpress. On blogs
hosted on Wordpress, this editor will *NOT* allow direct editing of
code: instead, the user will use tools to create the required themes.
This will allow users to change/create themes without generating
invalid code. In the self-hosted version of wordpress, this editor
will be extended and will have an improved code editing version (with
code highlighting, tips, etc. etc.)

You can see the full proposal here:
http://kunal.byethost18.com/wordpress/?page_id=4

Eagerly waiting for suggestions, comments and feedback.

Thanks,
--

So the question remains whether a file-based caching system is even
necessary?  I ask this, because at work we instituted SQL dependent
caching in our ASP.NET app, and that methodology makes the most
sense.  It also apparently performs the best in terms of caching
options, while file-based is dead last.

It would be great if the business logic of WordPress went to a cache
allocation and asks: "has this record/table been updated?"  If not,
then retrieve it from cache and don't make a db query, if so then
expire cache and get new data.

File-based *object* caching is relatively slow, but full-page HTML caching (the request doesn't even reach the ASP interpreter) is fastest though highly inflexible.

That's what the object cache current does.
It stores the result of database queries, and if that result hasn't changed it'll retrieve it from the cache. If the result has been invalidated or has expired, it'll get the new data, cache it, and use it.

That sounds like a very good idea. Then we can add a small filter to 
TinyMCE to replace <!--[ (but not <!--[CDATA[) with [ on loading and put 
it back on saving, so the shortcodes can be typed or pasted in visual 
mode too.

Otto, are you going to make a ticket/patch? I can add the editor stuff.

On a related note, it seems that shortCodes are NOT parsed for feeds, is 
this intentional?

I'm working on a plugin and the options page has a large number of
checkboxes... any thoughts on what's the best way to group them together
with a select/deselect all function?

Thanks,

Sorry, that's JUST for RSS and RDF, for RSS2 and ATOM the shortCodes are 
handled.

Hey there,

I have a WordPress 2.5 install and I've just integrated bbPress, which is
installed into a '/forum/' directory.
When I visit '/forum/' the bbPress page opens fine, but when I open a thread
(/forum/topic/your-first-topic) I see a WordPress 404 error page.
How can I make WordPress ignore that '/forum'/ directory entirely?

Thanks!

First of all: I do not like WYSIWYG in any way. (Sorry, I had to drop that
line ;-)
*BUT* I think it is a great idea anyway.

I don't have to use it and thats good - others will use it and will - maybe
- create their own themes so we may leave the world of thousands of wp-blogs
which look exactly the same. I hate blogs that look the same. You follow a
link to a blog and it looks like one you allready visited. But it isn't
you'll  have to look at the domain to know this...

Ok so far for the idea itselfe. Here is something you may find usefull:

For a 'wysiwyg' thing it is hard to create very flexible layouts and stuff
by 'automatic-handwritten-code'. I do not say it isn't possible, but it is
tricky. Try one of the following css-frameworks, two of them already feature
a page-generator themselfe, so it's proven to work allready.
BluprintCSS (which features great typografic features)  -
http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/
YAML (Yet Another Multicolumn Layout - has its own "Generator" allready) -
http://www.yaml.de/en/
YUI Grids (from Yahoo User Interfaces - features its own builder too)
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/

For normal Themes I wouldn't recommed using them - I wrote a 21 pages long
scientific paper about css-frameworks and while doing that I found that they
are not sooo great if you want to build a theme by hand (exept Blueprint up
to some extend, because you would have to spend very long to create this
typo-effects) - but it may be a great help to use them for automatic
generation of themes. They allow enough flexibility and seem to be "easy" to
generate automatically. Generating all of this yourselfe will first of all
take time and second will result in another framework, with generator, which
wouldn't be better than relying on what is already there.

Just my 50cts
Alex

You should have 2 chances

Depending on server config it might help putting a htaccess file
into the folder forum which will handle the redirects in this folder.

You sould be able to modify the .htaccess
insert the following line before the 2 other rewrite conds:
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/forum

but be carefull with this - I do not know, how to tell wordpress not to
overwrite this, whenever you change your options.
I do this by making a chmod a-w on .htaccess after
editing so wp isn't able to write it anymore.

I have no experience with bbpress, but

RewriteRule ^forum/.* - [L]

before the wordpress-generated code should do the trick; and bbpress 
rewrites should work, too, since they are handled by forum/.htaccess 
(right?)

Ahh - that might work even better...
But I'd strip the last / - cause you will want this to work if one only
types example.org/forum instead of example.org/forum/

Two things:

1) When creating a new topic, you shouldn't reply to somebody else's  
unrelated email.  When people viewing emails as threads, your new  
topic will be lost at the bottom of the old topic.

2) RE Your question: it totally depends on context.  What are the  
fields?

Nicely done, but doesn't seem to work right.

I can't get anything to appear on the edit Page screen.  For Posts it  
works just fine.  Yes, I did hit the checkbox for edit pages.

Beyond that, this would be just perfect if I could also make a simple  
checkbox that fills a value of "true" or "false".  (Or if unchecked =  
nothing, I suppose "true" or "no such field" would work too...)

Nice plugin though.  I like the option to put things on the right  
toolbar. :)

Just put it outside the BEGIN WORDPRESS and END WORDPRESS comments.

I have a whole bunch of other stuff in my .htaccess and WP doesn't  
overwrite it.

hmmm . wordpress writes the RewriteEngine on inside that...
I allways wrote my rewrite rules behind this statement.
Thought this would be needed.
As you seam to be able to work with this without problem this seems not to
be needed - right?
Cool. Thanks.

Thanks for the replies everyone, but I can't seem to get it working!

I've tried the following setups as recommended:

RewriteRule ^forum/.* - [L]
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^forum/.* - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/forum
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

None of them do the trick. It's strange, becuase it works fine when I visit
the root bbPress directory '/forum/', it's everything after that in the URL
that doesn't work.

Since your using bbPress with Pretty Permalinks, I think your best bet is  
to add a .htaccess to the bbpress /forum/ folder.
That .htaccess should override the wordpress .htaccess a folder down:

So in /.htaccess:
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress

and then in /forum/.htaccess

# BEGIN bbPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /forum/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /forum/index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END bbPress
(Or whatever the bbPress recomended .htaccess is.


The result is that the web server should spot the .htaccess in the /forum/  
folder and use that instead of using the next folder it checks.
(ie. If its looking in /forum/site/something/ it looks for  
/forum/site/something/.htaccess, then /forum/site/.htaccess, then  
/forum/.htaccess, then /.htaccess)

That should work..

When you say you've integrated bbPress, are you just saying that they
share user data, or does bbPress actually include the WordPress files?

maybe you forget to setup the .htaccess of bbPress?

This one should have the content of
Options +MultiViews

OR if this doesn't work insert what you get shown when you visit
bb-admin/rewrite-rules.php

please let us know if this does work, when you rename the wordpress
.htaccess into something else (your blog will be broken until you change
this back)

Thanks everyone, it's working like a charm.
I put the wordpress .htaccess back as it should be, and created the
.htaccess for '/forum/'.
As Alex instructed I pasted the contents of bb-admin/rewrite-rules.php into
my new .htaccess file, and it's all working great now!

Thanks again,
Alex

Now, The reason why /forum/ works fine, is its a directory, You can see in  
the rules '!-f' & '!-d' that checks to see if the URL is NOT a file or  
folder. If its a file or folder then WP doesnt match it, and lets the  
server access the file/folder directly without cutting in.

WP-Super-Cache still has it's place, same as before 2.5. When a user visits
my site for example (www.finalgear.com), PHP is never touched. They're
directly served a gzipped .html file via mod_rewrite. The amount of CPU to
do that is incredibly minimal.

Compare that to a standard install like my personal blog and PHP has to
start up, check all files for parse errors, etc. (although this can be
disabled), fetch stuff from the database, generate the page, and then serve
it.

The differences are minimal when there's low traffic, but when you get a
huge spike and if you have a poor server, then you get in trouble.

How would one type in [foo] in the visual editor then, without it turning
into an HTML comment?

Personally, I think it's fine how it is and nothing should be changed
deactivation wise.

As Matt said, if you deactivate a plugin you've been using regularly, that's
your own business. It's gonna be rare that someone will use a plugin for a
long time then one day randomly get rid of it. A plugin can do a one-way
convert in the database on deactivation anyway if it's that horrible that
the shortcodes show up.

As for wrapping it in HTML comments, I'm not opposed to it being parsed by
WordPress just as long as the original is available. What if you wanted HTML
comments inside of the shortcode for example? Plus the post's source gets a
lot messier with HTML comments, especially since one is probably going to
never deactivate the plugin (see previous paragraph).


Summary: no complaints whatsoever about current trunk build, but no large
opposition to backwards compatible improvements either, just as long as they
don't bog down WordPress.

You're right. It would turn into a comment. It would be better to just 
replace the <!--[ and ]--> with &lt;!--[ and ]--&gt;. That would work fine.

However since this is a plugin related problem (or rather will be), 
logically a plugin should solve it. I've just made a small plugin to 
hide orphaned shortcodes. Give it a shortcode and it will insert an 
empty string in its place. Check it out here:

Since last night, I've reconsidered my opinion. I now think there shouldn't
be any modifications to current format.

Old codes can VERY easily replaced by blank strings as demonstrated by what
looks to be an excellent plugin by Andrew Ozz.

As for HTML comments, this just adds further complications to the code, can
cause problems with some shortcodes, and is unnecessary for 99.9% of people
as they won't be devactivating the plugins they use. For that 0.1%, Andrew
has you covered.

If it's not broken, let's not fix it.

Message-ID: <160203ed0804060751q6e245b42o5f7d0583855f3bc8@mail.gmail.com>

In the Settings -> Reading part of WordPress the first option is:
Front Page Displays:
    () Your latest posts
    () A static page
<http://www.the-pursuit.net/wp-admin/edit-pages.php>(select below)
        * Front Page: [drop down option of pages]
        * Post page: [drop down option of pages]

My question is: Is there a way to mimic this functionality? I am creating a
plugin and want people to have the option to choose which page this plugin
displays on - without requiring the user to put some <!--TAG_TAG--> into the
code of a static page.

Thanks,

Not sure what you're asking... If your question is "how do I add an
administration page for my plugin", read this:

No, I know how to add an administration page. What I am talking about is
trying to mimic the functionality seen on Settings -> Reading.

Thanks,

Here is some pseudo-code that should do what you want. All you have to
do is create a drop down list that you fill with page titles -- you
will want to clean the titles before using them -- and IDs. Later you
check to see if the current $id is the same as the one saved.

Aaron.

<?php
function admin(){
$pages = get_pages();

if ($_POST["mypage"]) {

update_option('page_id_plugin_should_display_on',$_POST["mypage"]);

}
?>

<form method="post">

<select name="mypage">
?>

<?php foreach($pages as $page){?>
<option value="<?php echo $page->ID"><?php echo $page->post_title;?></option>

<?php }?>
</select>

<input type="submit">
</form>

<?php
}

add_filter('the_content', filter);

function filter($content){
global $id;
$mypage = get_option('page_id_plugin_should_display_on');

if($id == $mypage){

$content .= 'Some cool feature';

}

return $content;

You can make your own URLs for your plugin-generated pages, if that is 
what you are asking. You will need to make a custom "Query Variable" 
and then a custom "Rewrite Rule". For info on how to do that, see the 
sections on "Custom Archives" and "Permalinks for Custom Archives" on 
this page:

Related to this, I've been trying to get something working in 2.5 that might
be broken (or I might be doing it wrong, in which case I'll take my lumps
and stand corrected).

If you set the Post page to, say, a page called "journal", then I can view
all my posts on this page, and paging works.

If I then set my permalink structure to include journal - which is something
I suspect most people would want to do if that was their post page - it
breaks paging on the journal page.

If the permalink structure and selected Post page are different (ie "blog"
as the permalink structure, and "journal" as the selected post page, all is
well.

I vaguely recall this being mentioned before, but I scanned the open tickets
and searched back through gmail and couldn't find anything.

Any ideas? Or care to link me to an open ticket (or a closed one, even).

Cheers.

Thanks Alex.

 I've been wondering about whether to create it as part of the core or
 as a plugin. I can basically think of 4 options:
 1) Full in core,
 2) Full plugin,
 3) The WYSIWYG editor as core and improved code editing as a plugin or
 4) Invert 3.

 What do you all think? Waiting for suggestions and comments too.

I would think this would be plugin material to begin with, but maybe later
down the road, when it's more refined it could be considered for core.

There will be a very long way for this to get into core. We saw what
happened with the new (great) media manager:
I think it wasn't just because of this, but WordPress Release was delayed
much, because so many huge changes were made.
Media Manager has prooven to be buggy under some conditions. But this
conditions seem to be given on so many sites that there are many complains
about it. I think it would have been better to put in the needed Hooks and
add the functionality via Plugin until it has prooven to be stable. There is
no use in complaining about this - but a mistake doesn't need to be made
more than once, so now this should be added as plugin - and if needed some
new hooks can be added to wordpress core to support this. This way you won't
harm the core and don't delay any releases. After the plugin has been
integraded into many blogs and does work stable it can be added to core
easily.

Message-ID: <485dd1460804061115x25f2b7faqcf04551ce4520f15@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Sometime back I was reading the codex page about creating new tables through
Plugin at http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Tables_with_Plugins and used
the sample code in my Plugins.

But now when I look at this page, I could see that their is a difference and
the file which is included is a different one. Earlier it was
wp-admin/upgrade-functions.php and now it is wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php

Was this change specific to WordPress 2.5?

Thanks!

If I remember, the change happened with 2.3

if ($wp_version >= '2.3') {
	require_once(ABSPATH.'/wp-admin/includes/admin.php');
} else {
	require_once(ABSPATH.'/wp-admin/admin-functions.php') ;
}

Something like this.

For some reason the data inside the widgets keeps disappearing in
2.5.  Not only that after saving it's not reflective on the page
itself even after disabling caching plugin, clearing browser cache,
etc.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Logging API - forgotten ticket
Message-ID: <47F995E7.1010602@santosj.name>

It is interesting to look back at patches you've created that never went 
in and probably never will, but here goes. If anyone is interested, 
ticket #5669, includes the proposal for a Logging API, which would allow 
for recording errors and placing them into a file or database for 
looking at later. This is mostly for people who are testing WordPress or 
their themes and plugins, so not something most people would care about.

The default is to print to the page, but only if WP_DEBUG is set to 
true. The patch probably needs to be cleaned up. I probably spent some 
time working on it to where when it displays, it doesn't suck, but I'm 
unsure whether or not I finished that.

It would be nice to hear whether this is something of interest and if 
so, whether anyone can test the patch to see what they like, what they 
don't like.

It might go into 2.6, since I'll have time to clean it up, but really it 
is up to the core developers and at this point the only interested party 
is me and I don't have commit access, so what I think doesn't really matter.

Actually, I'm not sure I like the current implementation, but I'm not 
sure what is exactly wrong about it. Really, it doesn't seem clean 
enough. Oh yeah, it also breaks the deactivation of plugins, which needs 
to be fixed. Interestly enough, it would be totally possible to find the 
plugin which caused the fatal error and then prevent it from bringing 
down the site again. Which would be a great feature, but currently not 
implemented.

I have experienced similar issue with my Plugins before.

After some debugging I found that this occurs if there is an error in the
function which executes when the Plugin is activated.

Jeremy,

When you try to use if (!function_exists) { ....} the error message will be
simply shown in the next function which is not wrapped with the
function_exists condition. This is kind of deceive behavior, but the actual
culprit is the error which has occurred in the code executed during
activation.

Hope this helps.

I had the same problem as Stephane, trying to open
siteurl/wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_config.php gave me the answer to the
problem (thank you Andrew :), the file was garbled (i.e. compressed). Using
phpinfo(), I found that my hosting provider per default is setting
output_handler = ob_gzhandler (in php.ini). Setting output_handler to
nothing (output_handler = ) and flushing browser cache fixed the problem.

Message-ID: <8F2376D7-F358-4650-9D5C-3F486A9D3A7E@randomnetworks.com>


Ticket 6612 ( http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6612 ) points to a  
blog post ( http://www.franzone.com/2007/07/30/wordpress-xml-rpc- 
patch-for-metweblog-newpost-method/ ) that details a problem with the  
dateCreated field in metaWeblog.newPost/editPost.

I was rather surprised to confirm this bug as detailed in the post.   
I figured if we'd had this problem for so long, one of the blog  
client authors would have complained about it before now :-)

I've attached a simple patch to the ticket that addresses this  
issue.  But date/time fields are particularly fragile in the current  
blog APIs, so I'd really like to get some feed back from folks in the  
field who have to deal with this before pressing forward.

Just for the record, I think a lot more than 0.1% of people have to
turn off plugins if only because they break as part of regular
WordPress core updates and the author isn't around or doesn't want to
fix them. Viper, I'm glad you're expressing so much commitment towards
your own plugins, but a lot of users don't know how to guess at which
devs are going to be around a long time and which are just making a
single release of something they built for themselves. I would also
posit that many users, presented with an annoying situation like ghost
tags from a disabled plugin, will just be annoyed rather than looking
for yet *another* plugin to fix the problem (which itself will someday
die, as all things do).

I have to admit I've lost the actual technical details being debated
here, but +1 for any solution that allows shortcodes to be used inside

I see both sides of the debate, but I think having to rely on another
plugin to clean up after other plugins is kind of weak.   Considering
wordpress already parses the short codes and replaces them with output
from the plugin, I think it's rather trivial to make Wordpress strip
out shortcodes that aren't used.  Make it an option in the admin panel
somewhere maybe.

I have definitely turned off many plugins, including one that added
markup (and I had that on enabled for at least 500 posts).  Thankfully
the markup was in HTML comment tags so I didn't have to worry about
it, but it would have been unrealistic for me to edit all those posts
manually.

One should integrate something like the
both existing plugins into wordpress.
I speak about the one from Andrew (which I haven't tested) and the one I
wrote myselfe and which is availeable there:
http://blog.netgra.de/null_shortcodes.zip
( http://blog.netgra.de/shortcodes-loeschen for those who understand
german).

Not much documentated by now anyway.

They won't be hard to integrate I think and it is better to give users the
possibility to decide which shortcodes should be ripped off than just
deleting content. No matter if you give them the option to turn it on or off
- maybe one has both: Death plugins AND handwritten stuff in [ and ] which
should stay readable.

Message-ID: <8f93a7390804080502p7beeb3edn8ae0220da01d091c@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to make  current_user_can( 'edit_dashboard' )  return TRUE for
all users without getting ugly and actually modifying roles.

"role_has_cap" seems to be the filter to do this, but I can't seem to get my
function that's been added to that hook to fire.

Any insight?

I posted this before but it has disappeared. If it shows up  - sorry.

 

Has anyone noticed that the automatic plugin update function isn't always
announcing plugin changes on the plugin page?. I've updated my plugin a few
times and purposely left my local copy  alone to see if I get notified  -
After a couple of days - no notification has arrived. I check the wp trac
and found ticket #6547 <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6547> . The ticket
explains that the name of plugin in the readme.txt  file has to match the
plugin header plugin name. I changed the readme.txt file plugin name to
match the plugin name in the header of the php file - committed and still no
notification. 

 

I don't know how accurate the information in the ticket is. Has anyone else
have any ideas?

Well, don't forget that your install will only check at most once every 12
hours.

Do you have an example of the plugin which your seeing it with?

Keep in mind that the wordpress.org details are only updated at a max of  
every 15 mins, and the plugins page only checks ~twice a day i think for  
new data.

I wanted to mention that I shortened the time in the wp_update_plugins
function to force it to request the latest plugin updates - I didn't
want to wait 12 hours.

I managed to hook into the capabilities with the 'user_has_cap' filter
(which afaik fires whenever 'current_user_can()' is invoked). I had to
trace the logic through a lot of hoops first though, so you might want
to look at the source for the place where it does the dashboard check
and follow from there. Here's a paste of the outline of my function:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Method to retrieve all posts/pages from a blog
Message-ID: <48190.62.116.129.3.1207666713.squirrel@webmail.nifelheim.info>

Hello all,

according the the coding-standards, one should better not attempt a direct
retrieval of data from the wordpress-database. With this in mind, I went
in search for a method retrieving all posts and pages of a blog. I found
get_posts(), but this method does not return a) only posts, no pages, and
b) not all either. The same applies for the pages.
In interest of compatibility, abstraction, and minimization of
database-requests, I would prefer a single method retrieving both, pages
and posts, of a blog - and -all-, not just a certain number, as
get_posts() does.

A bit of research showed me, as I wrote before, that such functionality
does not exist, yet. I think it would be wise to implement such a feature,
as for example the sitemap-plugins could stop attempting to harass the
database themselves. Instead they could use the appropriate function, and
with this stop the need to care about compatibility with future versions.
(In fact, the work on my own sitemap-plugin for wpmu lead me to this issue
;) ).

Thanks Ozh for the reply.

The correct code is

if ($wp_version >= '2.3') {
       require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
} else {
       require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-admin/upgrade-functions.php') ;
}

Something like this, perhaps...

function give_dash_edit($allcaps, $caps, $args) {
	$allcaps['edit_dashboard'] = true;
	return $allcaps;
}
add_filter('user_has_cap', 'give_dash_edit', 10, 3);

Did you try:
$allposts = get_posts(array(numberposts' => 0, 'post_type' => ''));

Looks like it should work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] The plug-in/ wordpress feature I need...
Message-ID: <7c10f5f30804081316x188a532fif47357884e3b6718@mail.gmail.com>

This might be the absolutely wrong place to vent on this one. I'm just
finishing up a site that makes heavy use of the tdo-tag-fixes plug-in to do
category/tag intersections. The database I'm attempting to build just would
not have worked if I hadn't been able to A) pull up a list of posts with a
given tag or tag interection within a given category... and keep users in
the appropriate template.

I'm using the awesome Fresh Post plug-in to create custom post writing pages
for each category.... I haven't yet started working with 2.5 to see about
re-creating my forms...

I am not a heavy php/wordpress plug-in programer... the heaviest I have
gotten is the example plug-in that lets you substitute a custom style sheet
for the Admin portion of 2.3... which is probably going to need some
tweaking for 2.5, I guess :)

I have hacked the tag.php template to display the correct custom fields
based on the given ... I even split to two different templates a regular
one, and a special one if the tag only occurs in one category... It's an
ugly hack... :) I've even applied the same if/else category detection to the
search template to a pretty good results, I might add.

SO...

I have tracked down a discussion or two about grouping tags into
tag-categories, and it sounded like there is some rudimentary calls for
doing this built into the database design for tags. I think I have a pretty
good understanding of how it could work... or how it would have to work
given the way tags are used by wordpress and stored in the database.

Am I the only one who wants to call a cloud or list of tags that belong to a
given group or class of tags, like "Cities" and/or "States", "functions"
and/or "System Calls" , "Bugs" and/or "Feature Requests"

I know i can include or exclude individual tags... but managing a growing
list of dynamic tags and bundles of them? ugh. With a small data set maybe,
with 500+ tags in four categories... not so manageable.

I call my plug-in metametameta... but I don't know jack squat about writing
that kind of code :) I'm more than willing to open a Google Code set-up and
write out my understanding and write a draft of a description of it... heck
I will support and document it!

Any pointers? Should I just suck it up and ask for bids on wp-pro-request?

I know there is a "feature request" bin somewhere on wordpress.com :) that's
my next stop!

Not until your eMail, thanks for pointing that out to me.

It did work, though while looking at the resulting array, I noticed that
this would mean a overhead of function-calls and most likely
database-accesses that won't really make up for the alleged advantage of
abstraction.
Especially for the case of sitemaps, one does not require the whole post,
only selected information (reduction of memory consumption), and not only
from the posts-table, but from the terms-table (for the categories) and
the user-table (for the names of the authors). A single sql-statement can
catch all that, whereas by using get_posts() would provide me with a
complete post without the category- and usernames. I would have to fetch
them manually, and that means at least two other sql-statements and
several function-calls.

Since this requirement is a bit special, I think it is better use direct
access through the $wpdb-object, with an appropriately crafted
sql-statement, and doing everything manually. It seems the more efficient
way for now.

Anyway, thanks for your help.

I was thinking it would be logically possible to add custom fields to
attachments since WordPress creates a new "post" for each attachment.
I can't seem to find a hook that would allow this though and I know the new
interface for attachments is flash. Is this even possible.

The reason I ask is I want to add a "order number" field to my uploads.
Currently I am using the caption/post_content field.

Thanks.

I'm referring to the ability to add another field to the uploaded file
attributes after uploads and to then process that data. This would be in the
same place one edits the File's name, caption, description.

Which hook are you using to add the plugin to TinyMCE? Also, is it 
TinyMCE 3 plugin? Have a look in 
/wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_config.php for available hooks.

Yeah, I traced the logic and came up with "role_had_cap". I must have missed
"user_has_cap" though.

Thanks guys. :)

Hello all,

I am running lighttpd + fastcgi + php5 (all current versions), and since
installing WordPress MU 1.3.3 (fresh installation), my error-logfile gets
a bit cluttered with the following message:

Undefined index:  HTTPS in .../wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_config.php
on line 47

It seems that $_SERVER['HTTPS'] is not set. I suggest to change the line
from the current simple

if ( $_SERVER['HTTPS'] == 'on' ) {

to

if ( isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && ($_SERVER['HTTPS'] == 'on' ) ) {

which would stop that annoying message while still keeping the intended
functionality.

Of course, since using WordPress MU instead of WordPress, I do not know
whether this is still an issue with the new 2.5-release. But since
WordPress MU 1.5 is not available, yet, this might help all those who
encounter the same problem.

My apologies. I just re-read what I wrote, and I see how you
misinterpreted me.

I meant to wrap _each_ function in its own function_exists() like this:

?        if (!function_exists('similar_posts')) :
        function similar_posts() {
          // blah blah
        }
        endif;

??        if (!function_exists('lolcats')) :
        function lolcats() {
          // can i has cheezburger?
        }
        endif;

??        if (!function_exists('secret_google_search_algorithm')) :
        function secret_google_search_algorithm($url) {
          $pagerank = 2;
          if (strpos($url, 'jeremy.visser.name') !== false)
            $pagerank = 10;
          return $pagerank;
        }
        endif;

btw. I wrap every function into a class to get my very personal namespace...

get_option('sidebars_widgets')
will give you something like the following:
array(1) {
     ["sidebar-1"]=> array(2)
     {
           [0]=> string(3) "bar"
           [1]=> string(3) "foo"
      }
}

best bet would be the position in the array will be the position
inside the sidebar.

Message-ID: <ae81acd10804091355w2f398128l16634f84b6c9c320@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

For the plugin check thingie to work, I thought the deal was: make
sure that the plugin name in the plugin's header and in its readme.txt
are the same.

Am I completely missing something obvious ?

To test things further, I've set up this piece of quick code that
pretends to send only one plugin with version 0.1 to the API server,
and see what it returns:
<http://pastebin.com/f22ebc8a6>
Usage is simple: test_update_plugin('Your Plugin Name')

- my plugin's header is :
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Admin Drop Down Menu
- my readme.txt starts with:
=== Admin Drop Down Menu ===

test_update_plugin('Admin Drop Down Menu'); // returns nothing, the
API server doesnt notice any update

But now, if instead of the plugin name, I check with its *SVN path*
(my plugin is in
<http://svn.wp-plugins.org/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/>)

test_update_plugin('ozh-admin-drop-down-menu'); // works
test_update_plugin('Ozh Admin Drop Down Menu'); // works

SVN directory name and plugin name should be allowed to be different,
just as plugin name and the filename itself ('My Super Plugin' vs
joe_myplugin.php) can be different.

So, my point is : this is totally *not* how I expected things to work :)

*smacks head*

That's why my plugin isn't showing that it has been updated. I was
wondering why nobody upgraded with the latest release.

test_update_plugin('ajaxd-wordpress'); // works

test_update_plugin('Ajaxd Wordpress'); // works

test_update_plugin("Ajax'd Wordpress"); // works

test_update_plugin('AJAXed WordPress'); // fails

Although, it had worked in the past because I was able to make the
last upgrade with it and the plugin was never released through extend
as "AJAX'd WordPress." +1 for this isn't the way it should work.

Thanks for the heads up.

I'm pretty sure that the API server will only let you do it every 12 
hours anyway and otherwise serve from the cache. I could be wrong.

The server doesn't care how often you ask for a list of updated
plugins - the server updates itself every 15 minutes anyway. This post
by Ozh http://groups.google.com/group/wp-hackers/browse_thread/thread/a9297a8c5514b3d3
answers the question as to why it didn't work for me. I wish that when
things like this change, someone would give a heads up. I've noticed
that many updated plugins are not announced on the plugin page - the
ones that are announced have plugin names that have SVN directory
names that match.

His linked article didn't mention WordPress. The FBI report seemed to  
reference overloading SMTP, was this a WordPress plugin issue, a  
WordPress issue, or just a very poorly configured server with respects  
to mail? So much of this depends on more info that might be noted in  
the FBI report.

In my case I've done one report for an incident (non-WordPress..  
awstats) to the FBI field office in New Orleans, they have been  
responsive in telling me information beyond what my pitiful forensics  
were telling me. So it would be interesting to see that FBI report in  
it's full glory I bet.

I agree.  It was his non sequitur that I was labeling an "Ouch".
WordPress had nothing to do with the story, yet a giant standing

Message-ID: <6ce151c6-1de7-40bd-8e8a-e4308ea1227d@a5g2000prg.googlegroups.com>

Recently, I've provided help to users when my plugin doesn't work
after activating it. The very first thing I suggest to them:
Deactivate all plugins, activate my plugin and if it begins working -
start activating other plugins until it stops again.

When they tell me which ones cause the plugin to stop working I start
looking at the code for those plugins. In all cases, the problem is
caused by plugin 'X' registering with the wp_admin_head() hook or by
registering some other call that causes Word Press to inject plugin
'X' java scripts and their java script dependencies for every single
backend page - this includes admin pages that are created for and used
by other plugins.

Frankly, this is just... bad behavior. It isn't difficult to determine
which backend page is about to be presented to the user. If your
plugin interacts with that page - great! If not, then don't create an
environment in which your plugin possibly renders another plugin
unusable.

Welcome to the happy world of plugin coding \o/
(it WordPress and Javascript in one word :)

I have a cut&paste message ready for my readers asking support for this 
type of conflicts, which basically says:
- tell your plugin author to use wp_enqueue_script() so that javascript is 
only added once
- tell your plugin author to add their javascript only on their own plugin 
page
- tell your plugin author not to use a javascript library that is already 
bundled with WP, but to use that one instead (no prototype.lite.js, no 
custom prototype or jquery, etc)

(hope it was not one of my plugins conflicting -- If so, reply off list so 
I dont look like a noob to others :)

maybe this one:
admin_head-(page_hook) or admin_head-(plugin_page)
and that one:
admin_print_scripts-(page_hook) or admin_print_scripts-(plugin_page)

should be some better documented...
I didn't got them to work in any way - I than just used admin_head and
checked, if the get params indicate that it's my plugin-page.
Using the above would have made this just a bit more easy (and less time
consuming, since I spend at least 1/2 hour trying to figure out what I have
to write instead of (plugin_page). Filename didn't work, Plugin Name didn't
work, called function didn't work...
Maybe I did something wrong and I would have worked with one of those
otherwise... but providing a nice minimalistic example wouldn't hurt
anybody.

This would - maybe - save some of the coders from missing to add it only on
the right page...

Here is a simple example that includes:
   1. registering your scripts and dependencies
   2. gets the requested URI and looks for the name of your registered
plugin file
   3. adds one of several actions that will add information before the
</head> tag

/* Register your scripts with WordPress via the wp script loader*/
register_script(
    'your-script-handle',
    'path-to-script/script_name.js',
     array('jquery', 'depends-on-script-handle', ...), 'your-script-
version-num');

/* get the currently requested URL */
$uri = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];

/* Looking for my plugin's php entry point */
if( stristr($uri, '<your_plugin>.php') != false ) {

   // add action here for injecting scripts or css
   add_action('wp_print_scripts', array('classname',
'function_name'));
   // or
   add_action('wp_admin_head', array('classname', 'function_name'));
   // or
   wp_enqueue_script(...)
   // or
   admin_print_scripts(...);
}
else {
     ; /* not my page - so nothing to do */
}

I'm sure everyone does this a little bit differently, however, the
most important aspect of this is to only inject java script on pages
that you create for your plugin's backend options or on backend pages
that your scripts interact with - not on backend pages that are used
as administration/option pages created for use by other plugins.

Other gotch's include NOT injecting jQuery.js before Prototype.js

Maybe others have suggestions

Add this function (included in WP 2.3 I think) in your plugins to  
enforce this:

if (!function_exists('wp_prototype_before_jquery')) {
     function wp_prototype_before_jquery( $js_array ) {
         if ( false === $jquery = array_search( 'jquery', $js_array ) )
             return $js_array;

         if ( false === $prototype = array_search( 'prototype',  
$js_array ) )
             return $js_array;

         if ( $prototype < $jquery )
             return $js_array;

         unset($js_array[$prototype]);

         array_splice( $js_array, $jquery, 0, 'prototype' );

         return $js_array;
     }

     add_filter( 'print_scripts_array', 'wp_prototype_before_jquery' );
}

jep sure this is nearly as I did it
function my_head() {
if( $_GET['page'] = 'mypage' {
// doit
}
}

but what I wanted to know is how to use the hooks which are especially
designed for not needing this:

admin_head-(page_hook) or admin_head-(plugin_page)
Runs in the HTML <head> section of the admin panel of a plugin-generated
page.

and

admin_print_scripts-(page_hook) or admin_print_scripts-(plugin_page)
Runs to print JavaScript scripts in the HTML head section of a specific
plugin-generated admin page.


(you will find them here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference#Administrative_Actions)

This ones were my prefered way to do that - if I just could figure out, what
that stuff to add after the normal hookname is - everything I tried just
didn't do anything...

Gotta love WP Super Cache. I've found that it even reduces problems on
dodgy shared hosting. Friend of mine was having script timeout issues
on his 2.5 site after upgrading. I installed the super cache and set
it up for him, and the admin menus became 10 times spiffier and
quicker to use, as the load from his somewhat high-traffic site was
quickly reduced.

It would be nice if there was a good whole-page cache framework in the
core, but until then, Super Cache does the trick nicely.

Don't know about others, but I know I'd never install any software without first
- reading some features
- reading some arguments on why it's cooler with it than without
- seeing some screenshots

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp-login.php changes in 2.5
Message-ID: <f186db7a0804101146q40d89dafp952d6d7ea1390e90@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I noticed that login is handled a little differently in 2.5.  This caused
Daniel Westermann-Clark's http-authentication (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/http-authentication/ ) plugin to break,
but just slightly.  Background: The purpose of the plugin is to check if the
user is already authenticated by looking for the REMOTE_USER environment
variable, as set by mod_auth or similar.  If yes, then it logs them in to WP
with the same username by setting the cookie.

The current implementation involves hooking wp_authenticate.  It looks like
the order of operations in 2.5 in wp-login.php has changed.  Previously it
called wp_authenticate no matter what, and the plugin could do it's magic.
Now wp-login.php calls wp_signon() in wp-includes/user.php, which returns
before calling wp_authenticate if it wasn't passed any credentials.  So why
not pass it credentials?  Well that sounds great.  How are we intended to do
this cleanly?

wp_signon() is not in pluggable.php and wp_login() is deprecated with a note
to use wp_signin() -- a function that as far as I can tell does not exist at
all.  Clearly someone had an idea for how logins should work, and these
changes were probably a good idea in some context.  Were they implemented
completely?  Can anyone point me at documentation for these changes or give
a suggestion as to how to fix dwc's plugin?

Thanks in advance,
Ben

I've always used this:

function myplugin_menu() {
   if ( function_exists('add_management_page') ) {
     $page = add_management_page( 'myplugin', 'myplugin', 9, __FILE__, 
'myplugin_admin_page' );
     add_action( "admin_print_scripts-$page", 'myplugin_admin_head' );
   }
}

As Ozh points out:

all of the functions that add plugin menu items to the wp menu:

 add_management_page(),
 add_options_page(),
 add_theme_page(),
 add_users_page()

 return a $hookname that you append to the action string:
"admin_print_scripts-"

Uh - cool think I got it now ;-) thanks.
Sometimes it the obvious things hide behind my complex thoughts ;-)
this way should be even better then checking the $_GET['page'] - any
thoughts?

heh, it looks like one can always learn new things, and one can always 
miss some details while reading source... I was using 
sanitize_title("somepage") to get the proper name for 
[hooks-]<somepage>_page_whatever, after finding out the hard way that 
i18n-ed Wordpresses also have translated hook names (which is very 
extremely dumb, if you ask me... reminds me of a story told by someone 
who worked for a company writing some Microsoft Office plug-in back in 
the day and went through hell since the function names were translated, 
so the API was, um, quite hard to predict...)

Passwords aren't MD5'ed anymore in the database (they are now salted and
uber-hashed via phpass), so that plugin won't work as it is right now
regardless.

I've actually added this to the codex for future reference. Feel free to 
edit it if it's too short, etc.

Howzit.

Just found that our 404 page isn't showing up, have a static page as
homepage, permalinks = ' /%post_id%/%postname%/', WordPress 2.5
installation is in the root. Interestingly it does show up if one puts
numerals in the url

So e.g. http://forgebusiness.com/123123123 results in the 404 page
But
http://forgebusiness.com/foofoo.php seems

gets redirected to http://forgebusiness.com/foofoo.php/
then loops through and displays pages with page.php, and apparently shows
pages of any status!?

Any ideas, please?

Thanx

Andr?

So as a quick fix, in the first line of page.php I looked into
$wp_query->post_count and if it is >1 do a 301 to my error page. (I don't
think the site's content has any paginated pages)

Only thing is, /index.php?error=404 was giving the same result of looped
pages, so redirecting to that would probably have caused an infinite loop
now i redirect to /404 which seems to work, untill I can figure out what's
going on or a better solution presents. :-<

That's fine if you want to insert something into the header manually,
but what if you want to use the right functions to actually enqueue a
script instead? admin_head and admin_print_scripts are too late to add
enqueue_script calls.

Should one hang that off load-$page_hook instead?

For Tarski's options page I've taken to doing this:

add_action('admin_print_scripts-design_page_tarski-options',
'tarski_inject_scripts');
add_action('admin_head-design_page_tarski-options', 'tarski_inject_styles');

Obviously you'll have to change it to reflect the particular section
you're adding the page to, as well as your theme/plugin's name.

Short answer is that you're right, you can't do it at all. The
do_action_ref_array('wp_authenticate'... got moved out of the
wp-login.php, where it was right after getting the posted info, into
wp_signon(), where now it doesn't run until after that info is checked
for cleanliness.

That happened here, BTW: http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/6643

Either the 'wp_authenticate' action needs to be moved up to earlier in
the function, or you can't do what you want to do.

Since admin_print_scripts-$page_hook or admin_print_scripts-$plugin_page 
both fire before admin_print_scripts, couldn't you enqueue then?  Or is 
that too late for some reason?

Argh. You're right, I was confused about what enqueue scripts needed
to do. My bad.

Oddly, it *does* work, but the user has to submit wp-login.php once first --
with any values -- so that the code can run.  Then if the user reloads their
original page request, they are logged in.  (It works because, in addition
to wp_authenticate, the plugin hooks check_passwords, so it overrides
everything that WP does with passwords.  This continues to work fine in
2.5.)  It really is just the order of operations change in wp-login.php that
we're trying to work around.

Thanks for the reference to the change.  If wp_signon was pluggable,
we would be able to do what we want, right?  It seems like this is the
best way to get the desired ability without disrupting the good work
that was already done.  There's even a comment in pluggable.php for
wp_login that says  * @deprecated Use wp_signin() which I'm thinking
indicates that someone wanted wp_signon() to be pluggable (since there
is no wp_signin) but it was just never implemented?

I would love to get this into 2.5.1 ... what would you recommend as
the best way to proceed?  I've done a lot of hacking on random stuff
but I'm new to this particular development community and would like to
go with the flow.  Is there a page I should read explaining the
preferred way to submit patches, etc?

I've summarized my tests & conclusions on this subject in 4 points:
1) SVN directory name,
2) plugin installation direction,
3) plugin name in readme.txt, and
4) plugin name in PHP file
must all be "consistent" if not equal. Longer story :

Would love some head honcho or core coder to review this, though, just
to be sure if I'm not publicly making a fool of myself :)

I for one, am a big fan of something like this.

Does it support inserting any kind of content, including php?

Given that there are existing hooks used for just this purpose by
plugins, I'm not really sure what's gained by this new implementation.

The Thing is: You do not need to write a Plugin for each pice
of JS Code you want to insert into the footer/header. Giving the user the
ability to insert non dynamic content easily (not every user is a coder, and
not every script which can be simply included has its own plugin now).

Eric: It would be simply silly to include PHP with a Plugin into the
header/footer. If you can write your own functions you can simply hook them
in.

I think it looks like an excellent idea.

I like the idea of additions that allow you to programatically alter  
themes without altering the theme files.  Makes installing updates to  
the theme a lot easier.

Personally, I use a fairly modified default theme.  I just recently  
updated it to include improvements to the newest version of the  
default theme -- I used a Diff application on the theme directory and  
then selectively apply differences to my customized theme.

That's not to hard for me because I'm a geek and I own useful software  
that the average blogger doesn't own.  It would be great to be able to  
easily make these changes without actually changing the files.

The inclusion of Widgets was a _big_ step towards this.  Your idea  
would act as a sort of text widget for the header.

I go back to Mark's point on the ticket -- why not alter Kubrick to
include widget bars for header and footer and add a couple new widget
types...

Again:
This is not something themes sould offer.
There are thousands of themes everywhere - when they are not updated to
include this (but do *work* anyway) this special added code will be gone.
Especially when they use sidebars with different names. Worst of all: It
might even stop existing, I do not know, but it would make sense that widget
data in sidebars which aren't used by the theme is deleted.

It wouldn't be too hard to add two plain text-fields into the theme pane (or
the widget pane, if you'd like it this way), which are inserted when wp_head
or wp_foot runs.

*but* this needs to be independent from themes. You can not rely upon what
is implemented into a themen, when you want to *change* the theme. You could
tell themes to use a special option for that too - but what would that be
good for? One uses it another one doesn't. The user can not know which one
uses it and which one doesn't. Most Themes aren't updated to frequently so
it wouldn't work with the most existing themes while the original idea
would.

I'd like to head about any stuff speaking against integrating 2 Textfields
(head-codes and foot-codes or whatever you'd call them) and putting the
content of the one into the head and the content of the other one into the
foot? Why would that be so foolish, that we should use widgets instead? (by
the way: I definitly hate the new widget control - its
workflow-performance and usability tend to zero)

Because, as the trac ticket says:

"The great thing about it, is that the snippets are going to be  
inserted no matter which theme you are using."

Alexander, I think you are misunderstanding the proposal.  (Heh... or  
_I_ am....)

The theme doesn't have to "offer" anything other than the standard  
wp_head() that allows _any_ plugin to add _any_ code.  Frankly, any  
theme that lacks wp_head() is, in my opinion, a broken theme.  At  
best, it is a significantly nonstandard theme....

This idea is very similar to widgets.  You could just as well argue  
that we shouldn't have sidebar widgets because we can just wait for  
theme authors to put the things we want into their themes.  (And  
anyway, it's not so hard to change the code, right?)

There is a distinct advantage to this idea, and NO drawback that I can  
see.

Stephen, it seams I forgot to quote Doug... this should have been an answer
to his question why not to do it with widgets... which would be something
the themes would have to offer.

Yes for sure wp_head (and wp_footer) have to be integrated into a theme for
it to be a working theme - and so we can rely on that.

"his idea is very similar to widgets. You could just as well argue that we
shouldn't have sidebar widgets because we can just wait for theme authors to
put the things we want into their themes. (And anyway, it's not so hard to
change the code, right?)"

sure - changing code souldn't be hard for any *wp-hackers* anyway ;-) but
there is a weak feeling there may be some more users left... oh well... we
should ignore them (please do not take me for serious this time)

As I thought I mentioned clearly (seems I wasn't as clear as I thought)
here:

"It wouldn't be too hard to add two plain text-fields into the theme pane
(or the widget pane, if you'd like it this way), which are inserted when
wp_head or wp_foot runs."

I am pro inserting 2 new textboxes into theme panel - this would do the
trick I think - it would be theme independent (but in the right place as
everyone will search for it there I think) and there wouldn't be any risk of
loosing this data (even when wp_head() and wp_footer() would not be called
the data would stay in the database for integration into another theme).

You do not have to convince me ;-)

Yes for sure it is easily possible - but widgets and tags were possible
before they were included too.

It would be nice to have some guidelines what is woth posting and what is
not.

They're intended for everything that you put in a post - music players, 
google maps, uploaders, polls, etc. That's why the icons are tiny, so we 
can have a bunch of them. :)

You can still edit files via the admin interface.
Design -> Theme editor -> Select theme -> Select file to edit (Thats for  
Theme files)

As for Plugin files, Plugins -> Plugin Editor -> Select plugin, will allow  
you to edit *that* plugin file, however, It does not allow editing of  
non-plugin files
So while i may have
plugins/my-plugin/plugin-name.php
plugins/my-plugin/plugin-name.css
I can edit the php file, but not the css file.

Is that what your asking? I'm a bit confused about your  
question(mentioning plugin files, then theme css?)

I don't think that's the case - I WISH it were.

I have a hand-hacked version of the recent-posts widget, modified to take
advantage of the caching system I'm using. I renamed it, removed the author
URI, and did a million different things, yet WP 2.5 keeps on asking me to
upgrade to the "new" version... 

For clarification:
File: wp-content/plugins/widgets/nst_recent.php
Name: "NST Recent Posts Widget"
Author: 

But I am STILL asked to "Download version 1.2.1.20070210b here" (linking to
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widgets/)

It's ONLY looking at the directory name ("widgets") and not at anything
else, and that's driving me crazy. It thinks that because there's a plugin
in a folder called "widgets" that means it's the same "widgets" plugin on
wordpress.org, and it wants to upgrade.

Message-ID: <FA2E69B5-DDDB-4176-9B03-D99A231BF1B8@randomnetworks.com>


Ticket 6612 ( http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6612 ) points to a  
blog post ( http://www.franzone.com/2007/07/30/wordpress-xml-rpc- 
patch-for-metweblog-newpost-method/ ) that details a problem with the  
dateCreated field in metaWeblog.newPost/editPost.

I was rather surprised to confirm this bug as detailed in the post.   
I figured if we'd had this problem for so long, one of the blog  
client authors would have complained about it before now :-)

I've attached a simple patch to the ticket that addresses this  
issue.  But date/time fields are particularly fragile in the current  
blog APIs, so I'd really like to get some feed back from folks in the  
field who have to deal with this before pressing forward.

Unless I'm remembering wrong, only all the plugin meta from the top of the
plugin file is sent to WP.org. The readme file is never touched.

You're right - I checked it - it really doesn't check readme.txt
but it shouldn't check against the folder in which the plugin resides too...
Confusing.

Message-ID: <4801E351.1020802@gmail.com>

I was just wondering, is it me, or is something just not working 
correctly.. I normally do:
 Start > Run > CMD > plink domain.net > enter passphrase > ls > cd to my 
directory > ls > svn up

And it works fine.. But lately, I've been getting messages like this... 
(Through CMD and Putty methods)...

user@mydomain.net [~/public_html]# svn up
svn: This client is too old to work with working copy ''; please get a 
newer Subversion client
user@mydomain.net [~/public_html]#

The only thing I could think of, is, I recently changed my domain name 
servers to another host, because Dreamhost.com is crap. Perhaps it's 
"inlinehosting.com's" fault? Or, what?

In February 2006 I wrote a Protoype.js version that tells a user if a plugin
is updated, here's how to do it in jQuery:

[script type="text/javascript"]
/**
* @desc ImageManager check for new version script
* @author Per Soderlind - www.soderlind.no
*/
jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery.get('http://www.soderlind.no/imagemanagerversion.txt',
function(newversion){
        if (251 < newversion) { // 251 is the vidersion number for the
installed plugin, I set number this using PHP
            jQuery('#plugins
td.name').filter(':contains(ImageManager)').append('new version
available').css('color','red');
        }
    });
});
[/script]

Note, you should put at break (i.e. a BR tag) in front of 'new version
available'

You'll find it explained at
http://www.soderlind.no/archives/2008/04/11/last-night-i-became-a-jquery-fan
/

BTW, you don't need this if you host your plugin at

Dreamhost's servers probably were using a newer version of SVN, and made
a note in the .svn folders (or something like that) that the client
needs to be version x.x to function with the working copy. Inline
Hosting's version of SVN, which was older than Dreamhost's copy, saw the
note and could not proceed.

You'll need to contact Inline Hosting and ask them to upgrade their
'svn' program. It's almost definitely their end.

Message-ID: <5dc2163e0804131315g6701333ei2ec8f4b90c90854b@mail.gmail.com>

In my gigs-calendar plugin, I created an easy way for people to edit the
layout of the output.  It includes having a templates folder in the plugin
folder and having them create their own templates.  This, of course, gets
obliterated during the plugin auto-upgrade.

Is there any way to hook into the upgrade process to tell it to preserve
certain files or folders?  If not, I'll have to have them save their
templates elsewhere.  It would be a good feature if it doesn't already
exist.

I was referring to template tags, which one may want to print to the

In my AJAXed WordPres plugin I have something similiar, but I offer
people the option to store some or all of the modified template files
in the theme's folder. It not only makes upgrades smoother, but it
also allows them to switch themes with ease.

I do't see why it couldn't be done, but I don't think that selective
deletes are the best option because there is too much that can go
wrong, and it will make the entire upgrade process more complicated.

Hmmm - well there may be some use for it but it is always risky to parse
db-stored code so I wouldn't want this to be enabled by default.
Another thing is: There will be themes which need this extra code and others
where this would be redundant.
I think the right way to do this is write your own plugin which inserts all
this the normal
way (calling the template-functions from within the wp_head() hook - you
should be able to use the template tags there without any problems).

Maybe one could put in some placeholders which trigger special template
tags. But I wouldn't allow custom php there for security reasons
(SQL-Injection-Vulnerabilities are not soo uncommon and one shouldn't make a
script injection possible with that...)

im working on a plugin, and when im building links i dont know to call

?page=widget-profiles/widgetprofiles.php
or
?page=widgetprofiles.php

in the code if i use just __FILE__ it fails if its installed in a folder?
know i have a little monkey hack to fix it for now, but whats the best
way to get the installed path of your plugin.

Here is a modified version of the function I use:

	function get_base(){
   		$base = end(explode('/',
str_replace(array('\\','/widgetprofiles.php'),array('/',''),__FILE__)));
   		if($base = 'plugins'){$base = '';}
   		return $base;
	}

It strips the file names, applies some windows fixes, explodes it on
the '/'s and then takes the last one. It kinda uses the long way, but
I was having issues using just the directory name function on some
set-ups. With this code, I've never had a problem on any set-up.

When calling the admin menu functions, such as add_submenu_page, you
can pass an arbitrary string for the $file argument, instead of the
file path itself.

So in your case you could do something like the following:

add_submenu_page('themes.php', __('Widgets Profiles',
'widgetprofiles'), __('Widgets Profiles',''widgetprofiles'),
'switch_themes', 'widgetprofiles', 'widgetprofiles_run');

Yeah, using the actual filename is fairly deprecated.

Sorry for the confusion.  Yes, I meant the plugin CSS file.  Does the
plugin editor only take PHP files?

Yes, The plugin editor is currently limited to(in 2.5 at least) editing  
the actual plugin php file.
So It'll edit my-plugin.php but not my-plugin-functions.php(If the  
functions file is not a plugin in itself..), and not my-plugin.css

I personally do not use the file editors, But i can see some people would  
like to, I recon it should be able to edit any file in the plugins folder  
myself.

One option would be to create new taxonomies for each type of tag.

In the examples you gave:

"Cities" and/or "States", "functions"
and/or "System Calls" , "Bugs" and/or "Feature Requests"

They could each be a new taxonomy, rather than "hacking" the post_tag 
taxonomy. My understanding of the system (I've been reading a lot of 
code!) is that this is the way it was designed. For example, with people 
in pictures, you can create a new taxonomy and make use of all the 
existing wp functions to manage it. It's quite a powerful system once 
you get into it.

Whenever you touch a working copy with a newer version of svn it records 
that version number and then won't work with any older versions. If 
you're not moving your working copy around, just delete it and create a 
new one, should work fine.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Does the term_taxonomy count get updated for future
	posts?
Message-ID: <480326DF.8020301@callum-macdonald.com>

G'day,

It appears that the wp_update_term_count() function is only called 
within the wp_delete_object_term_relationships() and 
wp_set_object_terms() functions. For the post_tag and category 
taxonomies, the _update_post_term_count() function is called to update 
the count.

This function uses the following SQL query:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $wpdb->term_relationships, $wpdb->posts WHERE 
$wpdb->posts.ID = $wpdb->term_relationships.object_id AND post_status = 
'publish' AND post_type = 'post' AND term_taxonomy_id = '$term';

This query only counts terms which are applied to published posts. 
Therefore, it does not count any terms where the post_status is future. 
That makes sense.

However, I can't find anywhere when the wp_update_term_count() function 
is called when a post is transitioned from future to publish status. So, 
in theory, if a user published a whole bunch of future posts and then 
didn't post anything else, the term_counts would never be updated.

I'm pretty sure this is correct, and therefore a bug, but I'm not 
absolutely 100% confident, so I haven't filed it in trac yet. Can anyone 
confirm if this is correct, or if in fact I've missed something?

Cheers - Callum.

Hello,

the new update routine causes sometimes strange problems. I integrated
in my subversion repo some binary files (translation .mo file, TTF
font and some flash player).

Since users update via the inbuilt auto upgrade , I receive strange
feebdack : "Flash didn't work, TTF not recognize, localization didn't

works...

Has anybody noticed the same ? Must I remind/setup something with
SubVersion during check in for those files ?

This may be the result of another bugfix gone awry.

I recall a bug in trac where future posts would cause the count to
update immediately instead of when the post transitioned.. Perhaps the
"fix" only did half the job?

Yes, I'll put in a patch/ticket and see what the devs think.

I haven't used it in public plugins, but I just store files in new
folders under /wp-content/, then edit them using my own basic editing
screen that calls the specific files.

Really though, it's probably easier to just let them edit an option
holding the formatting (if they dont' like the default) and use that
to define layout rather than using actual files, which seems like it
will always make a mess for some systems (I like to use files for
backups of complex option info though, as it's not the end of hte
world if it doesn't work and you have a file backup in case you have
to ditch your whole DB for some reason).

That's what I'm going to have to do for the next version.  I just didn't
want to clutter up wp-content.

The templates I'm using are for the front-end display and let them do much
more complex things than they could do if they were limited to entering CSS
info or HTML with non-php template tags into a DB field.

Freaky and paranoid question/sidenote:
Is it possible to validate that the source code is exactly the code which
was used to build the "random software"?
You'd have to compile it yourselfe for being sure it is...

And then, of course, you have to trust the compiler as well, as Ken
Thompson demonstrated in 1984:

You can do whatever you want. It's your plugin (and your support time
with people on PHP4 webhosts)

PHP 2.5 supports PHP 4.3+ IIRC.  I generally try to code along with the
latest version of WordPress, but like Ozh said, do whatever you like.

If you explicitly say that it's PHP 5 only in the plugin description,
and add some code like this to it, then you won't get as many support
issues.

function myplugin_activation_check(){
	// check to see if this plugin will even work
	if (version_compare("5.0", phpversion(), ">")) {
		deactivate_plugins(basename(__FILE__)); // Deactivate ourself
		wp_die("ERROR! You can't run this plugin. It requires PHP 5 or above.");
	}
}
register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'myplugin_activation_check');

And there you go. When they try to activate it, they get told a big
fat "no" and it fails to activate as well. Simple.

Subject: [wp-hackers] New password encription
Message-ID: <cd9704tajsle6nnm841gnsg6u1cdn4qbri@4ax.com>

WIth old method if i lost my password i can force it in the user table
changin it an setting to cede it MD5.

With 2.5 this won't work anymore. You will say that I can always get
new password by email and you are right. But anyone that have some
expirience in sw assistance to end user knows that people do the worst
things everytime in the worst way possibile.

So sometime people come out on forum saying theyr 2 years blog updated
to 2.5 was all ok bur ask for password and he didn't remeber it, and
when installed he used a mail he do not use anymore or mistyped by
mistake or purpose. Or maybe they will always had problem with email
with that hosting etc etc.. so the solution to touch the database
changine eamil to get a new one doens't wok too... I kknow sound
fantascientific.. but i got people like that..

I was wondering how solve this cases with new password codification
cause you can't installa Ryan plugin to revert hasing method to pre
2.5 etc... any idea?

Hehe .. good answer, but I guess my question should have been more precise
i.e. when will WordPress "ditch" PHP 4.

>when will WordPress "ditch" PHP 4.

When a majority of hosts ditch PHP 4.

As irritating as PHP 4 is, a lot of hosts still use it, and it is not
worth irritating WordPress users just because their hosts are "bad."
Kind of like switching all the gas stations to hydrogen stations
overnight. It would be the car manufacturer's fault for building cars
that run on gas, but there is no reason to alienate your customer.

If I remember the implementation details correctly, you could still use a
similar technique and replace the database value with one that has been
salted using the same secret key from another system that you do have access
to, if you wanted to do it that way. I wouldn't recommend it though, since
there are much easier solutions.

I'm not clear why the standard e-mail reset would not be a better option
than trying to overwrite the hashed password value. For one thing, it would
not require direct access to the database.

Even under the circumstances you describe (messages sent to the original
admin e-mail address are not accessible for some reason), you could always
change that e-mail address in the DB, since in your scenario mentioned above
you *do* have direct access to the database.

If you're saying that you couldn't install a plugin after the fact to let
you into the blog you're locked out of, that's correct, at least for the
sake of simplicity in this scenario. (Of course, if you have direct DB
access you could activate plugins without logging in if you knew what you
were doing, but we'll assume that is not viable in this case).

However, if you still really don't like the new password handling, I do
believe the whole process is pluggable, so you could theoretically change it
to work differently if you really felt you needed to. Just bear in mind that
these changes were made to address legitimate security concerns, and working
around them for the purposes you describe above is probably a bad idea.

You can simply replace it with a md5 without having to enable any plugins.

WordPress can determine if the value is a md5 or a phpass hash, If its a  
MD5, then it will validate you based on md5, and then update the password  
hash to a phpass hash.

I had the same problems a few days ago, I needed access to a temp trunk  
install, and i'd forgotten to change the password from the default, I  
simply did an update wp_users set password = md5('test'); and everything  
was up and running again (You might want to add a Where clause to that.. i  
only had one user :))

I think the point is that's it's generally a bad idea for anyone to install
a random executable application posted to a mailing list by someone they
don't know or trust.

It's nothing personal, but it's unlikely that many people will install the
client and give you feedback on that part of your code, for that reason.

As said, you can do whatever you want, especially if your plugin really
needs to make use of PHP5 functions, but the "recommended" thing to do is to
support all versions of PHP and MySQL that WordPress supports, which is
currently PHP4.

To be honest, as awesome as PHP5 is, you can most of the time avoid using
the new functions if you plan ahead.

Maybe I'm just stupid, but I downloaded, scanned for viruses, and
installed.  I've helped send several bug reports to Vladimir, and he
responds quickly.

The program is coming along quite nicely.

Other than the fact that <p> is not valid in an RSS2 feed, it does
work. I use that very method to insert a few things into the feed. Geo
tags, for one.

Well, besides the double quote after the function name in add_action(), it
works fine for me.

Did you make sure to hard refresh your feed? Most browsers cache feeds.

If I encode it like this can I insert HTML?

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>test</p>]]></content:encoded>

And yes Viper, the double quote is a typo I made when pasting it.

Yeessss... But there's already a content:encoded in the feed, so you'd
still be making it invalid.

I mean, it'll work, and if you view the feed source you'd see your
text in the feed. So as far as testing goes, it'll work.

Thanks Otto.  I looked at the spec* in the namespace and thought to
use this:

<content:item>
<![CDATA[
<p>my content</p>
]]!>
</content:item>

If you're trying to add to the post contents in feeds, just use the
"the_content" filter and abort if is_feed() returns false.

Thanks Viper. I tried that, and it seems to work.

function addAds() {
   echo '<p>Content</p>';
}

if (is_feed())
  add_action('the_content', 'addAds');

Odd, that shouldn't work as is_feed() isn't defined when plugins are loaded
last I looked.

Try this code. And you shouldn't be echoing, you should be returning.


function addFeedAds( $content ) {
if ( !is_feed() ) return $content;

return $content . "\n\n My ads here";
}

add_filter( 'the_content', 'addFeedAds' );

Ok, I put in a ticket (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6732).  I
started to create a patch, but got lost trying to build an array of
allowable files.

what about leaving this choise for the user?
maybe there will be plugins featuring .template or whatever files so this
choise could be left for the user (entryfield, seperate fileextensions by ,
or whatever delimiter. Could default to php, xhtml, html, htm, js, css and
maybe txt since this will be the most common I think - but you may even
choose not to set any defaults and only show php until someone wants more
and enters it into that field. If one really wants to edit an image file via
texteditor - hey why stop him, "normal" text editors don't stop them eighter
;-)

This won't work because:
1) when the plugin loads, is_feed() may or may not work. Test on is_feed() 
*after* everything is loaded.
2) your function addAds() will not return any content to the_content(), 
I'm not sure this is what is expected
2.1) for code readability: add_filter() instead of add_action()

Indeed they were, that's one of the reasons you had to login again after
upgrading -- it needed your raw password so it could rehash it.

No problems here. I've had a couple hundred/thousand people I assume update
one of my plugins that has images and a Flash file and no reports of any
problems.

Even updated the plugin on my own installs via the updater.

Message-ID: <71ddd7490804150528h3a8d0be9sd787403e76957d97@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
I've been plunking along on a theme and have been using the very nice
Mini Icons 2 (available here:
http://www.brandspankingnew.net/archive/2006/12/hohoho.html) and I am
just about ready to release the theme.  However, I noted last night
that the MI2 icons are licensed under Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 2.5.  If I read the FSF/Gnu take correctly,
CC-anything is not GPL-compatible, thus I'm not really sure if I can
include them with my (intended-to-be) GPLv2'd theme.

I've not licensed my work yet, so perhaps there is another
WP-compatible license that I could ship the theme under to skirt
this..?

Thoughts? Suggestions?  Pointers to excellent GPL/LGPL-compat icons?

No, mere "aggregation" doesn't mix licenses. These icons are separate
files in the theme. It's one thing when icons are compiled into object
code and included with a program, it's wholly another when the files
are entirely separate, even if they're in the same ZIP file.

If you put the icons in a separate directory of the theme, and stick a
readme in there with the CC licensing, then you're probably good. The
GPL doesn't, and cannot, expand to cover artwork when there's a clear
layer of separation. It's referencing the artwork, not including it.

Otto:
I take your point, but then I'm _distributing_ the theme myself, which
means I'm under the CC-A/SA restrictions the original author licensed
the icons under, thus I can't feasibly claim to be distributing a
GPLv2 theme.

My contributions and alterations are based on GPL and even public
domain sources (as far as code goes), so I'd really love to stick with
the GPL for the whole package.  If I want to distribute the icons,
though, I'm at least thinking it rises to a "poison pill".

I would LOVE for you to show me that I'm wrong (it's going to be
narsty trying to find all the CSS references to the images...)

For GPL Icons check if this ones meet your needs:
http://www.lullabot.com/articles/free_gpl_icons_lullacons_pack_1
http://paularmstrongdesigns.com/projects/ (on the right you'll find the
Gallery 2 Icon Set)

Here is one which is LGPL and therefor should be complient (yes the page is
in german - the download link should be readable for everyone anyway ;-) )
http://www.nddesign.de/news/2007/10/15/NDD_Icon_Set_1_0_-_Free_Icon_Set

You could also check out the list you find under
http://www.maxpower.ca/free-icons/2006/03/05/
(which license applies to which iconset is listed there too)

Maybe you will also want to check the OpenClipart Library (
http://www.openclipart.org/ ) there are plenty of icons in it and they are
all "in the public domain" so there will be no licensing issues at all. They
are available as .svg so you can generate the best fitting size for each of
them. But they are done by very different people and you will have some work
a) finding the right ones and b) putting them together so they all look
alike.

it's going to be narsty trying to find all the CSS references to the images
>
not if you have them in a seperate directory and have a good editor at hand.
If you didn't and have other images in the same directory maybe an editor
with regexp search would be of great help... notepad++, vim,... as for the
free ones - e (for example) if you want a non free editor (yep why should
one want this? I use e anyway since it is pretty cool anyway ;-) )

You sound like you have them in different files (searching/replacing in one
file wouldn't be much work at all)
If you're using windows try notepad++ which features "search in files"
(don't know about any other free win editor which features this)
If you own dreamweaver (or know someone who does) you can even "search &
replace" in files which would make work even more easy.

If you're working on linux try sed (should be shipped with it anyway) for
automatic replacements or grep to find all of the references
If you're working on mac I am the wrong person to ask - but textmate should
work fine (I regret not being able to use it n windows and have to use "e"
which tries to emulate textmate...)

If you do not want to do this stuff:
Get your icons and simply replace the old files - you do not need to edit
one line of css...

CC and GPL are not complient and there is no way out of that. You should be
able to link them but you shouldn't be able to package them as far as I
understand it. As long as you do not want to host them yourselfe best bet
would be to change the icon set (or your license - where I do not know if
non GPL complient licenses for  WordPress themes for are possible at all...)

Nonsense. The theme is not the icons and the icons are not the theme.
And merely packaging two things in the same compressed file does NOT
force them to be under the same licenses, and any interpretation that
it does is simply silly.

You have permission to distribute the theme and the icons. Whether you
distribute them together or apart is irrelevant.

Many thanks for the links.  The Maxpower one, in particular, I had
come across previously but just plum forgot.

I've been moving most of the iconography over to a core style.css file
for a bit (I'm allowing for subthemes with their own assets and CSS to
be plunked into a styles/ sub-directory in the theme), so I'm likely
just overthinking the issue.  A good ol' fashioned grepping will in
all respects do the trick.  I was more thinking, though, of replacing
the icons with something new and then having to account for (likely)
different icon sizes and thus readjusting padding, margins, etc.

But thanks again for the links.

So you're a lawyer huh?
Both licences are copyleft and want the *whole work* to be under the same
license. You can not put the CC-BY-SA under GPL nor other way round. So you
can not do that.

Here is what the Free Software Foundation says about that:
"Perhaps the most straightforward one [problem] is that they're both
copyleft licenses: each license wants the entire work to be released under
its own terms, so no matter what you do you can't satisfy them both."

found reading this article: http://www.linux.com/feature/119212

Any you can not tell me that the icons bundled and linked are not part of
the theme. Remember: There is LGPL for especially this purpose: To be
includable in non GPL'ed work. No one would have done that if there was no
need for it.

Another Idea though would be to ask the theme author for permission to
include it in GPL work under GPL License - maybe he'll add another licence
which is nearly compatible when you hand in some information about the
troubles you have including the work (the article I mentioned in my previous
mail ( http://www.linux.com/feature/119212 ) may help)

"*Share Alike*. If you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may
distribute the resulting work only under the same or similar license to this
one." [1]

Since your just including the icons (which I would be hard pressed to think
qualifies as building upon the work), I don't think you need to worry about
making your code CC-licensed.

+1 to Beutl's idea as well

Just want to clarify:
I do not see any problems from CC's side

And the theme would be something like a Collective Work I think, which is
definded as following:

*"Collective Work"* means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or

The only troubles I see are that GPL doesn't allow some stuff. Especially
the following (taken from CC-BY-SA full juristical version) doesn't fit into
GPL (but there will be more examples if one dives deep enogh into the
issue):

If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
> the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to
> such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
>

Anyway: You'll have a chance of about 99% that the author of the icons has
no problem with his work being included and will give you the permissions to
do so. I think this is more of a theoretical approach then of a real issue -
especially because this icons are not designed to be printed or presented
but used in (free)(web)applications which is exactly what you want to do.

That still doesn't make you known to this community. Or trusted for  
that matter. Of course this is all semantics, and people fall across  
the whole spectrum of this, as others who trusted their known virus  
scanner to make themselves comfortable with your software enough to  
try it. Others could load a virtual image and play with it inside that  
sandbox. So there are options for those interested enough in the  
software to safely try it out. However, its very unlikely that you're  
going to win over the rest of them that insist on source code and  
checksums from trusted and known sources.

I guess my point is this: you can't win 'em all.

Another tack that occurred to me:
Distribute the theme sans icons and state that anyone wishing to get
the "full" effect download the (separately-licensed) add-on pack and
just drop it into the images/mini2 sub-directory or somesuch.

That would likely hamper adoption of the theme, but at least the
licenses would be clean.  I'll contact the artist/author and see what
he thinks of a relicense/dual license scenario.

There's no problem on CC's side, obviously.

But where, exactly, do you see the GPL defining what a "whole work" is?

Can you give me a reasonable argument that the theme is a derivative
of the icons because it references them as external files? That
*executable code* is a derivative of *easily replacable graphics
files*? It's referencing them externally to itself.

If a GPL'd program uses a non-free library, can it be released? Gnu
says yes, although they waffle about it a bit:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FSWithNFLibs

Here's the thing, he wrote the theme, therefore he is the copyright
holder to that theme. Since he derived the theme from GPL code, he's
obligated to release it as GPL if he releases it at all. But the
"theme" does not necessarily include the icons. He didn't create
those. He doesn't hold copyright on those. And his theme is certainly
not a derivative of those. But their terms say that he can
redistribute them (ShareAlike), so he's perfectly fine.

So what if they are not distributed independently? My point is that
when you start arguing that you can bypass the GPL by making two ZIP
files instead of one, then you're talking crazy. The GPL is not that
simplistic.

WordPress 2.5

Go to Manage / Pages
Assign a page a parent and save the change
Go to Manage / Categories
You now have a new category named '1'

I've tried this on two of my online web sites along with my local
server test site and they all seem to do the same thing. Word Press
(somewhere along the way) calls wp_insert_term. I'm fairly sure it has
something to do with attempting to add categories to a page in the
post update call.

I gave it a try on my main site (not a very good idea, I know!) but
can't verify your result/your site's behaviour.

But I noticed some weird result:
o) I gave my (edited) "About"-page a new parent as described. Now a "new"
About-Page appears in my main-navigation: it's URI is "/about-2/" (I am
using perma-links). The content seems to be the same as of a fresh/plain
WordPress-installation (say: the standard text-block beginning with "This is
an example of a WordPress page, you could edit this to ...")
o) the "original" /about/ is under it's new parent - but it is not indented
(?) as expected, it breaks the layout (a bit).

So I put the page in it's correct context and layout seems normal. The
/about-2"-page isn't linked anywhere but I am able to find it when searching
for it's content.

This might be a theme problem on my side, just wanted to give a somewhat
detailed response.

Hope this is somewhat useful?

You may want to consider making your client platform-independent. I've
wanted a comment client for a while, but even though I have a
Vista-Linux dual boot, no single program is worth booting into Vista.

I think a large number of professionals who are using WordPress to the
extent that they need a client are also likely to be using a
non-windows operating system.

Hey everybody,

I wrote and maintained a LDAP auth plugin for WP while I was working  
for a university, but I'm not there any longer.
I'm also not in an LDAP environment anymore either and saying I have  
no time for the project is the understatement of the century.

Question is: would anyone be interested in picking up the project?

It's not an overly complicated plugin, and the user base is friendly. ;)

Let me know if anyone is interested.

Hmm.. I've upgraded the nextGen gallery a few times and have not yet

I'll give it a shot with a non-english locale maybe later.

Message-ID: <6cbe58c00804151739l33762dfvb3382e0421a14f61@mail.gmail.com>

This was driving me crazy.  I could access the 'Class' (that prototype
built) If i put my java above the wp_head() call but the java in my
plugin fails if I call
...
var TabMonster = Class.create({
	initialize: function(tab_list_container,options){
...
 from within a hook to wp_head().
So does lightbox or any plugin that relays on the Prototype framework

So it turns out that teh ShareThis plugin brings in some java from
w.sharethis.com that has its own Class def that over writes prototype.
lame.

This code is for my dynamically-tabbed-widget-sidebar mutation that
needs to make a custom Prototype controller.  See what im talking
about
http://iheartwp.com/wp-content/plugins/widget-extend/widget-extend-tabsidebar.phps
http://iheartwp.com/wp-content/plugins/widget-extend/tab.monster.0.1.js

any one else using ShareThis have or notice this problem?

You could consider moving your functionality over to an Adobe AIR
application [1], which would make it completely compatible with Windows and
OSX.

I know there are a few WordPress AIR apps available [2], but what I can
piece together from your description, the features your application offers
are different to what is currently available.

Would that also make the AIR app safe to use even if the author isn't
necessarily trusted?
I'm not sure what protection the main AIR application offers from rouge AIR
apps, anybody know?

I'm not sure what degree of "sandboxing" etc. that AIR provides, in terms of
preventing malicious authors from doing nasty things to your computer, but
if you're worried about that you could run it in a VM, etc.

You'd still have the risk of people running an app like this against their
"real" blogs, and trusting their login credentials to be kept private and
only used for the stated purpose of the app. You could always just run it
against a local (non-publicly-accessible) blog for testing purposes, but
assuming the testing is successful, do you then start using it on your real
blog?

Of course, you could then further attempt to secure yourself by analyzing
the network traffic that it's generating, making sure that it's not phoning
home or embedding your personal info somewhere on your blog that the author
could then later retrieve, etc. etc. It's all a matter of how paranoid /
security concious you are, I guess.

That just depends how much harm you're able to do with HTML/JS
(rendered by WebKit) or Flash/Flex. There's less risk than a normal
program, however.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is it possible to validate form data added in the
	add_meta_box
Message-ID: <3283f0830804152056sda100e9jf33cfc319557c5f6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm using the add_meta_box hook to create custom fields on the write post
and write page forms. The fields are inserting as expected into the DB
through publish_post, etc, but I was wondering if there was anyway to do
server-side validation of the data entered into my forms.

For example, if I have a "Number Field", is there a hook called before or in
conjunction with edit_post, save_post, and publish_post that would allow me
to run a PHP function to make sure the data was numeric in nature, and if
not, stop the form from being processed and return the page with an error
message? I realize that I can definitely validate in the publish_post, etc
hooks, but my problem is how to notify the user if it fails to validate.

I couldn't find any documentation or even discussion about this. If it
exists, could someone point me in the correct direction?

Thanks.

Not much.

Java. .NET/Mono. Flash. Air. Self-contained PHP. PyGTK. 

So many possibilities... not a mountain-moving task, really.

You could say that....
I'm the founder of NeoSmart Technologies - http://neosmart.net/

I've been publishing free software through NST since 2004, including
cross-platform .NET/Mono components. Perhaps you've heard of EasyBCD [1],
used by Microsoft and featured in over two dozen tech magazines and
downloaded almost 3 million times.

Anyway, I'm a keynote speaker at the Jordan Open Source Conference this May,
and I'll be giving a lecture on best techniques and technologies for
cross-platform desktop software development in mixed Windows/Linux
environments (the Middle East isn't big on Macs).

Qualified enough?

Thanks for links. *nix platforms interesting for me. But... I am absolutly
blind and for developing uses screenreader. Many applications not
accessability for me.
Talking about my comment client for WP I mast say what  my application uses
many libraries such as xml-rpc parser, http client, internet explorer and
spell-checker from MS-Word. Where can fount this library in crossplatform
framework?? I hope what my point understandable.

I've seen it, But i've not been able to locate any information about it.
Granted i've not seen any security@wordpress.org emails, so devs *may* be  
aware of something.

There was a recent commit which added more prepared queries:  
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7645 theres a few in there related to  
comments, But i think they're all escaped correctly allready.

"Attackers can use a browser to exploit these issues." also means there's  
only 3 main forms of attack, The Commentor name, The Commentors URL, and  
the actual comment, I took a quick look at them, and they seemed to be  
escaped ok for me.
I have a feeling if there is indeed a problem, that its probably something  
to do with Custom Database collations/charsets & WP not being able to  
escape them fully, there was a previous SQL injection which used something  
like that IIRC.

Take this message with a grain of salt of course, I'm no dev, Nor would i  
not be supprised if i missed something basic when looking over it.. But  
honestly, If there *was* a huge problem, then 2.5.1 most likely would've  
been rolled out faster, and there'd be many commits trying to get  
everything else thats wanted to be fixed in 2.5.1 done..

Just my 5c (Rounded up of course :P)

If you can use web-pages then you can use Adobe AIR - applications created
using XHTML, CSS and Javascript should be completely accessible for you.

I'm not sure that's possible. AIR was created to be that cross-platform
environment, there may be other projects like it but to my knowledge Adobe
AIR would be you best bet. Without it, you'll have to create three separate
applications for Windows, Mac and Linux users respectively. And if there are
built in security features inside the main AIR application itself, you
wouldn't have to worry about people 'trusting' you.

Just my 2 cents, take it or leave it :)

I got something similar on wordpress.com; I thought "ok, tags are all I 
want in this case, I don't need no stinkin' categories", so I converted 
them all to tags. After that, existing posts appeared to be posted in 
"unclassified", and new posts appeared to be in the "1" category, 
although I made sure to uncheck it when I wrote something... I 
eventually surrendered and gave "1" a more meaningful name.

it is probably a different (older) version of prototype; had they used 
the script loader, it would load the Wordpress-supplied prototype 
library and ignore the rest, and wouldn't break everything else; but 
then again, their plugin would not be guaranteed to work across 
Wordpress versions

this is a complicated problem, actually, because few libraries can 
accommodate several of their own versions running at the same time 
(actually, the only one I know is jQuery), and there is not much you can 
do, except for warning the users (or rewriting your javascripts for 
jQuery ;)).

This is what I found out using the software on many blogs - I didn't check
one line of code with this issue so I may be wrong anyway:

WordPress doesn't allow Posts not being assigned into a catagory for some
reason which I do not understand... so there is no chance in not haveing at
least one category. you may call that 1 or whatever you like - if you've got
a standard category and kill that one it seams WordPress will create a new
one whenever you post the next post which will have the id of the category
which was the standard one before as a name. Maybe this is exactly what
happens when you post a page and have no category matching the id saved for
standard category...but as I said I didn't check this - only checked if the
same happens when I follow those steps but failed in archiving what you
described.

After reading the Matt's post about it i realesed that reading the
secutiry focu report i wshould have been able to release by myself was
poor report with no evidence of the problem.

Infact in other cases the response was fast aout serious security
problem like ksess one.

Thanks all for the answers

which really isn't hard since jQuery offers great tabs, slides, accordeon
features by plugin.
To be precise you do not even need to write javascript code with some of
them.
Please have a look at the user interface plugins you'll finde here:
http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Plugins/category/21
(well there are so many of them that not every one is on that page  but on 3
pages.)

If you do use extensive JS for anything check out the plugin pages first -
you will find that there is much work you can stop worrying about doing
yourselfe.

Hi,

I'm working on CopyOz.com - but I have an interesting problem.

Whenever I insert the code to load the latest blog posts in my navigation:

                <ul><?php
                        $posts = get_posts('numberposts=5&offset=0');
                        foreach ($posts as $post) :
                    ?>
                    <li>
                    <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>" title="<?php
the_title() ?>"><?php the_title() ?></a>
                    </li>
                    <?php
                        endforeach;
                    ?>
                </ul>

It changes my home page, which is supposed to be "You're Not in Kansas
Anymore" to my first and only blog post - and not even correctly at that
(comments don't load, and neither does the comment form)

The navigation is far from done, but you get the idea from what is there.

I'm subscribed to the digests, so it would work better if you email me
direct at mayobrains@gmail.com - thanks for your help!

I looked through the comments code myself and didn't see the escaping, so I
sent a email off to security and Ryan responded back to me pointing out this
code in wp-settings.php:

// Escape with wpdb.
$_GET    = add_magic_quotes($_GET   );
$_POST   = add_magic_quotes($_POST  );
$_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes($_COOKIE);
$_SERVER = add_magic_quotes($_SERVER);


Everything that comes in there should be escaped by those functions. So I
can't find an exploit through the comments door.

Ok thanks for testing,

let's keep it in our mind, after several thousand downloads I don't
feel
it's a general problem (otherwise the forums & my email account will
explode...)

You might want to consider emailing the plugin author as well. I'm sure
that's unexpected behavior.

Message-ID: <161617690804160720v15311882wf4b58bc349e9a1e1@mail.gmail.com>

I got curious about the WP-Spamfree plugin a while back, so decided to do a
little experiment of my own.

WP-Spamfree basically blocks spam by doing the following:
1. Inserts a javascript into the comment space that, when run, sets a
cookie.
2. Checks the cookie when a comment is submitted, and kills the comment if
no cookie is found.

Simple solution, albeit not really a way of checking "spam". Still, I was
curious, so I implemented my own little version in a much simpler way:

In my theme's comments.php
<input type="hidden" name="some_random_name" value="1" />

Near the top of wp-comments-post.php
$nospam = (int) $_POST['some_random_name'];
if (!$nospam) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden');
    exit;
}

Easy, yeah? Simple check for an extra form field, quick death if it's not
there.

I also disabled Bad Behavior, to let the deluge in and see what happened.

Results after a month or so:
- Instant drop in comment spam. I mean *instant*. It went from several
hundred a day to zero.
- Large drop in CPU load, since I put this before any of the other PHP code
loaded.
- Regular comments have continued with no issues or complaints or any
noticeable decline in quantity.
- Akismet still catches lots of trackback spam (since I'm not doing anything
about that), but the number of comment spam I've had since putting this in
is in the single digits.

Conclusion:
Spammers, for the most part, are not loading the comments form and using it.
They're merely hitting a list of sites and the wp-comments-post.php file
directly. Renaming this file and adjusting accordingly has much the same
effect as using a hidden field, of course.

Question: Could nonces be used for this sort of thing? Or something similar
that would be a bit more secure than a simple field like this?

I'm trying to disable the media buttons tab (actually trying to disable

Any idea (I've looked at the media_buttons action, but ...)?

Otto -

I was wondering how effective it is if people have javascript turned off 
when they visit?

I dunno.

Anyway, to your question - I'm one of those people who *HATE* captchas. 
  But someone taught me a trick for my own forms (I generally write my 
own contact forms) so that I could prevent the automation (like you're 
talking about) but allow "real" people through.  I've never tried it 
with my comments though.

Basically, the thing is, when spammers "automate" - they basically fill 
in every input field available.  They don't check to see what the fields 
are, they just stick stuff in.  They do this for hidden fields, as well. 
  So I've taken that to my advantage, and put in a hidden field labeled 
"Surprise".  The script then checks to see if any input is placed in 
that hidden field.  If not, then it's allowed to go through.  If content 
*is* placed in that field, then it stops it dead in its tracks. (For the 
record, I even have an "accessible" notice - so if people are using 
screen readers, they get a message telling them NOT to put in anything 
in the field.)

It's worked pretty well.  I still get occasional attempts, but I've 
managed to filter the whole [url] thing and http:// thing to prevent it.

I don't know if that helps any, but I always thought it would be a nice 
idea to put something like that in the comments script - it's pretty 
simple.  I just haven't had the time to try it out.

That's one of the reasons I don't care for WP-SpamFree, it relies on
Javascript. I like my sites to be handicap-accessible where possible,
and so I try to stick to standards. Rejecting comments because of no
javascript is just poor form, IMO.

The problem with that in terms of comments is that my own experience
tells me that comment spammers, for the most part, are not filling in
form fields on an automated basis, they are simply sending automated
POST requests directly to sites. Looking through logfiles, I see lots
of hits to wp-comments-post from IPs that never loaded a page just
before they started spamming me with comments.

I imagine your approach would work quite well for custom submission
forms, since anything custom can only be done automated through the
approach you're describing.

You might also consider making a field that is not "hidden" except via
CSS. This would prevent the form from showing up to anybody but a
spammer might be more prone to fill it in.

Have you tried this in a plugin or in the theme's functions.php file?

remove_action( 'media_buttons', 'media_buttons' );

That should eliminate the buttons from showing at all.

After my own experiments, in which I logged everything about comment
submitters for weeks, I've come to a different conclusion.  My
comments preview plugin[1] changes the comment form's action attribute
to the post's permalink (from wp-comments-post.php), so I tried
deleting wp-comments-post.php with no noticeable drop in comment spam.

I think you may have gotten the results you did simply because you
didn't wait long enough for the spam bots to spider your site with the
new "some_random_name" field.  I've noticed that often the IP address
submitting the spammy comment had not recently requested the page with
the comment form, and I've seen spammy comments submitted to obsolete
form action attributes, sometimes months old.  This suggests to me
that the spam bots scrape sites then later do the dirty work of
submitting spammy comments.

What I have found[2] is that forcing comment previews alone reduces
comment (i.e. not ping/trackback) spam by 95%, and then checking for a
nonce based on the IP address of the original previewer gets just
about everything else (my comments preview plugin does this if you set
it to force previews).

By the way, about 55% of my total spam was trackback spam, and I've
eliminated virtually all of it just by using the Simple Trackback
Validation plugin[3], so I've turned off Akismet (which used to catch
hundreds of spams a day).

Of course, these are club solutions[4], but at the moment they're
working great.

I'm sorry - that's what I meant :)

It's *not* hidden, it's still text, but it's given a class so it's 
hidden from view (and the label to it tells handicapped visitors to 
leave it empty).  Sorry I should have been more clear on that!  It does 
use CSS to "hide" it - but if it were automated in any way, then it'd be 
filled in.

I suppose you could even turn that field into a joke, and give it some 
kind of false name to make spammers even more likely to fill it in..so 
they don't just see a blank input field.

Like I said, this is something I've wanted to *try* for a while, just 
never took the time to do it.  Now I'm wondering if it would work :)

None of these solutions will work for long. It's incredibly easy to work
around them, unless they're dynamic.

WP-Spamfree could easily be beaten by faking the cookie. Although that could
be beaten by having the cookie value be a salted hash of their IP or
something. Problem is then no one with cookies or JS disabled (tons of
people run noscript) could comment. Not sure on % of people who are like
that though.

As for hidden inputs, it's trivial to ignore type="hidden" inputs -- just
load the HTML and parse it (more work, I know, but still easy). Hiding the
field via CSS would work a lot better.

Personally though, I don't care. I have an incredibly beefy server (so I can
handle the hits) and Defensio is currently sitting at 99.94% recent
accuracy. Since the 23rd, I've gotten 26375 spams, 185 legit, 16 missed
spams, and 10 falsely marked as spam. No Bad Behavior (too many false
positives) or anything else.**

I haven't had it occur on WP, but I have had it occur on WPMU if I haven't
visited the write options page and hit save (i.e. default category).

Dunno if the two are related or not though, but we definitely shouldn't be
creating categories with a "1" as their name, regardless of why.

My conclusion from this is:

Because you do something that almost no one else does, and your site is 
not a large enough target, spammers have not yet done the trivial 
workaround it would require to get past this. If it was put into core, 
they most certainly would.

So, continue to do this if it helps, just don't tell anyone. ;)

 From 2002:

http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/29/club_vs_lojack_solutions

"The really interesting thing about these approaches, from a game theory 
perspective, is that they are all Club solutions, not Lojack solutions. 
There are two basic approaches to protecting your car from theft: The 
Club (or The Shield, or a car alarm, or something similiar), and Lojack. 
The Club isn?t much protection against a thief who is determined to 
steal your car (it?s easy enough to drill the lock, or just cut the 
steering wheel and slide The Club off). But it is effective protection 
against a thief who wants to steal a car (not necessarily your car), 
because thieves are generally in a hurry and will go for the easiest 
target, the low-hanging fruit. The Club works as long as not everyone 
has it, since if everyone had it, thieves would have an equally 
difficult time stealing any car, their choice will be based on other 
factors, and your car is back to being as vulnerable as anyone else?s. 
The Club doesn?t deter theft, it only deflects it.

"Similarly, installing a secret form field on your comment form will 
stop spammers from spamming your comments, until enough people do that 
that it?s worth the spammer?s time to upgrade their scripts. Ditto 
referer hacks (just set the referer); ditto registration schemes (just 
auto-register); ditto time limits (just hit each weblog sequentially). 
Ditto ditto ditto."

If possible nonces may be great - agree but i am not too sure if they would
be realy help or just increase server load on the long term because spammers
would start to crawl the page every time...

As to my experiments so far the contact form of each blog will be loaded at
least once or once a day, many seem to do it every 2 hours (as far as I can
tell this depends on the spammer himselfe or his software). There may be
some left which do not load it even a single time but they seem to be rare.

How I can tell?
I tried the following:
<input type="hidden" name="some_name" value="<?php echo my_hash_function();
?>" />

While the my_hash_function creates a hash depending on several factors
including post id, hour and date and some not informations not available to
public.
When the comment is posted this hash will be evaluated against the hash
which would be used now and the hash used last hour.

It seems obvious that no spam will go through this if the spammer didn't
load the form within this or the last hour. Whoever wants to write a comment
needs to do it within 1.5 hours at average, differing from 1 to 2 hours,
after page load. However this only decreased spam - there is plenty spam
left anyway which will have to be catched by other plugins.

I stole that code however by another plugin (which I didn't want to use as a
whole for performance issues) so the footprint may be known to spammers
allready and they are aware of it and react when it is inside the form when
they first load it.

I think the best guess is not to write any tool which will leave a clear
footprint such as a specific name for a form field. And if your example
would be a often used plugin the spammers would start sending that 1 or
whatever anyway, nomatter if needed or not. If that random name would be
different from blog to blog they would load the form one time for each blog
- if it would be different from post to post they'd load each post one
time... if it differs from time to time they would simply load it in that
time intervall

The thing I want to mention is:
Preventing spam on a not so valuable blog (valuability measured as spamers
do)  is quite easy - you only need to do something which is uncommon.
Preventing spam on a more valuable blog (which spammers would work or pay
for being able to spam it again) is a bit harder since you must be
obfuscating enough for them not to know how the algo works.
While preventing spam with a plugin which will be widely spread is quite
difficult because it needs something a spammer is not possible to hack no
matter if he knows the algo or not. (And he will know it if you make it
available to public)

Maybe using nounces - which would limit the use to a defined time and a
defined "user" (you'd need to identify by IP or Cookie) and a defined post
and only one comment - may be like shooting yourselfe in the foot, cause
they would have to load the page every time, which they might do if that
plugin is widely spread. But that is only a vague guess.

I simply can not imagine them stopping to spam WordPress Blogs, no matter if
this would require the pages to be loaded or not, cause they seem to be
about 0.98 percent of current webpages.
Remember: There are some spam tools out there which even feature JavaScript
capabilities and solve grafphical captchas to trick anti-spam software...
Yes that all sounds pesimistic - but anyway when someone creates this tool
we will notice soon how spammers do react.

What I notice about the majority of my comment spam is that it  
typically includes dozens of links and line breaks (carriage  
returns).  Being new to PHP I don't (yet) know how to write a simple  
routine to examine each comment (using regular expressions, perhaps?)  
to simply not accept any that have more than a configurable number of  
links and or carriage returns.

I realize that Askimet is already trapping those with more than a set  
number of links, but I want to trash those with, say more than 5  
links total; not even pass them to Askimet.

Beyond that I think a layered approach is best.  Renaming the comment  
form (perhaps having a configuration option to due that in WP?),  
using a nonce, examining comment contents for number of links and/or  
carriage returns, requiring previews and IP matching the post with  
the preview, et cetera.

My tiny little site gets only a handful of comment spam daily, so  
far, but I am eager to find a solution that will grow with my site's  
ever increasing spam counts.

@code prole
you may try "spam karma 2" which uses a multilayered approach but it has
problems when your site gets havy load. (As I was told by Robert Basic from
basicthinking.de who lives from being a blogger afaik).

The thing is: No spams slip through it at my blog today. None. Basicly none
since about half a year or so. It even checks how long since page load and
stops them who where too fast. But then there are times where plenty get
into moderation and get closer and closer near the point they would have
been published instantly and you start optimising the configuration. I am at
a point today where I get only about 1-2 spams per day into moderation queue
but I don't think this will last a long time, in a month or two it will be
10 or 20 if i belive the trend.
And there is not much room left to get the spam prevention more tight via
sk2.

I am nearly sure Matt is right saying only custom and umknown techniques
will help in the long term - at least until some genious has any idea which
will be uncrackable by spiders and not annoying visitors.

I'm well aware that it's not a viable solution for everybody, that
much is obvious. Iw as even aware that it was not a new technique. I
was simply stating what I found out and the state of the current
spambots as I have seen them.

I had not read that club vs. lojack solution thing before. It's
interesting. But it also indicates that apparently not enough people
are using clubs to make drilling through them worthwhile for the
spammers to do, or at least, to do very often. Drilling through a
hidden form field blocker is trivial, of course, but after over a
month, nobody seems to have bothered.

You're basically correct that if it was in the core code, then it
would be easy enough to bypass, all that has to happen is for the
spammers to load the comment forms up before submitting to them like a
browser would. This would increase load on systems because of the
added page generation and such.

I don't know of a particularly good lojack solution, obviously. I can
think of some ways to do it.

Idea: when spam comes in and is confirmed to be spam, block the IP
from that site for a time period. All access to the site from that IP,
blocked with instant 403. If this gets to enough sites, then rather
rapidly the spammers can't send spam anymore. Problem: Blowback.
Spammers will effectively shut down these sites for dynamic IP users
who happen to get one of those IPs. Plus side: it will encourage ISPs
not to allow spammers onto their networks at all and to take more
proactive measures against this sort of thing.

Anybody else got any other lojack ideas?

What about this one?

I suppoee tons of updates didn't change SECRET_KEY.

If iI undesrstood right even with no secret key getting an hig level

The question is, secret key setting is a mandatory task? If yes would

It's for a plugin (ImageManager). When/where should I call it. I tried doing
it in a method called by init, but it didn't work.

I just did a completely fresh install of the WP 2.5 download and tried 
this, with a completely new database.  What I did:

a) Created two pages (from Write / Page)

b) Went to Manage / Pages, clicked on a page to edit it (you can't 
assign a page parent directly on Manage Pages that I can see), and 
assigned a page a parent

c) Went to Manage / Categories. There is no problem. Only the default 
"uncategorized" category is there.

Maybe you have a plugin that screwed things up? Or the database had 
something odd in it from a previous install?

I've used this "honeypot" technique in some forms, and it's pretty 
effective.  Giving it a name that most bots will recognize (such as 
"email") will increase it's success rate.  Also, in case CSS doesn't 
hide it, I give it a label like "If you are a real person, please leave 
this blank"

Lastly, you have to verify that the field was submitted, but blank.  
This helps to assure that your form was used, and filled in properly.

Try hooking it onto admin_head. That should be early enough and yet late enough.

It would be nice if somebody had mentioned this somewhere. I didn't
even know about this until just now. And I had to search through the
code to find out what it does.

The one thing most people do not change is their wp-config.php file. I
had no idea stuff had been added to it to enable this sort of thing.

When 2.5 was realeasedI didn't se any advice about the NEED to make
this secret key.

If I understood the report on secuity focus without that KEY the
password si as strong as before.. or im worng? The new method and the
KEY ad an extra secutiry but they are not mandatory.

When you talk about IP Adresses please be aware that there are huge bot nets
which were previously used for email.
You may force spammers to use them for commentspam too...
then you have x thousands of enemies which make use of dynamic IPs...
and no one will have to worry about more bandwith then, cause its not the
spammers then.

Wow - of all the people, Otto, I figured you'd be all over that :)  I 
made *sure* to add a "Secret key" in my wp-config file when I did all my 
upgrades.  Maybe I'm anal.

I didn't know what it was for though, but I figured it was for a good 
reason, so I did it.  (It does say it's not necessary, though.)

What *is* it for, anyway?

It is a hashing salt that is not readable through the database.  "And  
what is a salt?"  A salt is something that adds randomness to a hash  
input and makes it much harder to crack.  For example:

In these examples, consider that the password is "test", but that the  
cracker does not know this (indeed, this is what he's trying to  
determine).  And yes, I'm glossing over some stuff, but this is the  
simplistic explanation.

Easy to crack: md5('test');

Since 'test' is a short dictionary word, crackers who have the output  
hash can easily use rainbow tables (dictionary lookup table) to crack  
that password in seconds, or minutes.

Harder to crack: md5('test' . $known_salt);

In this case, the cracker has to generate a new rainbow table that  
adds the $known_salt value to their table's hashes.  This slows them  
down.

Even harder to crack: md5('test' . $unknown_salt);

In this case, they don't know the salt.  And since a good salt is  
something very random, like "888a7da62429ba6ad3cb3c76a09641fc" -- they  
can't use rainbow tables to help them.  They have to just "brute  
force" their way through all the possible combinations.  This is a  
huge hurdle.  Something that might take 10 minutes before could now  
take years.

We have a couple options here:

1. Spread the word and encourage people to add it.
2. Have a "nag" in wp-admin that generates a random salt, prints the  
define('SECRET_KEY', $random_salt); line and tells you to add it to wp- 
config.php
3. Try to automatically add the SECRET_KEY define() to wp-config.php  
and fall back to #2 if we cannot.

#1 is going to result in very few people utilizing the feature.  #2 or  
#3 is probably the way to go.

This has been a discussion on UDWEB today, but I thought you all might  
be mildly interested since: A. It's (of course) WordPress MU. and B.  
It's scary that splogs may be moving into .EDU.

I wrote about it quickly at:

Thanks for the help Otto, but I can't manage to make it work. I think I've
tried any possible (feels like it at least :) combinations:

By itself (i.e. when my  plugin is loaded) i.e.:
  remove_action( 'media_buttons', 'media_buttons' );
// or
  remove_action( 'init', 'media_buttons' );
// or
  remove_action( 'admin_head', 'media_buttons' );

In a routine hooked by add_action('init','MYROUTINE')
In a routine hooked by add_action(' plugins_loaded ','MYROUTINE')

function MYROUTINE() {
  remove_action( 'media_buttons', 'media_buttons' );
// or
  remove_action( 'init', 'media_buttons' );
// or
  remove_action( 'admin_head', 'media_buttons' );

}

I like all of the above. Step 1, nag the user with a yellow box, like
with an upgrade (You need to create a secret key!). Step 2, give them
a page linked from said yellow box to generate one and save it
automatically or present it to them and have them do it themselves.
Should simply be a good long random string.

Okay, I'll be more clear...

function removestuff() {
remove_action( 'media_buttons', 'media_buttons' );
}
add_action('admin_head','removestuff');

Thank you Otto, this worked :) .. it will be implemented in the next
ImageManager version (i.e. v2.5.3)

this is mostly what I do, however at the firefall/iptables level:

the latest fashion seems to be botnet-powered comment/trackback spam, so 
if you block the corresponding lusers with a mobilising message they may 
actually grab an antivirus and clean their machines, so you're helping 
save the world :D

> Anybody else got any other lojack ideas

instead of just DROP-ing the connections at the firewall, I believe one 
can set it to allow the handshake to occur, then drop anything coming 
from the internet and send RST to Apache to abort the connection;

or (my latest evil thought) set up a bunch of scripts like:

<evil script>
<?php
sleep(30);
header('HTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporarily');
header('Location: /my/other/script.php');
?>
I am afraid your target has moved. Again.
</evil script>

and have them redirect in a circle (perhaps even with random switching 
between them) >:D
Most spam bots implement HTTP incompletely, but they usually do follow 
redirects; now, I need to see how I can put this in a nice graphical 
display like http://xkcd.com/350/

Even better, why not use your secret key (with salting)? I think it 
could be a viable solution for core, because the name of the field would 
change for each installation.

I'd guess that the index of something is "1" and that is being used as 
the category.

Message-ID: <4806CF5F.8060006@santosj.name>

This thread is full of WTF?s. I'll number them off for you.

1. Ryan has stated many times the purpose of SECRET_KEY, blogged about 
it. Peter Westwood also had to of mentioned it many times before also on 
his weekly SVN report.

I apologize, because really don't know how many of you track the trac 
mailing list or look at the SVN or read the Peter Westwood's weekly SVN 
report. If you don't know where the weekly SVN report is, then I would 
guess you start at westi.wordpress.com and see if you can find it from 
there.

I've been out of touch with the SVN and Trac mailing lists, so I've come 
across very interesting topics, which would have very much interested 
me. So I can understand if all you do is follow the mailing list, you 
can miss a lot of good information.

I could also swear that there was a codex page on this information. 
Damn, the pluggable.php file in the wp-includes folder can easily be 
copied to the codex, since the documentation is GPL.

I'm not sure that you can spread the word well enough, unless it was 
built in to the administration. I think, if anything, it should just do 
it for you with no fuss and involvement from the user.

2. Um, who said it isn't important to change the SECRET_KEY and why is 
that person still breathing?

Change the SECRET_KEY setting! As soon as possible, do it now! It is 
very important to change the SECRET_KEY setting from the default. Okay, 
after checking documentation, I realize that it was me. However, I 
specifically state that it is not required only if it is NOT DEFINED in 
wp-config.php, which it is on new installations for 2.5.

Also, you may define SECRET_SALT, which is not defined in wp-config.php 
by default and will be generated by WordPress. This means that even if 
you don't change the SECRET_KEY, you will be likewise protected from 
yourself.

Those who are paranoid, like me, can define one or both.

3. What about actually allowing it to be defined at installation?

I know that yeah, the installation should only be five minutes and as 
easy as pie, but hey, you can randomize the process for the user and the 
power users can change it for themselves.

The only problem with defining the SECRET_KEY and/or SECRET_SALT on the 
installation or by a web page on the administration is that most 
WordPress applications are sent through HTTP and not HTTPS.

It would be another WTF, if you send what is supposed to be a secret 
over the net in plaintext. However, much can be said by sending the 
actual password over the net in plaintext, but we'll leave that out of 
the discussion for the sake of keeping our sanity.

4. Sigh, sometime it would be a good idea to create a phpdocumentor site 
for WordPress.

You know, there is something said about having inline documentation. 
There is something else to be said about having it searchable and where 
users actually feel comfortable viewing it. In the past, I had planned 
on creating a phpDocumentor site, but I had always felt it was something 
that should be on WordPress.org and not on one of my sites that hardly 
anyone will go to, until they find out about it and actually do start 
going to it.

The only problem with phpDocumentor sites is that they are more 
technical, so end users and even most developers who could care less 
don't wish to wade through all of it to find the one function they need.

The only goal of the phpDocumentor site is to provide up-to-date web 
documentation about functions, which could then in turn be linked from 
the codex to the function page on the phpDocumentor site. It doesn't 
make sense to have function documentation on the codex, where with each 
passing version that the function is not updated means that the greater 
the chance that the information on the codex is inaccurate.

Besides, where better to make a change to the documentation than right 
there where the change is being made? I don't like finding the function 
in the codex and I would very much like it better to have everything 
automated. Why should I write the same information twice? I'm just not 
going to do it.

I think where codex authors go wrong is that the codex should describe 
in English (or whatever language) how to use the functions, instead of 
what the properties are and what the function does.

That is all I can think of at the moment. Thank you for taking the time 
to read my ranting. However, for such a small thread, so many WTF?s 
should not be acceptable.

+1 to #2 and #3 sound the best and logical solution.

When it is possible to include that secret into wp-config without the user
noticing it, it would be possible to do this with a randomly created one
too. It wouldn't be hard to generate a (random lengt) phrase of between 10
to 15 random chars or whatever.

If there is any notice to do that within the installation dialog I didn't
read it - if there is none how should one know to do it?
You know there is an installation because one will not want to do everything
by hand. You can not expect anyone to know that he/she will have to do
anything for it.

While members of wp-hackers mailing list may have noticed while reading the
trac mailing list or the SVN Report (which of course isn't really required
to be on this list), normal users can not be expected to know this.

it is the "default category" which will be assigned to a post whenever the
post has not category. Its default value is 1 - if that category doesn't
exist a new category with the name of the default categorys id will be
created as far as I know.

because spammers will know this after a week or less.
They will start loading the page every second full hour and therefore they
will allways have the possibility to spam you again.
The only thing which will change is that you do not have to fight the spam
only but will also have much more hits on your post pages.

This is like kicking your own ass. If you implement a detectable and
crackable solution via core the only thing which happens is more load on
your server - first for the security addon and second for the higher traffic
you get because spammers need to load the page before posting to it. I am
nearly sure it wouldn't hurt them badly to scan your page for the name and
the value of that field. And yes something like that secret key was used
before.

There were discussions about adding a field to the installation on Trac, 
but it was shot down as too "advanced" for users. The current automated 
definition relies on wp-config-sample.php, which has the constant and a 
comment to the constant. I had plans on creating a plugin, but I just 
totally forgot. Hey, even with the plugin it wouldn't probably get the 
word out that it can help you.

The problem is that the constant in wp-config-sample.php is that it does 
not change. Also, the problem with having it change based on modified 
type is that every time the SECRET_KEY changes, means that it will 
invalidate any current passwords. For each change the user will have to 
use the forgot password to get a new password and would have to change 
their password. I think once is okay, and I doubt that many plugins 
modify the wp-config.php, but it might be annoying for users to install 
a plugin and then not be able to login.

My secret key is longer than 15 characters, it is longer than 30 
characters, actually, my secret key is a secret phrase, which is 
completely humanly random and you would have to know me in order to 
understand what it is. I think if you are going to create a secret key, 
that it should be about 60 characters. Most of my passwords are between 
10 and 20 characters, because that is how many characters I can 
generally remember. You don't have to remember the secret key, you just 
need to define it once and forget about it.

The vector for attack on getting the SECRET_SALT is that if it is not 
defined in wp-config.php or elsewhere (like a plugin perhaps?) then it 
is within the database table. If a hacker were to somehow get into the 
database and view it, then the salt will become available. If the 
default SECRET_KEY is not changed, then the hacker will know both the 
SECRET_KEY and the SECRET_SALT. The steps to hack into the database are 
more difficult in WordPress 2.5.

Actually, from what I can see, the documentation in wp_salt() is no 
longer accurate or parts of it are incorrect, either because of a change 
in the function body or from code being located elsewhere and not 
readily available. I forget where the information that the SECRET_KEY 
will use the database information, but if it was changed (I was sure 
that code was also within pluggable.php), then SECRET_KEY must be 
defined or it will be an empty string. There are also grammar errors in 
the inline documentation.

I think this weekend I'm going to have to create a patch for correcting 
the incorrect information, however it most likely won't be of help to 
2.5.x users.

So is the following accurate?

1. For a new WordPress installation, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to replace the 
'put your unique phrase here' with your own SECRET_KEY phrase.

2. If you don't change the 'put your unique phrase here'  phrase, you are 
actually better off deleting the SECRET_KEY definition from wp-config.php.

3. For users upgrading from pre 2.5 versions, it is recommended to add the 
SECRET_KEY definition to wp-config.php after doing the upgrade.

4. And again, for upgrading users, if they don't add the SECRET_KEY 
definition to their existing wp-config.php, that is okay.

5.  At any time, you can change the SECRET_KEY value in wp-config.php and 
NOT cause problems when users log in with their existing password.

Thank you for your reply.

Ok 2 questions:

first: Why is it possible to fill in the database information but not a
random secret key in wp-config.php while installing - shouldn't that be
quite as easy? The key doesn't need to be setable by users - it could be set
via php with no user interaction - and therefor no transfer - needed.

second: Why the hack is the only thing I need to do after changing
SECRET_KEY logging in? I understand that what was saved in my cookie doesn't
validate anymore. I do not understand why I do not have to let the pass be
send via mail like I think you indicated with this:

while we all should be aware that human randomnes is not random enogh for
cryptografical issues. There are several weeknesses in human random strings.

You are of course right: more than 15 chars is better anyway, but I didn't
want to argue about length but about being able to randomly create a string
in the installer which sets a compleatly random passphrase which shouldn't
be of a fixed lenght.

The SECRET_KEY is used for the cookie hash, not for the password
hashing. Password hashing is done by the phpass class. The cookie hash
is MD5 of username + expiration + secret key + salt value.

No, that is not the case.  Having the default SECRET_KEY and having no
secret key end up with the same result, and it would be better to
leave it in there as a reminder to customize it later.

"Okay," but not good.  All WP users should have a custom SECRET_KEY to
reduce the risk of a security compromise.

No problems, but changing the SECRET_KEY will invalidate everyone's
cookies, forcing them to log in again.

Although you'd think blog spam is pretty similar accross the planet, I 
guess none of use is really experiencing the same kind of spam. I get 
*exactly* 0% trackback and 100% comments in my spam folder. Not a single 
trackback in the spam folder since Akismet showed spam type (for the 
record, I use BB & Akismet)

Bad Behavior is superb at eliminating Trackback spam. Turn it off for
a while, and see what happens.

After seeing the Simple Trackback Validation plugin, I switched off BB
and installed that, just to see what the difference would be.

yep it does - but only if this *is* existing. If it isn't existing it will
take its ID and use it as a name for a new category - do not ask me why as I
do not know, but it simply does.

Just to be clear...

Please correct me if I'm wrong (security is not my strong point):

We should be defining both SECRET_KEY and SECRET_SALT in wp-config.php.

They should both be filled with a completely random, and preferably  
long, string, e.g. 'i!Db)RO;wIhV%YU!PY,C@L7^Jb0*(8~A]2";J9<II`-FwF$Shi 
$&r60(\vH/'

They should NOT be the same, however.

Is this correct?

BB is nice, but I can't live with the false positives and blocking legit
users from my site.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp-denyhost
Message-ID: <00bf01c8a0e2$0b353ab0$219fb010$@no>

Hi,

I?ve written a plugin (not ready for release yet) that does the following:

define('PS_DENYHOST_THRESHOLD', 5);
function ps_denyhost() {
  global $wpdb;

  $suspect = $this->get_IP(); 
  $count = (int) $wpdb->get_var("SELECT COUNT(comment_ID) FROM
$wpdb->comments  WHERE comment_approved = 'spam' AND comment_author_IP LIKE
('%$suspect%')");

  if ($count > PS_DENYHOST_THRESHOLD) {
    exit; 
  }   
}
add_action('init', 'ps_denyhost');

The idea is that if a commenter has been tagged as a spammer more than
PS_DENYHOST_THRESHOLD times, he will be blocked.
The reason for PS_DENYHOST_THRESHOLD is to prevent a innocent commenter,
with comments wrongly tags as spam, from being block.

I guess there are similar plugins, but I couldn't find them.

Btw, I use this together with Akismet.

Comments?`

PerS

SECRET_SALT does not need to be defined.  Having one secret in the DB
instead of wp-config.php will prevent someone who somehow gets at your
wp-config.php (there have been some http server bugs that expose
files) from creating a cookie. Of course, if your DB is misconfigured
and allows connections from anywhere, someone who has wp-config.php
has your DB credentials and can get into your DB and change the
secret.

Random and long is good.  There are lots of random string generators around.

The documentation for a lot of the hashing and password functions are
incorrect and need to be updated, both in the source and there needs to be
a codex page that lists the information from this thread as well as
helpful tips.

I'm going to do the inline documentation this weekend, since it is very
important to have correct information. However, if there isn't a codex
page when I get to it, then I'll create one.

If someone creates a codex page, please post it to this thread, so that I
can find yours.

In the future, when there are changes to the core and patches don't
include documentation changes, it would be nice if the core developers can
proceed to do so. I say it would be nice, but really I mean you better do
it, lest the documentation go stale and you have a similar problem as you
would have if it was in the codex. That is except that it is right in
front of you, so there really isn't any excuse.

I say that and really what I mean is that patches and developers (core or
otherwise should correct and add documentation whenever possible).

I would go deeper and say stuff that wouldn't be acceptable, but I'll
leave that for a day when I'm actually right enough times. Right now it is
1 and 0 and not in my favor.

Ah a person can dream, a person can dream. Here is to a day when every
function is documented with mostly accurate information and when it would
actually be acceptable to say what I want to say. That would be good. Not
my complaining, but the fact that every function would be documented.

Except that with core developers and patches adding new functions that
don't have documentation, really causes the movement to go backwards,
which is terrible. I'll scream, I really will, if two years after every
function is documented, if there are just as many functions which aren't
documented.

A nice way of putting it, I think. I think that in two years, if my
prediction does come true and I seek to join the community once again,
I'll turn right around and join another project. However, there is much to
be done for documentation, so less complaining and more action.

It shouldn't let you delete the category in the first place if it's the 
default category...

Cool. Very cool indeed!

But maybe you could add an option to write this blocking to htaccess after
it was detected to be a "need to block" IP) - this would stop spammers from
even bothering to start the php
parser and to load the stuff wordpress loads before the init actions - when
they knock on the door apache would just throw an errorcode after
them and hopefully hit their head ;-)

|> It shouldn't let you delete the category in the first place if it's the

sure - it shouldn't and it won't let you - as long as you use WordPress Core
Stuff.
As soon as you use something inside a plugin this isn't magically given
anymore and when you're moving your database or whatever and it mixes up
that damn IDs the same will happen anyway.

To Clarify: I didn't say it was a bug - I only said it will happen if
you really have no category (or at least not the default one) existing any
more as this is what I understood Sabin Iacob said to have done:
Converting ALL Categories and being left without them.

I experienced this when I moved (or cloned to be precise) a blog and
something went wrong with the Categorie IDs. I do not blame WordPress for
that. If it was someones fault it's likely to be mine or the one of
phpMyAdmin, MySQL or whatever but not WPs. I managed to correct it within
half an hour or so - wasn't a big deal. But that was when I experienced WP
will create a new category with the name of its default cat-id whenever
that category doesn't exist. Maybe this isn't the case in WP2.5 anymore - I
don't know. But it may be related to that problem mentioned before and so I
thought I should maybe mention it - since the default category_id (of
course) defaults to 1 which was exactly the name of the category which was
added on their blogs.

There's plenty of strategies the least of which is not using java as  
the development lang. I can't see how doing an app in Java vs. any  
other language is any more or less cost effective - especially if it  
saves you the money in having to port a popular program to other  
platforms.

+1 to this. PHPDocs would be a welcome addition. I agree that the  
codex should exapand on the auto-created docs, and discuss how to use  
the functionality in "plain" english (or whatever language).

Considering that many spammer operations are either aided by their  
ISPs (Verio used to knowingly harbor spammers, and many of their IPs  
were bad for years), or are being sent out by zombied PCs (aka  
compromised home users) on their Local DSL/Cable ISP connections, I  
doubt that any ISP would be very fast in 'not allowing spammers' due  
to lack of available IPv4 addresses and the DHCP connections many of  
them use for their customers - at least because of apps employing IP  
blocking routines.

This might work (not tested :)

In .htaccess:
php_value auto_prepend_file suspect.php

suspect.php:
<?php
define('WP_USE_THEMES', false);
require('./wp-blog-header.php');

$suspect = $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"];
$count = (int) $wpdb->get_var("SELECT COUNT(comment_ID) FROM $wpdb->comments  WHERE comment_approved = 'spam' AND comment_author_IP LIKE ('%$suspect%')");

I understand your arguments. I do not remember the exact figures but more
than 90% of users in the world uses Windows platform. * nix is not a
commercial
platform unlike MAc. I know that you can say to me about *nix. But *nix
users are not accustomed to pay (holly war?). I can safely ignore any
platform except Windows.

Here's a similar technique, but this one scans for spammy IPs in both  
WP and MT installations spread across a server and adds those IPs to  
the firewall:

You should be using the = operator instead of LIKE.

Just think how many IP addresses match %4.12.32.1%, when presumably
you only want to match that single address.

Or at least 4.12.32.1%

You are both right, it was a bit late last night when I released this :) 

Personally, I'm going to use the first three octets e.g. 4.12.32.%, if you
are in the neighborhood of 4.12.32.1 (i.e. 4.12.32.*) it's your bad. 

The next version will use = instead of LIKE.

Living dangerously, eh?  Delegations smaller than /24 are common, and it
is not possible to freely pick your neighborhood on the Internet like
one can when bying a house.

Since you are parsing IP addresses, I'd like to mention IPv6.  Picking
octets can get a bit tricky with just regular expressions.

    beowulf.gw.com has address 204.80.150.34
    beowulf.gw.com has IPv6 address 2001:14b8:1ee::34

    pyry.gw.com has address 204.80.150.129
    pyry.gw.com has IPv6 address 2001:14b8:1ef:8000::226

This might work indeed but is totally overkill and offers no benefit from 
using a standard plugin: for any PHP page, including those that may not be 
WP related, you're including wp-blog-header.php with does all the WP init 
stuff including the 5 to 7 minimum SQL queries, plus all the extra queries 
triggered by plugins.

A slightly more efficient way would be not to include wp-blog-header.php 
and to query directly wp_comments without using the $wpdb object (thus 
making one SQL query only)

What would be even more efficient is that a function within the plugin 
would hardcode "deny from $ip" in the .htaccess itself, maybe with a grace 
period, or limited to latest XXX ips to prevent oversized .htaccess files

I usually dislike the method of IP blocking. In Germany, a lot of internet
providers (at least the biggest, Deutsche Telekom) do assign dynamic IP
addresses and usually disconnect the connection each 24 hours.

Therefore a bot PC will have a different IP each 24 hours and will happily
fill your database with both comment spam - and after the threshold is
reached with unallowed IP addresses.

Additionally more and more users are blocked from legal commenting if your
plugin does not release the IP ban after a while.

Not to mention spam botnets usually have tons of IP addresses.

IP blocking isn't worth the trouble IMO.

It's completely up to you what platforms you support, however, if you want
the application to be successful and accessible for as many WordPress users
as possible you must support all thre major operating systems.

> I can say what my comment client is new unique application.

I don't think that'll cut the proverbial mustard around here I'm afraid.
Screenshots and a feature list would be useful, which would encourage more
testers/users, and cross platform support would definitely increase your
future userbase.

To be honest, I'm still none the wiser as to:

   1. What the UI actually looks like
   2. What features the application actually has

What I really want to know is, what does it achieve that isn't already
possible by running the comments admin pages in Prism [1], or the Mac
alternative - I've forgotten the name of it sorry! If I had that information
I'd be happy to try it out and report back.

The idea behind this plugin is to prevent more comment spam for a commenter
that has already been tagged as a spammer (tagged by Akismet). I logged this
for 1 hour last night and got this (this is just a few of them): 

[number of comments tagged as spam] IP address

[148] 208.53.147.118
[231] 195.225.178.15
[211] 195.225.176.177

I totally agree that my "pseudo" code is an overkill, a trimmed PHP script
is needed. In real life I might use RewriteMap[1] in http.conf, and stop the
spammer there.

whatever you do with this - when you start loading php parser for it you may
as well not do it.
you know there is no benefit at all when you
1. start php parser for htaccess
2. start php parser for wordpress
every time a visitor hits a page.
This would (maybe as I do not know if there is any caching within apaches
.htaccess treatment) even slowdown images and css files loading.

The trick would be to hardcode it - well it might be oversized then - I am
not to sure about how fast apache does parse htaccess.


Coming to IP Blocking:
It is very unlikly one will create more then X spams with the same ip if he
has no static one - at least this is what I read out of my logs.
They spam my blog from the same IP adress month long - triggering about 500
spams average till today, while botnet/dynamic IP spam only does 2 or 3
spams from the same IP.

Maybe the value of 5 is to low to only filter real spammers but since I
clean the comments table every second month (moving spam to a seperate table
for logging purposos) I don't think there will be many false positives.

Besides since I am living in germany and am not getting much spam from
german IP's I think the risk having spammers in dynamic IP ranges is not
such great today - while it will surely rise withing the next cuple of
month. I do not belive they will risk being filtered by "to many comments
per day, IP and blog" so there will be none to only very few false positives
when you set the deny value high enogh (10 should do the trick).

I am using comment IP blacklisting for a while now and never got any
complains.

Several million AIX, Solaris, SCO, Novell, RedHat and Irix users just
had infarctions at that comment.

And just because we believe that software should be Libre doesn't mean

At your peril.  You'll find that, like first person shooter
developers, most people with CPU cycles to spare and servers to donate
to your cause run some flavor of UNIX (likley a Linux or BSD variant).
 It's about mindshare amongst the community literati, really.

why not? what if I don't want categories, period? you don't have to 
delete it, btw, turning all categories into tags will have the same effect.

I think Alexander was trying to say that you could, for example, append 
the offending IP to a rewrite map file and have .htaccess block 
addresses that match (requires access to server config); or just insert 
"deny from" entries into the htaccess file (there is a function 
somewhere in the Wordpress core that does the insert between markers 
thing, but I forgot how it's called :o))

Prism actually looks pretty cool, and contrary to what that page states it
is available for Linux, or at least for Ubuntu Hardy...
Thanks for the link, that'll actually save me a lot of time with test
projects I'm trying to hack around on, and it's all from a nice open source
company :)

because today WordPress doesn't support posts without categories...
btw. remove any hint to categories from your theme and you wouldn't have to
care in which category the posts are stored nor if there is any meaning in
the name ;-)

I know its just a workaroung and I simply do not understand why each post
needs to have a categorie - but it is simply that way today and I do not
know why someone would do work for changing that, because you do not need to
use the categories assigned in any way.

I forgot write what I mean home users like bloggers. These users not buying
software for home. This is real fact. I known many developers companies
which makes money on Windows applications and they sai what market end-users
solutions is dead. May be in future... I will be wait. I have too many ideas
for my another projects and not enough time and money for unix clones.

I am thinging what donate model will be not wwork for my application. My
application isnt a server solution. Target group for my client is end-users.
Of course this topic is very interesting.
am not familiar with any one person who makes money on developing programs
for Unix. But I am familiar with several hundred mans ho makes money on
Windows applications. Maybe I do not live there need and isnt familiar with
the right people? This is rhetorical question.

Dunno what others do, but whenever I like a snipplet of code (especially for
server-side of course, since I am more of a serverside-dev then an
desktop-application-dev (while writing cobol programms at work which run as
desktop solutions) and I find a donation button I will donate (small pices
of money as I am not rich and find many usefull snipplets).

If there is some pice of software which is really usefull for my purposes I
will buy it - no matter if open source or closed.

I am running windows - so this is nothing which really says something about
the "home users running linux" but I do not think the mentality is really
different. I just do not have the time for maintaining two OSes (I'd need a
windows for some apps anyway) while I am sure linux is one of the best OSes
available - so do not try bothering with any religious wars as I see both
sides but do not get every app I need running on linux.

The thing is: I will pay for whatever software I use (for a longer period) -
if it is open source and available for free or not. I am sure I am not the
only one - but I am also sure that there are many who don't.

Anyway: If Vladimir isn't a cross platform dev trying him to work cross
platform will not make the software woth a penny. When he codes in (insert
language of your choice) and can not get that programm running on mac or
linux it is just that. He will not start learning java just to provide the
same for mac and linux - this is time consuming and I know what it means to
have plenty of ideas and not enogh time to work on every single one. You'll
start dropping things which aren't YOUR need or wish. And so he does: He
drops platform independence for having more time to write code for ms
windows users - which still is a very large group.

I'd say stop religious wars and start accepting that not everything will be
published for every operating system. I am left without glorious TextMate
since I am not running Mac OS - well I of course hat that situation, but
there is nothing which can be done beside searching for alternatives. Noone
bothers Microsoft for creating a linux compatible version of MS Office -
why? Because there is a great open source alternative (OO.org)?

Any chance that Automattic could host a phpxref of trunk and latest
stable? I've been using http://xref.redalt.com/wptrunk/nav.htm every
day for years and it's finally stopped updating (dec 6). It's pretty
easy to do (at least statically) and is extremely useful for figuring
out code flow (it also displays the documentation really nicely on the
summary pages when it's present).

This has been already asked here about 6 months ago (can't find the 
thread) and as far as I remember I think that westi said something like 
"I'll do something" (is it vague enough ?:)

This would be a cheap (CPU/BW wise) but priceless (code wise) service to 
host, indeed.

You forgot mobile devices and others blog engines such as blogger.com and
livejournal.com. I can quickly extent my application for blogger.com and
livejournal.com and perhaps for others blog engines. But not other operating
systems. I created application for 2 months.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp support channels
Message-ID: <4808BA0E.5050702@timbury.net>

Greetings, all.

I've got a small project I'm trying to complete, involving
the creation of a blog widget, similar to SpringWidgets,
which can be used on any site (myspace, blogspot, etc)
to display latest post summaries from a wp blog. I've
described this in more detail and provided some code
in the wordpress.org forum a day ago. As yet, no replies.

Other than the forum, what other channels exist for
support? I subscribe to this list and wp-pro; is there
a wp-support mailing list? An irc channel? Thanks.

For those interested, the forum post is here:

You're perfectly right. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a comment client made only for Windows, it's the author's choice.


Now supposing that there IS a person who might be willing to write a free, open-source, and cross-platform comment manager for WordPress, what would members of this list like to see supported/implemented in such a project?

We (NST) have been looking into ideas for open-source, cross-platform, desktop-based projects that add value to existing OS systems for a number of intern-like positions, and this seems like a good one...

I should have known something like this will happen (maybe I *did* know
it...) ;-)

My main wish would be extendability - I have a seperate spam logging table
where not only the comment but also the reasons why it was "junked" are in -
I would really wish something to analize them in a fast and(!) flexible
way... every thing else is easy with wordpress itselfe.

But I could use it for editing comments as well (especially with one of my
projects I will have to edit every single comment, cause I'll set up a
multilingual WP and really want the comments to be translated too, whenever
they deal with a support question (which will require me translating them
and adding some sort of shortcodes there as well but will stop me from
answering the same question multiple times in different languages). I have
no particular Idea how to make this much easier - but you could add
configurable buttons which will work someway like quickbuttons / tinymce
buttons...

That sounds like the sort of thing I would have offered and forgotten 
about :-(

I've just set it up [1] with hourly updates.

The current location is temporary and it may have to more depending on 
the bandwidth usage etc.

Wasn't meant to put the blame on you at all, and I may be completely wrong 
about who said (if anyone ever did) they would set one up :)

joo roole. Thanks a lot!

Next step: http://wpxref.wordpress.org/trunk/ and 
http://wpxref.wordpress.org/latest/, I'll just pretend I remember Matt 
saying he would set it up, it seems like it's working sometimes ;)

I've put a link to this new site on the Developer Documentation and 
Function Reference pages of the Codex. Anywhere else it should go? 
Those are the two places I knew of that linked to the Redalt xref, as 
well as another site that seems to track the latest released version 
of WordPress.

Hello all.

After reading the whole thread, here now my two cent and thoughts on the
topic...

First of all, I think that this plugin is a great idea. I am using
something  like that (with a similar name ;) ) for protecting my sshd.

The usage of .htaccess-files limits and binds you to apache. But there are
alternative and mostly even more efficient web-servers around, and many of
them don't bother with .htaccess-files. Relying on these files it a very
bad behavior for a "program" that is written in a language like PHP which
implies a certain independence of architecture and system. Especially when
talking about software like web-servers, the freedom of choice should be
encouraged, and I do not talk about the freedom of choice about using or
not using the plugin, but the freedom to use any web-server I want or
need.

Myself, I am using lighttpd as a webserver, and it doesn't care about
.htaccess. There are no possibilities of on-the-fly blocking by using any
kind of server-configuration-file that is read upon access to a certain
directory. lighttpd reads its config upon startup, and then never again.
This approach has advantages as well as disadvantages and might be
discussed elsewhere, but considering the current discussion-thread,
webservers like this should not be ignored. Especially, when thinking
about high-load web-servers, which very often use alternative web-servers.

These web-servers are left with two choices:
 - Using PHP for blocking, which would work on any web-server supporting
   PHP.
 - using /etc/hosts.deny for those, who use tcpwrappers, which are probably
   only a few.

For those servers who can make use of /etc/hosts.deny, a way needs to be
found to access that file, since hopefully the web-server- and
php-processes are not allowed to do that. A separate daemon could this,
which would have the responsibility of removing the addresses again,
whenever they approach the "ttl". This would even be faster than the
.htaccess-method, as hosts.deny would result in a "connection refused"
message - as if there would be no server listening on the requested port.

For those requiriung the use of PHP for blocking, a lightweight-script
should probably be used, as it has already been discussed in this thread.

Some ideas for such a lightweight-script:

- To avoid the php-parser to run, one can use a php-accelerator like xcache.
  It caches the compiled version of a php-script and uses that whenever it
  is accessed without being changed on disc in-between. As it is a
  php-plugin, it works transparently on any web-server-software.

- Having several php-processes already in-waiting for serving request, e.g.
  by using something like fastcgi or similar

- Using memcached for storing the ip-adresses.
  memcached can be used to store and retrieve the ip-addresses faster as a
  database, and it has the advantage of sitewide-availability, which is a
  bit more difficult to achieve by direct database access. While this is
  irrelevant for a standard WordPress installation, WordPress MU
  installations would benefit from quite a lot.
  To ensure the lightweightness, the connection-information for the
  memcached-access could be needed to be provided directly into given
  variables in the first few lines of the script.
  This, of course, needs to be sufficiently documented in the install-docs,
  and could only be done by a site-admin.

If you could make it run under Wine on Linux it wouldn't require an
entirely new language just a couple tweaks. I'm testing it on Linux
now, and I'm finding that anything I put into fields is trimmed to
only a couple letters.

Okay, so we don't have Adobe AIR on mobile devices yet, but Adobe are
working towards that [1].

I don't think you understood me right...

The benefits of using Adobe AIR are that you write the application once and
it works for many operating systems. It's up to you what your application
does, support as many blog hosts as you want. Adobe AIR is merely a
development framework which will allow you to run the same application on
any operating system AIR itself is installed on.

I just purchased glorious TextMate, using funds I got from the tip jar  
on my web site.  :)

I don't know where I saw the page, but there is a Windows program out  
there that is looking like "TextMate for Windows".  It is not made by  
the same guys, nor does it have all the same features; but notably, it  
does **support TextMate bundles**.

Sorry I can't give you a name.  "somethingEdit" or the like.  Just  
letting you know it's out there.

[ Google is my friend -- it's called E-Text Editor.  Still in beta:

I understood you completed. When I wrote about mobile devices I had hoped
that my humor harmless and easy to be understood. I didnt joke about others
blog engines. Sorry.

My applications have many platforms depended modules such as supports
drag&drop, virtual files in the clipboard, interthread synchronization,
manage multi top level windows, preview comments in hint window and more. I
known what features of my application can be transfered to another platform.
Possible create same appication with semilar features but never new
application can be compared with original. I hope what I wrong.

Good thoughts.

> one can use a php-accelerator like xcache
yep but that isn't something a plugin has to deal with. Code optimization
and stuff has nothing to do with the benefit you can gain with such stuff -
anyway you will not have this with shared hosting wich is where most WP
Blogs are.

>Relying on these files it a very bad behavior for a "program" that is
written in a language like PHP
Who says anything about relying upon it? I ment after X Spammy-Comments
WordPress will be loaded again from the same IP Adress. In the 'init'-Hook
the Plugin blocks access and adds a new deny rule to .htaccess. If
htaccess-option is turned off it wouldn't do this anyway. So it will block
it in the init section everytime it isn't stopped by .htaccess. The only
thing I said is: Blocking it at that - directly via WordPress accessable -
level will stop php parser from having to load and will stop php to go until
running the init-hook and the specifical plugin is called.

But coming back to your server:
When this script would add the stuff to .htaccess this would result in no
difference at all to *not* adding it there because it would block the
connections with php anyway.

If you say writing a lightweight script:
Where would you like to add that? In index.php as the first line would work
- any later point is everything but not leightweigt.

Yes there are many different Servers around, and maybe you can not write a
plugin to fit them all perfectly but for each server one could write one
plugin fitting it perfectly well. Anyway: Stuff which will require an extra
deamon will be a bit of an overkill with the spam of today. If spammers
start visiting your page every 2 sec's or whatever this will of course be an
issue to be discussed but today it really isn't that bad as far as I know.

I prefer TextEdit for Windows, but the FOSS Notepad++ is also great.

+1 for Notepad++ on Windows. I am surprised at how easy it works for
my programming needs.

>Notepad++ is also great.
you bet - I used it until I discovered e - which is even a bit greater I
think...

Anyway I have it installed as a second editor and as a third one I use VIM
(beat me - its great too - opened up a 800+ MB file a while ago and was able
to work with it - do this with any other editor and the editor will die ;-)

Knowing there are many who would start religious wars about which editor is
best - I haven't found a single editor fitting all my needs. e is great
since it features TextMate Bundles and Themes, is fully costumisable and you
can code your own commands in any language you like (ruby, perl, phyton,
shell via cygwin, php runs best via windows since every php installation on
cygwin seems to have some problems)

Notepad++ is great for Search in Files, its stability is higher (will crash
less often) and it seems to be a bit faster, but I am not sure about that
point. It features extensions (while I have no Idea yet how to build them)
and is themeable too.

VIM is a very reliable editor with huge power - but its just a mess to have
to know all that commands ;-) (while you shouldn't forget you'll get damn
fast when you know them. We're writing clients/server cobol applications
with vim at work.) It is configurable but configuration is a real mess -
you'll have to learn VIMs own language for it.

Intype is also a Editor trying to simulate TextMate while this one doesn't
need cygwin. Its Alpha however and still not very reliable. I won't use
alpha stuff for production.

TextEdit for Windows yet is a tool I do not really know - I installed it to
give it a try but it simply didn't let me change the look within 5 minutes
of searching (I will never try something longer if it doesn't fit my basic
requirements)... I simply can not work with an editor with a white
background - no way. Maybe I just looked at the wrong place so I'd be happy
to head it is themeable and give it a second try then.

Iam allways in search for good and fast texteditors (just leave me alone
with any slow IDE shit, just plain text + commands + autocompleat + ... on
demand and preferable extendable without needing a specific language - thats
what I got with e at least and I will not change backwards...)

>I am surprised at how easy it works for my programming needs.
since this really depends upon your needs... well your lucky. I was allways
searching for just a bit more - you know this little tick that would make
something perfect ;-) I found this tick in e - now the only thing it needs
is e becomeing somewhat more stable... but I'll be open for any further
ideas anyway

Subject: [wp-hackers] De-emphasize use of ID values in functions?
Message-ID: <161617690804181457x6d9435b8y5109f63f3f857aed@mail.gmail.com>

Somebody on the forums brought up a good point today. A lot of the
functions are still very geared towards use of ID numbers. Post IDs,
category IDs, etc.

However, WordPress itself moved away from that a bit in 2.5, with the
removal of the ID numbers from the admin space.

Any plans/ideas/thoughts about making these functions geared more
towards names/slugs? I mean, the functions using IDs must be meant for
the end-user to do theme modification, because generic theme
developers won't know the individual IDs on the sites using the
themes.

Another way to go would be to make it easier for theme developers to
provide administrative pages (theme options) to allow for people to
choose posts/pages/categories/whatever and then produce the ID's to
plug into the proper places on the themes. I like this idea, but am
not as certain about the right way to do this sort of thing, or what
sort of functions would help theme developers in this respect.

It's been discussed here before too, but may I suggest you add 
anything relevant to http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6315 ? Hacker's 
List discussions don't have much traction, in terms of getting things 
done in WP.

Another Notepad++ to e convert here. I'm absolutely addicted to
bundles/snippets; it feels like my productivity would completely crumble if
I went back to any other editor. I love it.

TextEdit isn't easy to customize, but all the options are there (I think).

That's why I prefer TextEdit to Notepad++. It's a no-frills text editor that does what I need.

But I've never heard of e before... gotta check it out now.

be sure to checkout the screencast
which will show some of the cool features (Multiselection, TextMate Bundles)
when you download the trial: Please let Cygwin install itselfe since half of
the power does come via cygwin.
Be sure to checkout Bundles->Edit Bundles->Manage Bundles too - here you can
download / update the Bundles.

You can even blog via e and xmlrpc via the Blogging-Bundle

Yes, if you'll notice, I started that one.

I was hoping to take this discussion in the other direction. If we're
going to eliminate ID's, we need to provide an alternative to
using/needing them.

I'm not missing IDs on categories or links or tags, but I think it's
seriously missing on the Manage Posts page. For instance, how are you
supposed to use [gallery123] if you don't even know which one is 123 ?
IDs are definitely missing on this page.

-1 to moving away from IDs. It's the only never changing value of a post.

+1 to showing IDs to like "edit_themes" cap users or something. I like
hiding them from people who don't need them, but it's a handy thing to have
access to.

With due respect to the WordPress edit admin, I _love_ blogging  
straight from TextMate.  It's faster than logging in and loading the  
edit page, and once you know the edit commands you fly. :)

I don't liky WYSIWYG and as Stepen is using "real" TextMate he's running
MacOS, which - up to my knowledge - isn't compatible to .net Apps

Anyway: I don't like MS steps into the internet - not with IE and not with
MSDN / Livesearch and not with Frontpage, IIS or whatever.
When they released MS Expression Web they claimed to create standards-based
sites. Some wise guy said: (translated) "if MS's Expression Web really
creates standard complient XHTML 1.0 Websites ... you won't be able to visit
them with IE".

For what it's worth I'll second that

I maintain some Chinese language installations, I can't make heads or 
tails of the Chinese characters :-/
Post IDs are about the only thing allowing me and the authors to 
communicate meaningfully.

Another -1 on moving away from IDs, for the same reason.  ID never  
changes; title and slug can change.

Allow both if you think slugs are easier to work with, but don't  
remove the ability to work with IDs.

I want to update the "Tested up to" value in the readme.txt file in my
plugins hosted on the plugin directory to indicate they're compatible
with 2.5. I won't be making any other changes. Does anyone know if
just this change will trigger a plugin update notification on people's
Plugins screens?

As long as the Version number doesnt change, It should be fine.

While generally advised against, I've made some changes to the readme.txt  
file in the stable tag to reflect changess, and then commited to the same  
tag.
It doesnt trigger an update notice, And the changes will be refelcted in  
the .zip and on the .org page within about an hour.

AFAIK there will only be a update notification when you release a new
version, not when you change parts of your current release (including but
not limited to the readme). I wouldn't change the version number...

As long as you don't change the current version number, a notice will not be
triggered.

Yeah, slugs are already allowed in many, many places ( is_page('about'),
etc.) which is a great thing. However, ID should still be primary. That's
the whole point of the ID after all.

Everyone is correct. I update my trunk readme files all the time to tweak
them, etc. and it won't trigger an update.

But the trunk readme file isn't used for this value as far as I know from
reading the subversion howto the one of the latest stable is used - am I

Hi there,

a while ago I've opened a bug report in trac
(http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5270). I am willing to create a bugfix
as proposed in my (McShelby) comment from 04/12/08 in case it sounds like
a resonable solution to you. What do you think?

Regards
S?ren

Correct, Which is why i update it in the stable tags tag..
whilst its not advised, For cases such as readme.txt changes, it seems ok  
to me to commit the change into the tag.

Private posts should remain private, and they shouldn't be included in
public counts. Adding tags per-user would create too much overhead
with too little benefit for most blogs. If you really need this, you
should look into writing a or finding someone who can write a plugin.

I wasn't aware that the count was meant to be a public count only. This
will render the tagging/categories system useless for all the guys that
are using their blog as a private diary and do not publish often. Very
disappointing.

It may seem incomprehensible and unexpected to the user (at least for me)
that tagging only works for published posts while other functionality
works pretty well with private posts (eg. hiding comments in various
locations for private posts).

Hi!
Thanks Alex for good questions.

>    1. What the UI actually looks like

Main idea of comment client is same idea like mail client where message is
comment. I made main window of application  look like Outlook Express.
Programm has toolbar, folder treeview, comment listview and quickview panel.

>    2. What features the application actually has

Sorry for my english. I tried wrote following:
Comment client is a program to managing comments in the blog. To manage
comments blogger must visit administration panel. Now with Comment client
you have remote access to comments database and dont need to visit blog for
every comment.
Comment client is like to mail client where messages is comments. You can do
usual things such as: read, edit, create, delete, reply, approve or mark as
spam.
Comment client installed as desktop Windows application. Programm Supports
all versions of Windows: from 98 to Vista
inclusive. There are also available portable version of Comment Client:
http://commentclient.com/download/wpcommentclient.zip

 which not a required installation and can be run from usb flash drive.
Intuitive and simply organized moderation comments: just select comments in
the list and click the right mouse button that appears in the context menu
and click: approve, hold, mark as spam, delete, and so on. If mouse stay on
comment in list hint window shows comment content.

Comments editor has options to edit html tags and has editable browser. And
one of the most important feature is spell-checker.

Comment client can manage a several blogs at once. Each account blog
organized as a tree: at the top level is fresh comments (inbox), which has a
subfolders:
 "Outgoing" - a comment that you have written or edited, but have not yet
sent to the blog.
 "Moderate" - get there if their comments mark a pending moderation or at
the time of receipt of new notes, if checked "Sort by folders incoming
comments"
 "Spam" - is the same as "Moderate", well of course it concerns only spam
 "Deleted" - there are placed deleted comments. If you delete the comments
from a folder, "Deleted", they will be placed in the Windows Recycle Bin
 "archive" - a folder where you can move comments from other folders when
they become too many, as well as possible from 'archive' move back to the
Inbox


You can drag and drop comments from one folder to another, or copy through
copying. If you have any ideas on the improvement of comment client, I will
accept them and always will respect.

Link to dowload Windows application:
http://commentclient.com/download/wpcommentclientsetup.exe

Link to download server part which must be uploaded to before using client:
http://commentclient.com/download/xmlrpc-comments.php

Moreother I developed blog client with sinonimiser which will be interesting
to seo webmasters. Link to download (freeware, Windows only):
http://commentclient.com/download/socialblogclientsetup.exe

"whilst its not advised"
yes - but I think if you only want to add some new FAQs or change some other
information in the readme this shouldn't be anything you'd have to bother
your users with to "update" while there is no benefit at all when they do.

Can someone tell me how the stuff with the screenshots (add some to the
pages) works? I have no clue at all... Standard-Readme has an ordered list
and says something I'd understand as putting them into the stable releases
directory - but this would mean that the zip would grow without any benefit
to the user...

+1 for the same reasons (translations etc). I think there are also
ways to show the id that aren't as cumbersome as giving them a whole
table column but make them available for the rare cases when they are
needed.

Of course, for anyone who actually gets lost because they aren't
displayed, remember that they are still in all url's in the admin
sections, so you can just hover your mouse over links or look at the
address bar (on the edit page) to see what the ID of the relevant
object is. Not ideal but workable at least.

Those cases are not particularly rare. Anybody making a website that's
anything more than "My personal blog" will need IDs at some point,
currently.

I'm pretty sure that the screenshots uses the files in trunk, not the
files in the tagged version, despite what the documentation says.

Sorry, I forgot to clarify -- I use trunk for my stable and a folder in
"branches" (if need be) for unstable. This is because WP.org used to serve
tag zip files with the version number on the folder name forcing users to
rename their folders before uploading.

Now that we have is_front_page() in addition to is_home(), I think we 
should have a template file for it. I'm suggesting that we use 
front-page.php falling back on home.php then index.php. I opened a 
ticket (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6801) and attached a patch.

if this was that way it seems to have changed.
Just tried it (cause I would had some problems if this would happen) and had
no probs at all... while the .zip's name contains .ve.rs.io.n

Another anoying thing is: if you create an empty folder the .zip will not
contain it (yes I added and commited the folder) - you will have to throw
some not needed files in...whatever thats good for.

Meh, I didn't even know about this template tag (when was it introduced?)

So, now, we have index, home and front page?
Can anyone give me a few word explanation of how a "front page" and a 
"home page" can differ ? :)

is_home() is where your posts are (usually /index.php, but can be set to a
Page). is_front_page() is /index.php, regardless of what's there.

"When a static page is being used as the front page of your blog, the  
is_home() function returns false. There is no simple function for  
determining "front of site, regardless of blog or page""

which is where is_front_page() comes in, Returning true for ( Current page

This is what got me confused. I don't get the point of having index.php 
and front-page.php...

For the same reason there is a home.php and an index.php. You can see 
the current hierarchy here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy

Most of the sites that I work on use a static page as the front page, 
moving the blog to another page (usually something like CompanyName Blog 
or CompanyName News), so I used the code contained in the is_front_page 
function pretty regularly. Currently the index.php is sort of a 
catch-all for anything that you DON'T have a file for. I personally 
think it should stay that way. I mean, we COULD just get rid of all of 
these pages, and use index.php and a bunch of conditionals (the same 
conditionals that are used not to decide what file to use), but the 
template files are there as a convenience. For me, and probably quite a 
few others that develop business sites (almost exclusively), it would be 
really nice to have.

... I don't quite get it, exactly. If you're using a static page as
the front page, why not simply assign it it's own Page Template?

I mean, I kinda see your point, but the "front" page is basically
either a Static-Page or home.php/index.php if you have posts on it.
Adding another template file doesn't make much sense, because there's
no room for it.

To explain further via the process of breaking it down:
Case 1: Posts on front page.
- Template is home.php fallback to index.php.
Case 2: Static front page.
- Template is custom Page Template fallback to page.php fallback to index.php.

Where, exactly, would you insert a front.php into that in each case?
What would be the purpose of it that could not be achieved otherwise?

I wrote my solution in Perl (except for the WP plugin piece), and it 
tied into my host's firewall system. I implemented timeouts so that IP 
numbers would expire from my block list after a period of inactivity. 
Since the main pieces were stand-alone scripts, I was able to use to 
block email spam hosts, too, by monitoring my sendmail logs.

Hey Roy....


I'm all for adding PostgreSQL compatibility to WP - always have been. But I
think this would fall under the category of doing the right thing for all
the wrong reasons.....

I don't think Sun wants to piss off any of MySQL's current users, and even
if they do, they can't for various legal and financial reasons (GPL - as
much as I have issues with it - guarantees MySQL will be totally free
forever && they'd murder MySQL's success and financial outlook if they tried
anything of the sort via a loophole or something). Unless there is something
I'm missing here?

MQ

there are any issues that will occur with Sun appropriating

putting up a brave front to settle everyone's worries.  Really it was
almost a non-issue. Yeah, sure they talked about it but not in a

I see what you are saying, I was under the impression we shouldn't need 
custom page templates for the basic use cases.  This way, a template 
could include a front page design, without having to tell the user to 
add it as a template if they need.  I've been using a custom page 
template for the front page, I have made one for nearly every WordPress 
site I've ever built, it just seems that since we now have built-in 
functionality to test for the front page, we might as well add it to the 
template loader.  It's one more elseif in a long line of them, and one 
more function.  Not a big deal, there are even hooks that can be used to 
automatically apply the template page if you want.

So, how soon before there's something like OpenMySQL or FreeMySQL 
branch, perhaps run by some *former* MySQL developers?

Counter that five-day-old techspot piece with the one from today:
http://www.techspot.com/news/29811-sun-backing-off-on-plans-for-closed-source-mysql-addons.html

Basically... says they're not sure WHAT will happen with the "add ons".  
But the prior MySQL CEO notes that they already had plans for 
closed-source enterprise level stuff PRIOR to the Sun acquisition.

so please let's not turn this into a bust-on-Sun thing, or a 
now-can-we-drop-mysql thing. ;)

Yeah, I see that, I'm just trying to grasp where you want it fitted
into the hierarchy.

Look at those cases again. Are you thinking of this sort of change?

Case 2: Static front page.
- Template is custom Page Template fallback to front.php fallback to
page.php fallback to index.php.

The reason I ask is that I'm not certain how to handle front.php in
the default case, where the main blog posts are the front page. Would
it only be used for the static front page case?

My viewpoint is that a template name like that should have a well
defined place in a theme, since a theme can include them. So
what/where would it make sense for a theme to include as the front
page?

Good point.  In order to keep backwards compatibility, if the user uses 
posts as the front page, it should really go:
front.php -> home.php -> index.php

If the user uses a static page:
customTemplate -> front.php -> page.php -> index.php

I attached a new diff to the ticket: 
http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6801/6801.002.diff

Would that make more sense?

Yes, some months beforehand they offered a benchmarking addon, which was
proprietary. I am actually supportive of Sun -- don't get me wrong --
but they are likely to close bits of code that compel people to pay up
and justify Sun's investments. But not money is the issue here, but also
readjustment of the stack.

Oh, no. I would never want to drop MySQL. Almost nobody would. However,
I can recall long discussions that took place here a couple of years ago
about facilitating more options (databases). Alex King maybe had a go at
it, but I can't recall for sure. In any event, there is more
justification for this now, especially if MySQL is no longer the
ultimate darling that can never do wrong. I could share here some recent
stories about Sun harming OSS projects.

Both are nonsense.
sorry for this harsh answer, I don't want to offend, but as I understand it,
you don't see the obvious point in this.

you'd need a static_front_page.php and a index_front_page.php since it isn't
the templates choise if the frontpage displays the_loop() or just a page.

Is you use only front_page.php this will result in the theme breaking
whenever someone doesn't agree with the theme authors choise for what the
frontpage has to be used for.

Today you need a if... else... check for checking wether a page is frontpage
or not.
after your change - you'll need it too, but in another file.
That just makes no sense.

Imagine I create a front.php which does displays the loop and is layouted
for that and you try displaying a page in it... no good idea if I offer a
page.php which is layout for exactly this.
If I create a front.php which is made for static pages the_loop wont be used
and therefor it will not work at all if you try using it as index

Just my 2ct.

Sun is unlikely to let this happen. It will be as coy as necessary to
ensure no forking. It also requires a lot of manpower to catch up (think
Linux kernel forking by Oracle). One company that could fork was IBM,
but it has just put its money on postgres.

I suppose I see the point.  While it would be handy in my cases, it 
would be less handy for others.  Ticket closed.

Um, it already exists and is called the community edition.

I also agree the Sun acquisition is a non-issue as far as using MySQL  
for free is concerned and anyone saying different is a "chicken  
little" pundit posting speculation to attract traffic to their blog.

No no, I meant the possibility of a fork that is not associated with Sun 
in any way.

On the other hand, looking at the average speed most ISPs upgrade their 
software, it would be at least couple of years before WordPress is 
affected in any way.

Message-ID: <480E47D1.90902@gmail.com>

Hi,

I know that this is a bit off-topic, but maybe someone around here had 
to do what I need.

TinyMCE that comes with 2.5 uses <p style="text-align: center;"> to 
center stuff in the page. And that's the way it oughts to be.

Problem is my blog is aggregated into a planet that ignores this and 
there, centered text and images goes left.

Does anyone knows of a tiny hack to make the editor align things with <p 
align="center"> ?

I know it's deprecated, but it works both in my blog and in the planet.

Any help would be appreciated.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

Nice :) I'll take a better look at this one

The easiest hack would be to add:

content = content.replace(/<p style="text-align: center;">/g, '<p 
align="center">');

just above "// Pretty it up for the source editor" in wp-admin/js/editor.js.

If you need it to stick after upgrading WordPress, you'll need to make a 
small plugin for TinyMCE to do that when saving.

Even better (IMHO) would be a server-side solution that filters the
output; this way, it will be correct in the database, and you can turn
it off:

<?php
add_filter('the_content', 'classic_align');

function classic_align($content)
{
	return str_replace(
		'<p style="text-align: center;">',
		'<p align="center">',
		$content
	);
}
?>

(Save as plugin or in theme's functions.php. You can also build in a
condition to make it only happen for the aggregator.)

Surely supplementing the inline style with the align attribute would
be preferable to replacing it.

I don't ment to close the ticket - if you want to do it and it might indeed
be handy in many cases this would be best served with two templates
one for static and one for indexed frontpage.

would try a regexp in the filter function - something like:

add_filter('the_content', 'classic_align');

function classic_align($content)
{
$pattern = '~(\<[^>]*style="[^"]*text-align: center[^>]*)~i';
$replace = '\1 align="center"';
return preg_replace($pattern, $replace, $content);
}
?>

written blindly out of my head but should do it anyway.

I think having such a template wouldn't hurt and would actually be helpful.
It means theme authors could create a template for the homepage and the user
wouldn't have to assign their home Page a custom template manually.

Yep it really would be helpful - but only when you make two of them, one for
actual index-front-pages and one for actual static-front-pages.
Combining both in one file would not leed down the right road since the
displayed content is much different... one uses the loop to show more then
one content item and the other one will show only one content item.

So why not checking this and then going to static_front.php and
index_front.php? Would be much better than adding a front.php which would
have to be divided into if(is_page()){ ... } and else {...} I think.

I really didn't want to be offensive,
Aaron, I just do belive there will many templates which feature only
one of both but use front.php for it and where many stuff will go
wrong
whenever you change your frontpage to whatever of both is not supportet -
while having both would provide the right fallbacks for the unsupported way
since noone will create a file he has no content for (or I won't want to use
his theme anyway)

Ok, I re-opened and amended the ticket.  The home.php file is meant to 
be for the front page, if the front page is posts (uses is_home).  Since 
that side of it is already handled, I changed the function to 
get_static_front_page_template and it only uses that if you are on the 
front page AND it's a static page (if is_front_page() is true, and 
is_home() was false).  The order in this case goes:
CustomTemplate -> front-page.php -> page.php -> index.php

I am not affiliated with Sun (or with any of its competitors for that
matter), but Mickos Marten, Simons Phipps and others discuss this at the
moment. It turns out that someone brought this thread this to Simon's
attention (or maybe he got alerted using other means).

I used to know this one:

I actually don't know if it still works, but it's worth a look. :-)

I had my buddies custom ban / blockage script already. It has it's own 
admin interface and all.. bans on three levels of ip ranges, or 
whatever. not a domain name. i had 21,000 some banned ... it slowed my 
site load time a good bit.. I don't need that again though lmao... I 
banned spammers and proxies .. If there was a main central database... 
we could UNLOAD these ips too.. then have the script check it BEFORE 
they'd access it.. that'd be awesome.. I dunno if that's possible tho.. 
If I remember right.. this is the last proxy ip list I've done up..
http://spencerp.net/id/55  this isn't including spammers of course..

Of course with site load time lackage(s)... I deleted the ban script and 
all bans. So, proxies and such are accessible on my site. Which I HATE.. 
but .. I don't like the lack of load times either though.. so I removed 
bans.. This custom ban script isn't free nor will be sold right away. He 
plans to sell it, but not yet. The PHP code is secured and I can't even 
tweak it.. I have to have him tweak it for me ... I had it to where two 
domains / two wp databases were running off the SAME admin/ panel 
bannage sections and database bannages ...

So if I added 20,000 bans on VB.com .. spencerp.net would have same 
coverage as VB.com. OR, individually. But either way, the code was 
secure. I couldn't use the same script on my Xampp localhost... without 
him making a special one for it to run off http://localhost/ for the 
"domain".

I could get his ban script again, since I moved my sites off 
dreamhost.com to his host inlinehosting.com servers... but I still see 
the same crap happening anyway, even though spam dropped incredibly...

Aaron:

Call it front.php, not front-page.php. Too long, and addition of a
dash makes it confusing. All the rest of the page names are simple,
keep it simple too.

I had my buddies custom ban / blockage script already. It has it's own 
admin interface and all.. bans on three levels of ip ranges, or 
whatever. not a domain name. i had 21,000 some banned ... it slowed my 
site load time a good bit.. I don't need that again though lmao... I 
banned spammers and proxies .. If there was a main central database... 
we could UNLOAD these ips too.. then have the script check it BEFORE 
they'd access it.. that'd be awesome.. I dunno if that's possible tho.. 
If I remember right.. this is the last proxy ip list I've done up..
http://spencerp.net/id/55  this isn't including spammers of course..

That could be fixed, here was my thought: front.php is a pretty standard 
name, and a lot of themes may have this already, and it may not be for 
this specific use case.  I used the hyphen because the category pages 
are hyphenated (category-6.php).

Having some people weigh in on the ticket itelf would probably be nice.

"...I shudder to think of the number of times the Coding Horror

the naive -- no, that's too tame -- brainlessly stupid dynamic
rendering approach WordPress uses."

I wish he'd quit beating around the bush and say what he really thinks.

I'm not sure I specifically see the point in this, but if the theme 
developer wanted to, couldn't they just add the necessary code to the top:
/*
Template Name: Static Front Page
*/

On the other hand a longer file name has no practical downside, and
"front-page.php" makes it clear what the file actually is.  Even if there's
been a historical "shorter = better" tendency, it'd be nice to move away
from that.

I wouldn't call it front.php because front-page.php has "page" in its name
which - sortof - clarifies it is for *page* and not for *index* (while
home.php _is_ confusing - but unfortunatly can not be changed into
front-index.php for compatibility reasons...)

You probably don't need to be getting up there into the 20,000 range.  
In my experience, bad IPs move around a lot. For scripts  
like .htakismet or reducer, this means you don't need to keep bad IPs  
blocked forever - a month might be fine. If it turns out the IP is  
still spamming a month later, it'll get re-added. I'd suggest that  
the .htakismet blocklist be a rolling system that keeps no more than,  
say, 500 rules, rolling the old ones off the bottom (or top).

In the case of reducer, which feeds the firewall rather  
than .htaccess, this happens automatically if your firewall (like  
mine) is configured to keep a rolling (rather than permanent) list of  
bad IPs.

But what he said above is less-damaging than the truth. 

What he says: The problem is in the approach WP uses.
The truth: The problem is in the IMPLEMENTATION of the approach that WP
uses.

So perhaps some things are best left unsaid :)

 Not particularly.

 Try benchmarking a typical MediaWiki installation against a typical
WordPress. Both will do gruesome things to the server in question.

> So perhaps some things are best left unsaid :)

 What should be said is: So go and put a decent caching strategy in
front of your dynamic content!

His main concern seems to be that the page is fully regenerated and
lots of database calls are done every time the page is hit. Which is a
perfectly valid one, but somebody should really point him at the
object caching system in 2.5:

http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/wordpress-25-and-the-object-cache/

Basically, his concerns are valid, but he doesn't get that WordPress
is a base system with addons (in the form of plugins) for specific
cases.

Hey, he's Microsoft-centric. This makes him prone to thinking that
software packages should be complete and cover all possible cases in
that package. This is the same sort of thinking that gets you
Microsoft Office.

The Linux-centric crowd tends to go for the smaller packages that do a
single thing well and then plugging them together for your final
solution approach.

Which is going to be a part of any decent scaling strategy for any

Not to mention that PHP on Windows is slower than PHP on Linux, and  
PHP CGI is slower than mod_php, in my experience.

Eric, thank you for pointing that out, as it's just what I was thinking.

I've never run PHP on Windows, but I've been stuck with PHP as a CGI  
rather than module and discovered performance is perhaps 10X slower.

Just for the record, he's running it on Windows as *Fast*CGI, which is only
negligibly slower than mod_php on Windows and not /that/ much worse than
mod_php on Linux (it's what I'm using).

That requires the user assigning the custom Page template to the Page that
is being used for the front of the site.

Yes, totally possible, but this new template would just make it easier for
theme developers to make more customized themes.

Hello,

Jeff's obviously a WP fan and not dumb, and John created Markdown and is
also not dumb.

The whole "bash influentials and dismiss their comments" is the FOSS clich?,
but that's boring.

What if the WP community were to listen and respond to a WP weakness by
announcing that it would add a proven, well-respected solution to future
releases?  What if it acted fast and announced that next week?

If it takes a year to make WP-as-shipped run as efficiently as it can run
with a plug-in, this might as well *be* an MS project.

* Even Matt said in 2005, "I've linked it before, and it?s worth doing
again: WP Cache makes WordPress perform as well as a completely static-file
site, able to handle hundreds of requests per second without breaking a
sweat."

Yes, fine, but what if the WP community argued about it for a while
and then decided that he was full of crap instead? Just because he's
influential doesn't make him correct.

However, as has already been stated, this sort of thing is a Google
Summer of Code project that was already in the works. It's even said
in the comments on Jeff's own page.

Just thought I'd mention that one of my WordPress-powered sites was on the
front page of Autoblog.com AND Jalopnik.com today and my server didn't even
notice (no load spikes except for bandwidth). True, I do have WP-Super-Cache
installed, but this is hardly the ideal solution for most blogs due to the
lack of dynamic content (I had to code up some AJAX and other JS to keep the
dynamic header + dynamic countdown). The site also doesn't allow comments or
have any polls or anything, so it can get away with static caches. I don't
run any caching for example on my personal blog for example though.

All in all, I think it comes down to a fundamental difference in how things
should be done. Do you want to spend half an hour to make a new post or do
you want it instant? For like 95% of blogs out there, 100% dynamic with no
caching is just fine.

For those that suffer from slow load times, they are either running
WordPress on a poor server (Windows, unoptimized, underpowered, or whatever)
or they should enable the object cache (which helps quite a bit, especially
if you cache to like X-Cache) or go hardcore with full static.

However, don't get me wrong, I am looking forward to that Google SOC project
getting completed. Assuming it doesn't suffer from the problems of the first
object cache, it will be a welcomed addition for those medium sized sites
running on cheap hosts. Less load is can never be a bad thing.

I wonder.

Jeff has a point, but it is a matter of convenience verses speed. I'll 
rather have convenience where the speed difference is negligible. I'm 
not convinced that Matt Mullenweg is a genius or someone I should bow 
down to and worship, like say Peter Westwood or Rasmus Lerdorf. Now 
those are people I can build a shrine to.

Ah, coding horrors. I can tell you of some coding horrors. None of them 
have to do with WordPress, I can tell you that. Well, I could relate 
past WTFs and coding horrors I've seen while working with WordPress and 
trying to patch the core to fix bugs. I'm not going to, because 
complaining doesn't create solutions and when you have solutions there 
isn't a need to complain.

Also, they have more to do with speculation and my personal opinion, so 
hopefully and I seriously mean that, I'm wrong. If I was to state 
anything, it will probably be suggestions on how to not repeat the 
coding horrors. All of my coding horrors with WordPress have nothing to 
do with performance, but I like how the guy says that the community is 
great, but fails to mention that core team is great too (there might be 
a hidden message there? Maybe, but probably not). I think the community 
is great too and Peter and Ryan.

Jacob Santos is a genius.

Also, one thing I've done and felt worked well was just caching
arrays/objects in the options table using custom keys in my private
plugins, like if I had a long slow query of "get all users, make sure
they have posted recently, check if they have an avatar uploaded,
organize them into random sets of 5" I would then just save the
resulting array into a wp option and create another option that has a
unixtime expiry date after which the first option will be refreshed.
Replaces heavy strain on the db with extremely light strain and
doesn't have any filesystem overhead. It's how WP already works for
storing feeds fetched through magpie.

Are there problems with this system? Other than the obvious semantic
issue (they're not 'options'), is there a performance problem I'm not
picking up on? Why not just create a 'caches' table that mimicks the
options table and give everything a key, value and expiry? Obviously
you'd still want to use supercache for sites that are getting tons of
hits, but this system would work really well for everyone right out of
the box, without fiddling with folder permissions etc.

Sarcasm? I'm not actually, which is to say that there are far better 
developers than myself and quite a few of them are on this mailing list. 
Quite a humbling experience thinking you're awesome to finding people

On NFS systems where the file system is separated from the web server, 
it might be quicker. However you wouldn't get the performance, like if 
you had a memory cache, APC, XCache, memcache, which will store 
variables in memory where it can be accessed far quicker than that in a 
database.

Likewise, having serialized data in a database row prevents accurate 
searching of contents. However, it probably doesn't violate it since 
what you are interested is not what is in the data, but the index to get 
the data.

There is overhead from the amount of transfer between the database and 
PHP. The smaller the amount of data, the quicker it can reach PHP. 
Likewise, it would increase the complaints about the amount of queries 
being made.

theme developer.

This is *in addition* to the functionality already discussed.

What is the typical turn-around time when registering a plugin on
wp-plugins.org?  I submitted a request yesterday morning but haven't heard
anything but couldn't find any mention of an expected turn-around either.  I
have a WP 2.5 Admin Theme I have been working on which may be of interest to
others so I thought I would make it accessible.  The Admin Theme changes the

releases.

I don't know what the typical time is, but for me it's taken between a
month and six weeks several times.

I am looking at wp_mail() and I am wondering about the optional header
argument.  If I construct a header which has "Cc:" and "Bcc:" fields in it,
should the Cc and Bcc recipients receive the mail  simply because they
appear in the header or do I explicitly need to send to them too as part of
the "To" argument?

 

Thanks,

Following the example of the Default theme, my custom theme uses

Execution time reported by timer_stop has stayed about the same, but
that's not a terribly consistent metric anyway. I'm on a shared
server, so I expect to see a lot of fluctuation in there.

Has 2.5.1 really caused such a dramatic increase in queries, or has
something changed about the way get_num_queries reports?

There has been no change in counting of SQL queries AFAIK, they're still  
all counted.

What has changed however, Is that the Disk-based Object cache was removed  
 from 2.5, So if you had it enabled previously, That would've cut down on  
the number of queries made significantly.

How many queries before/after are we talking about here? (And i assume it  
was 2.3.x you were using previously?)

Yes, passing a Cc: or Bcc: header should work. Take a look at how the  
Subscribe2 plugin works:

With 2.5, loading my front page would generate 41 queries. With 2.5.1,
the very same page generates 74 queries.

What are the queries?  2.5.1 eliminates a lot of queries in the admin.
 Nothing was done with front end queries, at least on purpose.

You can try a plugin like Dump Queries to see what queries are being made.

I'm getting a 404 error on the download links (I'm guessing because
there is no readme.txt file), but you can get it straight from svn.

Then you're looking in the wrong place, which you would know if you  
read those pages I sent you.

This is a mailing list for WordPress developers, not malicious  
malcontents who enjoy wreaking havoc. Hacker doesn't mean what you  
think it means.

I will tell you something:

A hacker is someone who does great, crazy or unexpected stuff with a
computer (hacking on the keyboard). Most of them are working as
developers, security experts or stuff like that - many are coding open
source stuff in theire free time.
What you're searching is a cracker.
Nobody on this list will guide you there - we all want our pages to stay
secure ;-)

...and yet he somehow followed the links from the mailing list to my blog, where he spammed requesting assistance so he could hack into a site while reassuring that he "wouldn't do anything illegal" with the knowledge:

hacker is after (if you don't get it: It is knowledge and the power to
create things, nothing else, especially not destroying things) - and then
decide if you want to become one.

Now I think we should move this topic to /dev/null since it will not lead to
any end.

Thanks for the pointer to subscribe2.  I took a look at the code and the
header I am seeing looks identical to the header used in the subscribe2
plugin.  I am wondering if the header not being processed is a platform
issue.  My server is running under IIS.  Any known issues with header
processing on a Windows box?

Thanks,

Mike

Yes, passing a Cc: or Bcc: header should work. Take a look at how the  
Subscribe2 plugin works:

http://docs.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php

===
Note: The Windows implementation of mail() differs in many ways from the  
Unix implementation. First, it doesn't use a local binary for composing  
messages but only operates on direct sockets which means a MTA is needed  
listening on a network socket (which can either on the localhost or a  
remote machine).
Second, the custom headers like From:, Cc:, Bcc: and Date: are not  
interpreted by the MTA in the first place, but are parsed by PHP.
As such, the to parameter should not be an address in the form of  
"Something <someone@example.com>". The mail command may not parse this  
properly while talking with the MTA.
===

So if you're using "Something <someone@example.com>" you may want to try  
just someone@example.com & see if that works (I know it specifically says  
the To statement there, but its worth a shot)

Unless it would work on java, I'd be glad to test and find bugs

tools someday:
What is wrong with java - why would this keep you from using/testing it?
Others may have the same issues with java and when working on such projects
I would want the widest possible audience of course and not to break away a
group because of some java issues.

Nothing is wrong with Java, just personal taste.

I'm a Windows desktop user, and I can't stand how tediously and slowly 
java stuffs generally work on windows, not to mention the often awkward 
installation. I also find java apps poorly integrated with windows most of 
the time. I'd use a comment manager if it's faster and easier to use than 
a "Manage Comments" page in firefox as it is in WP now.

Again, just personal taste, that one might even easily prove wrong with 
this or that particular application. That's just the impression java left 
on me over the last 10 years. Please don't start a "man, java rocks" flame 
thread :) (but feel free to point me off list to any particularly neat 
java stuff you'd know)

The change is assuming that WordPress has been checked out into a
subdirectory "2.5," but the line showing the Subversion check-out
shows that it is not checked out into a sub-directory.  So I would say
that the change is invalid.

Gotta agree with that one, and I say that as somebody who does lots
and lots of java code.

It's just way too easy to write a crappy Java desktop application.
Writing one that doesn't suck is quite difficult. But when you write a
sucky one, you can rest assured in the knowledge that it will suck
equally on all platforms, without favor. ;-)

However, Java on the server side rocks, once you grasp the
fundamentals and get over all the CGI background type of thinking.

xulrunner might be a good option too.  There are some cool cross-platform
programs other than Firefox that are built on that, like Flickr's new

Message-ID: <20d17d690804291010j58947129pb92c45319902f917@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a few pickles with client installations that I would like to resolve
using SQL functions. I come from a MSSQL and programming background but my
work now is more geared towards coaching and supporting bloggers who are not
technologically inclined and personalizing WordPress so they think it is
pretty.

They can come up with the most novel ways of breaking their WordPress with
dubious plugins or themes and I do my best to fix it.

I would like to build a mentoring relationship with someone who is all about
the mechanics of WordPress. I really wish to connect with a WP-Hacker and
this is why I am not posting this in the WP-pro list. I don't really have
anything to offer in return but I am keen anough to figure out how I can
contribute to you work in the long run.

I understand what makes the car work but I don't wish to reverse engineer
every car that comes in the shop.

Please reply to me privately.

Sincerely,

Marie-Lynn

   - I am using:
	comments_template('comments_facebook.php');

And putting a customized comments_facebook.php file inside the theme  
directory.

What I'd prefer to do is keep the comments_facebook.php in the plugin  
directory, and point to it via the comments_template(); call,
or,
just include comment-template.php (and all the functions it defines)  
in my plugin - but I don't think I can include outside the template  
directory.

I could just copy all those functions inside the plugin folder and  
include from there, but that seems a nasty hack.

Any recommendations?

The 0.6 version of the plugin which I am current using at http://apps.facebook.com/openparenthesis/ 
  should be posted to the plugin directory shortly, or you can grab it  
from here:

There's no reason you can't include a file in your plugin's
sub-directory for the comments template.  Just filter
'comments_template' and pass to it the absolute path to your included
file.

Definitely Inline Hosting's problem.

If you're game, you could try compiling SVN yourself.

I know these instructions are for DreamHost, but they should be exactly
the same for Inline Hosting:

http://wiki.dreamhost.com/SVN#Upgrading_to_Newest_Subversion

BTW, why do you use "plink" to connect? It's probably better to use
putty -- you get a better UI, although I guess it's a matter of personal
preference.

Nah, it was on my end. When my buddy and his host tech support guy, did 
a FULL back up / move of my files and databases and such.. it included 
the .svn folders/ files and everything from main root/ as well as the 
blogs which came from Dreamhost.com originally of course..

I went into Cpanel, used File Manager and removed everything but 
wp-content/   wp-config.php, .htaccess and whatever other important 
NON-wp files... then went into wp-content/ and removed those .svn 
folders that were in there individually and used Putty to connect to 
domain(s) and did a NEW svn co of trunk... it was all good.

Thanks for this Jeremy. But I don't need that anymore, however will 
bookmark it for later if needed. ;) About all my domain registrations 
are moved from Dreamhost.com to Namecheap.com now.. and about all of 
them are pointing to his host now. Once VB.COM passes that 60 day (new 
domain registration rule) on the 18th next month, that's being moved to 
Namecheap as well. And its bye bye Dreamhost.com for good! Whoo Hoo! 
Dreamhost.com should change their name to NightmareHost.com.. because 
that's what it was.. nothing but a nightmare being on their crappy 
servers and such.. wheee

I forget where I got the "plink" thing from.. I think I followed an 
older guide before, about how to setup SSH or whatever on Windows...
http://www.phileplanet.com/archives/2006/08/how-to-setup-ssh-on-windows-xp/

There might have been another one too, but I can't find link for it... 
I'm currently only using PUTTY now.. so I'm good to go!! =D

Subject: [wp-hackers] Please stop saying WordPress is Unit Tested
Message-ID: <4817E2E6.7070709@santosj.name>

There have been and are several references to the Automattic WordPress 
Tests to being Unit Tests and tests in the Automattic WordPress Tests 
test suite to being unit tests. "Unit test" refers to the way it is run 
and not to the actual test. The create name for the tests, when 
referring to the tests in the test suite is, 'test case'. The the entire 
test cases grouped as a whole is called a test suite.

Currently, the way the Automattic WordPress Tests is run is not done in 
the fashion of "Units." There are some mocks, but that does not 
immediately make the test case an unit test. The Unit Test term refers 
to separation of the run time or the test suite from every other test 
suite and also from execution. What this means is that the unit test 
pulls in just the functions it needs to run (while mocking dependencies) 
and running the execution independent of WordPress execution.

The Automattic WordPress Tests are not executed as units and are instead 
run aside and dependent on the WordPress execution. Meaning if I called 
a function in one test suite, it could affect the results in another 
test suite or that I will have to clear out any possible interruptions 
to functions I'm going to call in order to provide consistent and 
accurate results.

I edited the codex page on the Automattic WordPress Tests to remove the 
reference to unit tests and instead describe the way the Automattic 
WordPress Tests, by default it runs.

Thank you.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Lost categories upgrading to 2.5.1
Message-ID: <4817EDFE.4000204@metalab.unc.edu>

I decided to upgrade my blog to 2.5.1 tonight from back in the 2.2 
region, and promptly lost all my categories.

This also broke my permalinks. However the categories still seem to be 
there if I know the old names for them.

This is the first time a WordPress upgrade has gone so badly for me.

The upgrade produced lots of error messages like this:

WordPress database error: [Table 'elharo_wordpress.wp_terms' doesn't exist]
SELECT term_id, term_group FROM wp_terms WHERE slug = ?uncategorized?

WordPress database error: [Table 'elharo_wordpress.wp_terms' doesn't exist]
INSERT INTO wp_terms (term_id, name, slug, term_group) VALUES (?1?, 
?Uncategorized?, ?uncategorized?, ?0?)

WordPress database error: [Table 'elharo_wordpress.wp_term_taxonomy' 
doesn't exist]
INSERT INTO wp_term_taxonomy (term_id, taxonomy, description, parent, 
count) VALUES (?1?, ?category?, ?, ?0?, ?2?)

However it did eventually claim

     WordPress database error: [DROP command denied to user 
'elharo_2_w'@'209.68.1.245' for table 'wp_categories']
     DROP TABLE IF EXISTS wp_categories

     WordPress database error: [DROP command denied to user 
'elharo_2_w'@'209.68.1.245' for table 'wp_link2cat']
     DROP TABLE IF EXISTS wp_link2cat

     WordPress database error: [DROP command denied to user 
'elharo_2_w'@'209.68.1.245' for table 'wp_post2cat']
     DROP TABLE IF EXISTS wp_post2cat
     Upgrade Complete

     Your WordPress database has been successfully upgraded!
     Continue


Any suggestions/ideas?

Just wondering, is this editor button already in core, and I'm just

the editor.. Instead of having to remember HOW it's done all the time.. 
or, having it copied/pasted from a text file .. for each time you want 
to use it.. Yeah, I guess it's easy to remember HOW TO do it, once 
you've done it often... just saying though, it would be more convenient 
if it was in button pane already. :P

Well, actually.. if ya wanna get technical about it.. I renamed the 
plugins/ and themes/ folders to something else, bumped them up to blog 
root/ (after having deleted the other stuff) using the FTP client. Then 
deleted the original wp-content/ folder (which contained the .svn 
folders from Dreamhost) .. because SVN Checking out fails for 
wp-content/ because if it already exists, the folder won't be able to be 
added so it won't work.
But after the NEW SVN CO was done.. I manually moved the "renamed" 
plugins/ themes/ folders into the new wp-content/ folder.. into their 
respected original homes.. then bumped up ONLY the custom plugins or 
themes I was using.. then life was peachy.. =D

Looking in the forums it seems that this has happened to others, and 
there's been some trouble tracking the cause down.

At this point I strongly suspect that some necessary tables were not 
created, and consequently a lot of commands failed. I'm going to see if 
I can fix this manually before In attempt to restore form the backup and 
reupgrade or revert.

OK. This is interesting when I try to create the tales manually in MySQL 
I get:

ERROR 1142 (42000): CREATE command denied to user 
'elharo_2_w'@'209.68.1.245' for table 'wp_term_taxonomy'

Maybe this is why it failed in the first place.

It looks like certain tables havnt been created.

Heres what i'd personally do:
Check the permissions for the user that WordPress uses to connect to the  
database and grant it Drop and Create Privledges (at least temporarily),  
Set the db_version option in the database back to the 2.2.x value, and  
then force another upgrade to take place.

For the db_version:  
http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Installation#How_do_you_force_a_database_upgrade.3F

If you dont want to give WP the ability to create/drop tables, You could  
manually create the wp_terms, wp_term_taxonomy, and wp_term_relationships  
tables from the SQL Schema in /wp-admin/includes/schema.php, but thats  
potentially difficult if you dont set the correct names/charsets

I'm continuing to dig in. At the moment it seems I do not have CREATE 
table privileges in the database. I'm not sure why. I've filed a ticket 
with my ISP.

On the WordPress side, I suspect WordPress should check if has that and 
any other necessary privileges *before* attempting the upgrade, Normal 
WordPress usage does not need to create or DROP tables, but some 
upgrades do. WordPress should not assume it is running with sufficient 
privileges to do this. :-(

Previous upgrades were all done on my own system where I had full 
access. I didn't hit this before because I always had all privileges.

It's possible this is why some people have problems with the upgrade 
when most don't.

On the other hand, if WordPress was able to complete its installation,
it must have had the CREATE capability.  Why should it then prepare for
the case that somebody has taken capabilities away...  It is just extra
bloat in the code.

It won't be feasible to check for every possible misconfiguration out
there.  I think it is more feasible to accept that misconfiguration will
result in unwanted behaviour.

Best regards,

Agree - everyone is asked to backup before upgrading, so nothing can be lost
in this process.
If you reconfigure your server to no longer parse php files you wouldn't
expect wordpress to take care for this too, while it would happily spit out
you mysql user/pass whenever someone navigates to wp-config.php.

I think the lost which can arise with that is much grater than having to
backup your data (which indeed may need some priviliges).

The thing is: Normally you have the privileges to do whatever your like at
your database and the ones who changed this (maybe for security reasons)
should know and be easily able reedit privileges whenever upgrading. Why
your host does such nasty stuff like taking away create privileges in
between isn't something to bother wordpress but would be somthing to change
hosts (in my opinion) if there is no really good reson for it.

the button is there AFAIK, but it's on some sort of a hidden/"advanced" 
toolbar, which I can't remember how to turn on right now (/me writes

In fact, I'm a counterexample that the CREATE privilege was necessary to 
complete installation. In my case, it wasn't, probably because I 
transferred from a different system.

I deny that this is a misconfiguration. Running with minimum privileges 
is a sensible security measure.

Regardless, there is no excuse for failing to check an error condition 
and notice that a command has failed. That is simply poor programming.

We perform backups because code and hardware is broken. Backups are a 
countermeasure against badly written software. That doesn't meant the 
software is not at fault for losing data.

False. Normally you don't. Most DBs strictly limit the privileges 
available to users for security reasons.

They never took them away. In fact, WordPress never had these privileges 
in the first place. Like Wordpress itself, you're assuming things about 
my installation that simply aren't true and have never been true. It is 
precisely the unpredictability of configuration in the real world that 
requires extensive error checking for reliable code. Given Wordpress's 
many users, there is simply no way to predict everyone's configuration. 
Anything Wordpress depends on, it needs to check for, not simply assume.

I would just like to point out that many plugins also create tables at 
installation time. So anyone who shuts off their DB permission to 
create tables will likely have trouble installing plugins, as well as 
upgrading. Perhaps this should be added to the Upgrade instructions in 
the Codex?

Shouldn't be hard to type it in the HTML editor, also Alt+Shift+P will 
insert it in the Visual editor.

If you do not have, and have never had, create privileges, how did you  
ever install WordPress in the first place?

Because it was created by another MySQL User who had permissions of course -
because it was imported with another user.

Yes this may create trouble - but as to the fact that UPGRADE and INSTALL
mean you change something at the system this *screams* for having the needed
privileges - and INSTALLING a plugin (which might need tables) or UPGRADING
the software (which might need this too obviously) means you will have
permission to do so - any lack of permission means it will fail!

Try installing some complex software (on linux since windows is something
totally different) which needs specific stuff at installation time which is
not available if you aren't logged in as root, will result in the same
failure if you do not have root permissions.

The thing is: Normally you have the privileges to do whatever your like at

I didn't speak about *good* configuration style but about the *normal*
conditions most hosters run the databases on. And you can not tell me most
hosters give you a database and more than one user while most users do not
have CREATE privilege. I am running websites at 6 different hosts and none
of them offers this for shared hosting by default. I asked a friend of mine
who has 70 different hosters in a hand full of different countries, with
many different shared hostings. His shared hostings never have more than one
user per database (if he doesn't explicitly ask for that) and this one has
all privileges on this DB. This are the normal conditions.

If you are not able to give WP the needed privileges at the time of upgrade
or install you simply can not upgrade and not install. Thats it and that is
why it is misconfiguration. It isn't when you are doing normal things like
blogging, commenting and stuff, but with every upgrade or install it is
misconfiguration if you lack the rights to change your DB structure since
WordPress havily depends on this DB and therefor will eventually have to
change it. This is exactly why you go to the upgrade page - to rearage the
DB - and of course one will need the rights to do it.

Just because something may or may not have been true once (I could
just have easily imported the DB with another account while the WP
account had less privileges - by mistake or intentionally) doesn't
mean it will remain true forever.

I certainly don't expect any software to check for every potential
problem, that'd be ridiculous - the possibilities are endless, but it
should have the ability to say "hey, something just screwed up here so
I better stop what I'm doing" instead of happily chugging along with
undefined results and little to indicate a problem.

In this case, it may not be reasonable for the WP upgrade process to
check every single possible detail before performing an upgrade, but
checking to see whether or not its queries have executed successfully
and acting accordingly doesn't seem out of the question.

Wordpress was originally installed on a different system where it had 
CREATE TABLE privileges. Later the MySQL database was dumped and 
reloaded on a new host by a db admin who did have create table 
privileges. However, the WordPress user on that system never had create 
table privileges, and until now never needed them.

Yes, it's not the normal way this is done; but it's a completely 
reasonable thing to do; and I suspect I'm not the only one who's gone 
that route; and certainly not the only person who will ever do that.

Doubtless there are other unusual combinations of activity that have not 
yet been noticed or predicted. This is why error checking is so 
critical. Software should not assume it knows what the environment is 
without verifying it. Software should recognize and respond to all error 
conditions at runtime; and user should perform backups in case the 
software gets this wrong. No one of these steps is sufficient in itself.

I know... well this mean that system was intended to be used by users
but managed for sysadmin by another user with right priveleges. Then
try tu upgrading WP by a normal user is against how that system was
intended to be used.

Tne it's a no problem again not a WP bug, even id adding a check and a
warning would be nice, but not a bug if not present.

Not all failures are equal. It doesn't bother me that the upgrade 
failed. That's reasonable under these conditions. That WordPress did not 
detect the failure, and proceeded blindly; and in fact reported a 
successful upgrade, bothers me.

Linux installs are hardly a model of good design, but usually they at 
least notice the problem and tell you the install failed, not that it 
succeeded. At least some of the time, the install does nothing without 
the correct privileges. (And at least some of the time, it gets half way 
through and leaves you with a semi-borked system, much like WordPress did.)

As with doctors, the first principle should be, "Do no harm." If you're 
halfway through a nose job and the patient goes into cardiac arrest, 
don't keep going with the operation as if nothing unexpected had happened.

These may be the normal conditions for Wordpress. I don't dispute that 
(though I do know of at least one major shared host that creates 
multiple users per database by default). But any software product that 
has as many different users as Wordpress does is going to find itself 
running in conditions it doesn't expect that it can't consider normal. 
If the conditions are critical to its successful operation, then it is 
OK for Wordpress to report the problem and fail as gracefully as it can 
without losing data. It is not OK for it to proceed as if the problem 
did not exist.

As i said.. then the upgrade should be made by sysadmin with right
privileges, but sound a stupid idea let you be a WP admin let you have
FTP access allow you to upload plugins (that maybe need to create
table) and not give you the necessary privileges.

Sound a poor managed system, or upgrade, adds etc are done by a sys
admin and users doan't have to touche anything and dont' have to have
admin privileges to WP or if they have the NEED some privileges.

A simple test and warning from WP should be nice, but if you can admin
this cann't be called a bug.

Wordpress said the upgrade succeeded when in fact the upgrade had 
failed. That's a bug, regardless of why the upgrade failed.

Actually in my 2.5.1 local test  site at every Alt+Shift+P i saw the
next page dision blink and get a new blank edit page.

Results i got 2 articles or 2 Pages totally empty. That's sound like a
bug.

I agree that the failure to upgrade is not a Wordpress bug. Once I 
understood and verified the root cause of the lost categories problem, 
this became apparent.

However, that the upgrader borks the system when not given sufficient 
privileges is a very serious bug. That the upgrader reports success when 
the upgrade has failed is also a bug.

you're right that it should have reported the failure. Maybe one should add
"If you do not see any error messages above everything is fine now. If you
see any errors something is broken now - you should import your backup or
let your sysadmin do this for you if you lack paermissions.".
Would that satisfy you?

Yes it may be nice to have cancelled the upgrade in this specific case. In
other cases it might be even better to proceed... anyway: It dosn't matter
if your database is messed up a litte or much - you'd have to import the
backup anyway.

However, that the upgrader borks the system when not given sufficient
> privileges is a very serious bug.

You know - most bugs reside behind a keybord, more systems have been crashed
by admins then any hacker could do in a livetime. It is a bug to try
upgrading your database if you lack permissions to do this.

And then there will come some more people and complain about WordPress being
slow.

Yes upgrade may be a critical point. But it isn't only the softwares who
should know upgrading is critial - it should be every one who UPGRADES. If
your system is configured for you to do nothing and not to be able to do
admin things you should simply keep your fingers away from it - and maybe
your damn cool sysadmin should have informed you about that.

damn deleted some stuff before that line which I didn't intend to delete...
You could of course start to try detecting any failure condition before
doing anything else - this can be done with upgrade as well as with the
frontend (you wouldn't want any error messages to be shown - would you?)
But then there will come some more people and complain about WordPress being
slow (becuase of that checks).

What OS/browser are you using? Some browsers especially with customized 
settings wouldn't honor the "stop event propagation" and "cancel default 
action" passed in js.

What might be cool: Move more and nextpage to a TinyMCE dropdown for  
posts, and then remove more from the dropdown when editing pages.

Andrew knows this pretty well, and the nextpage and more could use  
some polish. It can also be an editor state issue since these buttons  
function differently for posts and pages. Like 'more' doesn't do  
anything for pages, but nextpage AND more both work for posts.

To make a better user experience you might have to change TinyMCE  
behavior for posts and pages and that might be tricky.

One thing to note though... nextpage could use a slightly different  
TinyMCE button. The buttons are a tad too similar. So even if you show  
the nextpage button, users will probably happily click away and make  
more tags if both buttons are visible. BUT if you make one button and  
set those options as dropdown listed text the functionality might be  
clearer.

Thanks. Once I set up the tables manually, that did seem to complete the 
upgrade.

I'm still having possible related problems involving comments as shown 
in this image:

http://www.elharo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/managecomments.png

There seem to be comments awaiting moderation, but I can't see them. In 
fact, I can't see any comments in the wp-admin panel at all except for 
what Akismet has caught. That is

http://www.elharo.com/blog/wp-admin/edit-comments.php

always shows "No results found". I can see comments on individual post 
pages though. I have to do some more digging on that problem.

A worse problem would have been having DROP permission but not  
CREATE. If that were the case (unlikely), there would certainly have  
been data loss.

The section of the upgrade script that creates / populates wp_terms,  
and the part that drops the old tables, should be an atomic  
operation. If the data can't be imported into wp_terms, for whatever  
reason (server mis-configuration, etc), full stop, don't blindly  
attempt to drop the source tables.

Is there a trac ticket yet?

I'll go further and say that the entire upgrade should be atomic. If
any part of the upgrade fails, no changes should take place at all.

The very first thing the upgrade should do is to start a transaction.
If there's a failure at any point, a rollback should be issued. If it
gets to the end, a commit can be done.

That is does not do this already makes little sense to me, as it's
easy enough to do.

Guys,

with 2.5.1, tag feeds seem to be broken ?
<http://planetozh.com/blog/wp-feed.php?tag=wordpress> returns an empty
page, while my latest entry is tagged "WordPress"

Am I missing something intentional that got in 2.5.1 ?

Ozh

You're right... The "Publish" button uses the same shortcut and both FF 
2.x and 3.x don't "stop propagation" for some reason. Will have to 
change either the <!--nextpage--> shortcut key or the "Publish" one.
