Subject: [wp-hackers] Children template?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikKd-A-8K_FcfK2465aFwfz3No-um+EC0ZjsymB@mail.gmail.com>

Looking for a way to auto-apply a template to all of a page's
children.  Basically I don't want to go in and assign a custom
template for all the children pages.

Currently... we can create "page-slug.php" or "page-id.php" to apply a
template to a page automatically.   How can I do...
"page-slug-children.php"  or "page-id-children.php" to auto-apply the
template to all children?

Any ideas?

I had a similar situation to you, I needed to initially apply a template to
all existing child pages, then I also wanted to override the template chosen
on the page edit screen to ensure the correct one is always applied.

To apply a template to all children of a particular page, run the following
code just once then remove it:


$pages = get_posts( array(
                        'post_type'   => 'page',
                        'post_parent' => 49
                        ));

if ( $pages ) {
    foreach ( $pages as $page ) {
        update_post_meta( $page->ID, '_wp_page_template',
'page-my-template.php' );
    }
}


And to auto-apply a particular template to certain child pages:


add_action( 'save_post', 'apply_my_template', 10, 2 );

function apply_my_template( $postID, $post ) {

    if (
        !current_user_can( 'edit_post', $postID )
        || 'page' != $post->post_type
        || wp_is_post_revision( $postID )
        || wp_is_post_autosave( $postID )
        || 'auto-draft' == $post->post_status
        || 'trash' == $post->post_status
        )
        return $postID;

    if ( 49 == $post->post_parent )
        update_post_meta( $postID, '_wp_page_template',
'page-my-template.php' );

}

Subject: [wp-hackers] plugin for unit testing
Message-ID: <AANLkTin9GT7zry9kVaTzhkezB_DWXzp+VCfTdgOrAvou@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I recently released a plugin that bundles phpunit and allows one to
write and run unit tests with WordPress plugins, themes, core,
whatever.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-unit/

Have a look and let me know what you think.

Thanks,

It seems that you could put the following code inside the shortcode
function:

global $post;
$url = get_permalink($post->ID);

$url will equal the permalink of the post that is parsing the shortcode.

Thanks,

That would just link me to the current page, I need to get the link to the
page with a specific shortcode.  I was just wondering if there is a more
correct method than using wpdb to query for the id where content =
myshortcode.

You could hook 'save_post' to write a value to a custom field, but I'm sure you were looking for more than that, right?

Message-ID: <1BA9ACD0-40EB-4991-A568-420BF77A5FB7@birdhouse.org>

I'm trying to figure out why my new plugin is showing a screwy version # :
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/solomail/

The current version is 1.3, not 1.2. 
It has an svn tag for 1.3. 
The readme.txt in both trunk and tags/1.3 includes these lines:

Version: 1.3
Stable tag: 1.3

I honestly don't know where the site is getting the 1.2 information from. Also, FWIW, these two documents might be cleared up a bit:

The standard readme:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/readme.txt
Does not include a reference line for Version (it just includes the Stable line).

This page however:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin
Shows a Version line but not a Stable line

Also, thanks to peeps on this list who tipped me off that phpmailer class was in WP core - that discussion turned into this plugin.

Thanks,
Scot

The version number is read from the main plugin file's header
information (the comment block in the top of your solomail.php).

Using tags + readme can get confusing.

Readme in trunk is parsed, which then points to a specific tagged
version. Then the header from that tagged version is used to indicate
current version number.

This is probably something you should use a postmeta value for instead of a
shortcode, considering how you want to fetch it.

If you need to use a shortcode then the easiest way is probably using a
search query with new WP_Query(), and searching for the most common part of
your shortcode. That will return all posts with the shortcode and not just
one, but unless you are somehow enforcing that only one post can have the
shortcode you should assume more than one does.

	taxonomies
Message-ID: <AANLkTinuEwL3B5G-SnudyMkXGbPsLRJ7AFyV18Jq3p1m@mail.gmail.com>

Hey there!

I'm getting some trouble here with a plugin I'm developing which works with
a custom registered taxonomy and then generates posts listings querying more
than of those terms at once.
The taxonomy is hierarchical and I want to show on the sidebar only the
terms who was items (posts), but I don't really care if the post is in the
term itself, in a first-level child or or deep inside the navigation tree.

It should be so simple as querying get_terms() with the args hide_empty = 1
and hierarchical = 1 (default), but the mix doesn't seem to be working
properly. Instead, it returns me the terms which have posts and the terms
whose direct childrens have posts, but if the post is into a child of a
child, I got nothing.

Any idea on how to get this working properly?
This ticket seems to be about something closely related, but no specifics
are given: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16240

I basically need to navigate the taxonomy tree all the way thorugh in order
to see if are there any posts at any level below the current term. I tried
some tricks around the get_terms filter but couldn't get it working.

Any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks in advance!!

Regards,
Cesar.

readme.txt should not have a Version line only the PHP file needs this

It looks like you fixed this already and it was the usual cause - Version in the PHP file which is what WordPress will display is also what Extend will display regardless of what the tag is called :)

Message-ID: <AANLkTinu=TnWnvXse+B7ZrevtT0xEOsxs4ap=_TQz5jh@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We created a website in 2010, and Media Uploads have been working fine.

We just tried our first upload for 2011 and get the following error:

*?filename.jpg? has failed to upload due to an error*
Unable to create directory
/var/somefilepath/httpdocs/wp-content/uploads/2011/02. Is its parent
directory writable by the server?

Now before saying "Check directory permissions", I'll let you know how it
currently stands:

1) /wp-content/uploads/ has full write permissions, and has been working
fine for creating all the folders in 2010.

2) The system automatically created the 2011 folder when the above upload
failed, and gave it 0777 permissions, and it's owned by Apache (the PHP user
on our system) (all of this is done automatically by WordPress).

3) So "wp-content/uploads" has write permissions. "wp-content/uploads/2011"
was created by WordPress, and has the right permissions. It can't create
wp-content/uploads/2011/02 .. ?

Output of ls -la:
drwxrwxrwx 6 apache apache 4096
drwxrwxrwx 2 apache apache 4096

Then inside 2010:
drwxrwxrwx 3 apache apache 4096
drwxrwxrwx 3 apache apache 4096
drwxrwxrwx 3 apache apache 4096

What am I missing? 2010 worked fine - 2011 has the right + same permissions
set but doesn't work. Sure it must be permission related somehow - but how?

Thanks!

I have a couple of clients that have this issue, and really, it's the host you need to contact.  They have some kind of setting in the Apache configuration that causes this issue (I cannot, for the life of me, recall what that setting is - sorry, I'm only on half a cup of coffee at this early in the morning).  It's not WordPress, it's how the host has the server set up.  To remedy it, you need to contact the host and tell then what the problem is.  They should fix it for you.  if they don't, then you need to find a new host. Otherwise, every month you'll have to go in and set your uploads directory to "777" permissions, upload something, and revert the permissions back. (Which is kind of annoying - especially when you want the client to self-manage the site.)

Most servers have a protection rule that renders all directories with "777"
permission unwritable...

I'm not sure why you couldn't just capture the post ID of the post
running the shortcode and save it in the options table? Have you tried
this? just use

update_option('my_shortcode_page', $post->ID);

Hello,

the latest version is 1.3.3...
But in the admin updates page, i got a notification to update to version

Anyway to fix that?

Hey,

      Just had a quick look at it. Have to say, love it. I was looking into
unit testing for my plugins but basically didn't really get past the first
hurdle of including the WordPress codebase without executing a page load (I
was trying it in CLI). Since I work in an office were Unit Tests seem to be
a dirty words, I couldn't spend too much time investigating it. So big thank
you from me. Now I'm going to spend a day or so building proper tests.

Thanks

Iain

Message-ID: <C24A031A-0F5B-4E12-BE71-9274C93FF9F3@graymerica.com>

All,

One of my clients is trying to change the default behavior of the editor.

Here is their request "All I am wanting is to have you pre-set any hyperlinks to open in a new window. In other words, instead of having the default target set to "Not set" like it currently is, please have it default to "Open Link a New Window" so that we do not have to make that extra step every time we hyperlink text"

Is this possible with a plugin or do I have to hack the core.

I have been able to add items to the target dropdown menu with the following in my functions.php. but no way to set the default to _blank.

function fb_change_mce_buttons( $initArray ) {
    //@see http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/wiki.php/Configuration
    $initArray['theme_advanced_link_targets'] = 'someframe=Some frame;otherframe=Some other frame';
    return $initArray;
    }

add_filter('tiny_mce_before_init', 'fb_change_mce_buttons');

thanks,

Andrew

Do this with javaScript. It may not work all the time do to browsers having it turned off.

wouldn't this be better achieved by some jQuery to open all links 
within the content area in a new window?

then you don't have to worry about what they enter.

Though I assume you have already told them why it is a bad idea?

I just put: <base target='_blank'/> in the <head> element of the site, and
then open in new tab/window is the default behavior for all links.  You
have to explicitly turn it the other way to get it to not open a new link.
 Works like a charm, no JS involved.

This also has the advantage of not overriding link behavior when it is
explicitly set to open in the current window. Using JS to do this would
override this behavior, wouldn't it?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Attaching photos to multiple posts
Message-ID: <63CF7533-2096-4FA5-909D-79E79C7C1A81@gmail.com>

One of the biggest hurdles to overcome, in my opinion, when using  
WordPress as a full-on CMS is the inability to attach photos to  
multiple posts. I've been mulling over a solution for some time, and I  
think I've found an acceptable solution, but I wanted to float it here  
to make sure there wouldn't be any adverse effects.

A few ideas that I've had involve meta data or custom taxonomies, like  
Co-Authors Plus uses. But I thought the best solution might be to  
essentially duplicate the attachment and attach the duplicate  
attachment to the post, so that it degrades gracefully if the plugin  
is deactivated. Essentially, copy over the post (but don't create a  
duplicate image, to save server space). Does anybody anticipate any  
problems?

Thanks,
Will

Message-ID: <4D49D5EF.7020203@skyphe.org>

That's exactly how I did it in my File Gallery plugin :)

Each attachment copy gets a meta key '_is_copy_of' (value = original 
attachment ID ), and each 'original' attachment gets a meta key 
'_has_copies' (value = array with IDs of all of its copies).

(shameless plugin link: <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/file-gallery/>)

I'd also like to know if anyone has any problems with this method, or 
suggestion of a better way to do it.


cheers ;)

But I thought the best solution might be to essentially duplicate the attachment and attach the duplicate attachment to the post, so that it degrades gracefully if the plugin is deactivated. Essentially, copy over the post (but don't create a duplicate image, to save server space). Does anybody anticipate any problems?

I've often thought there needs to be a better solution. Something better than having an image be a child or the parent post. Mainly because I came from using other CMS systems where they manage this different. And from the functional perspective like I want to change the image which is used across multiple pages. Or for example I see an image in the Media section and want to know that posts reference this image in the post_content. This is not built in functionality but is pretty easy to determine. 

Then again the user does have access to all images used on the site. Having that one to one association with a parent does not prevent using that image in multiple post. So for inserting images the user doesn't really care that one image is associated with a page or post and which image are not. 

I really don't see that creating duplicate entries in the database will be any more efficient. Not to mention cleanup when an image is deleted from the system. Sure this can be done. But the question should be why. 

Final answer -1.

What exactly do you need that for? What's the use case?

We don't embed images in posts, we query the post's attachments and  
display them above the article and in a sidebar (see: http://new.bangordailynews.com/2011/02/02/news/bangor/roads-deserted-offices-closed-as-weekly-storm-hits-maine/) 
. This is important for for several reasons, mainly that the content  
is then pushed to our print edition and I don't want to have to worry  
about stripping out cutlines and credits, also so that we can display  
different-sized images on our homepage (http:// 
new.bangordailynews.com/) , etc. We don't embed anything in the text  
of the story and instead use attachments to make sure all data is  
properly fielded.

I'd add that it's fairly standard for newspapers to avoid embedding  
images in content in order to avoid problems with going across  
platforms.

These ae all good ideas.  I was just wondering what the best method is and
it seems to me that using wp_query looks like it would be the best method.
Hooking into save posts seems like overkill, having the shortcode get its id
when it runs ane saves it to a setting isn't a bad idea but won't work until
someone accesses the page to execute the shortcode.

Thanks all for your input.

I've done something similar, but I use the Shiba Media Library plugin. It puts tags on images, and you can create galleries via tags.  You can also pop images into posts by tag.  So instead of copying images over and over and attaching them to posts, you can just tag them and reuse them. She has another Gallery plugin that goes with it, so you can create galleries by tag and manage them easily.

Okay, that's great, but I'm not seeing why you can't just upload the
image again to attach it to another post? What's the issue with that?
Disk space?

What I mean is, what exactly would attaching an "attachment" to more
than one post really enable you to do? Because there's probably a
better way to do it than using attachments at all, in that case. Off
the top of my head, provide a selection mechanism that saves
"attached" images as postmeta. Or tag images and use some kind of
taxonomy scheme. Half a dozen different ways.

You need to define the problem before defining how to solve it. What
is the problem that you're wanting to solve here? Do you want some way
to select images from a thumbnail UI and have those then "attached" to
that post in some manner? Or what?

Message-ID: <AANLkTikwKr1pK10jrXF+G_Tkqfw=BhBOvwxF3ZbaOXPr@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking to add rewrite rules for my plugin, my plugin will have a
shortcode embedded in a page, lets just say for example the url is
http://mysite.com/page I want a rewrite rule to get a url like this
http://mysite.com/page/something-here where something-here is a GET
parameter, it woul dbe like the url
http://mysite.com/page/?something=something-here, you get my point the page
will accept a GET parameter and I just want to rewrite the URL to make it
look better.  First off, my guess is yes, but just to make sure this is
possible right?  And the big question is how?  I haven't worked with rewrite
rules in wordpress before, now if I was to use .htaccess the rewrite rule
would look like this:

RewriteRule ^page/([^/]*)$ /page/?something=$1 [L]
How do I add this to the WordPress rewrite rules?

Why even upload it again? Can't you just choose it from the media library?

He specified "attaching" it to the post without actually having the
image embedded into the post's content. An attachment, as it is, only
can have one parent.

On uploading it again: That's a lot of extra work (finding the image,  
uploading it, editing the cutline and crop, etc.) that a lot of  
newsrooms don't have.

Jane: On choosing it from the media library: You can't select a photo  
from the media library that's attached to another post except to embed  
it. As mentioned below, we don't embed images.

Otto: I mentioned postmeta and taxonomies earlier. Two reasons I  
rejected these were that oftentimes we want to edit the caption  
between two different use cases (for example, a photo of our governor  
on one story might have a full description of what he's doing, while  
the other might just simply state his name and use the photo for  
illustrative purposes; and that we would want to order the photos as  
well, which can certainly be done with postmeta and taxonomies but not  
as easily as, for example, defining menu_order.

The problem is as follows: For our purposes (and I understand this  
probably isn't a core feature) we need an easy way to attach file  
photos to posts (for example, on many continuing stories we'll use the  
same photo three, four, five times). As I mentioned already, uploading  
it multiple times is rather cumbersome.

Thanks for your thoughts thus far already.

Usually when a server blocks 777 perms, its because 775 will suffice and  
777 is plain insecure.
There is a chance something changed on the server setup in the last month  
to cause this, but WordPress should detect that and not set it to 777..
Perhaps the OP should try 775 or 755 and see if that corrects the problem?

I assume that means that once 3.1 is out the door, this will get another

So presumbably  the built in POT generation uses those scripts?

I've been having some problems in my plugin and translators unable to 
translate a call that used _n
eg:
sprintf(_n('<span>%d</span> product in cart.','<span>%d</span> 
products in cart.',$eshopsize,'eshop'),$eshopsize);

Using Poedit, it wasn't keeping the plural form when I do an update. 
Using the online one does include the correct plural:

#: eshop-widget.php:44 eshop-widget.php:164 eshop-shortcodes.php:44
msgid "<span>%d</span> product in cart."
msgid_plural "<span>%d</span> products in cart."
msgstr[0] ""
msgstr[1] ""

but does not add what I think to be a necessary header - ie.
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=1;\n"

(or similar)

am I correct in thinking that that header should be in the POT file?

Ok, but what can I do to make this happen in the meantime? Do I wait 
until Nacin has some spare time for this? Or can I start on something 
already and lessen his burden ;)

Since there's already a patch submitted, I think it's now just a matter of
waiting until a member of the core commit team can address it. Regardless, I
don't think it will get released until 3.2 (unless you're running trunk, in
which case you'll be able to use it sooner, I suppose).

little knowledge I have. :)

It's not included in wordpress.pot, so I guess not.

Plural-Forms header depends on the language, so it's up to translators
to include the proper header when translating.

Hey Ryan, check out this page in the Codex.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite

WordPress has two key filters for this:
rewrite_rules_array (actually adds the rewrite rule)
query_vars (adds rewrite rule/variable to the wp_query object)

Cheers,

Mike

I actually did something very similar to that on a recent project. I
was linking Posts to Pages using the Posts2Posts plugin. The client
then wanted to be able to drill down to specific categories, so I
created a custom rewrite endpoint. Going to
yoursite.com/pagename/articles/category-1 showed posts that were
linked to the current page and also in category 1.

Here's some additional resources that helped me:

Well, I never have spare time :) but... there was a patch submitted, but it
was really large and had a lot of code churn, and ultimately, the
abstraction and implementation there is going to be very, very subjective.
We need some time to figure out exactly how we want to do it.

Obviously, custom post types have already received that direction. But
there's then comment types, comment statuses, and post statuses (just to
name three things), and we haven't thought through any of those yet. I
imagine you'll probably see comment statuses get some work done in 3.2, and
I do hope to get to post statuses as well, but we'll see. Ultimately, there
needs to be a lot of developer buy-in for it to occur, complete with a full
API that a number of us can get behind.

Once 3.1 is out, we'll be scoping out 3.2 in a project meeting. I would
definitely try to justify why it's needed and what the use cases are, which
can help us decide to back it and also begin to figure out the direction of
the feature.

Cheers,
Nacin

If I add that line it failed, if they add it via poedit GUI it worked. 
So thanks you were spot on.

One problem is that you can't have your cake and eat it too.

Allowing a photo to be associated with more than one post at a time means
that you can't edit the caption. And yes, coming from journalism, I
absolutely see the use case in associating the caption with the distinct
point of attachment of the photo, rather than the photo itself.

That leads me to the next point, which could be that uploading it again
might actually be the most painless way to do it. That allows you to crop or
scale things as well as customize captions and metadata. (Even media credit
could be customized at the point of attachment, rather than the photo; for
example, over time a photo might become a 'file photo' rather than the
original photographer, which sometimes the policy in media organizations.)

The solution? I'm not sure, but I see it less as a technical one and more as
one that is custom to your particular implementation.

Perhaps a method that allows copying of attachments -- the record is
inserted as a new attachment and new files are generated. But you can still
keep them linked via postmeta fields and synchronize the data you
specifically want, whenever you wish to modify one or the other. That keeps
the burden down of downloading then uploading a file whenever you want to
reuse it.

I also like the simple approach of tying attachments to posts not only via
post_parent but also with postmeta on the parent post. (Taxonomy works too.)
Then to get attachments tied to a post, you'd query by postmeta value
instead. This doesn't break the conventions of how WordPress stores
attachments, but still provides the ability of not needing to embed images
in post content. You still have issues with attachments but perhaps that's
another thing that can go into postmeta.

I agree strongly with Otto that it isn't about the solution, it's about the
problem. Identify exactly what you want to achieve, and then find a solution
that fits your needs. If our use cases are close, I'd be willing to work on
this as well, as I'd like to leverage it myself somewhere, so let me know
offline.

Hope that helps,
Nacin

Thanks for your response, Andrew. I agree, the problem needs to be  
more thoroughly defined, and I definitely want to hear others' use  
cases so a plugin can be built that solves as many as possible as  
eloquently as possible.

Where are those classes set actually? I tried to use them in media
iframe, where I add some controls and it seems to function the opposite
way. hide-if-js is displayed and hide-if-no-js hidden.

They're set by Javascript in the body:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/admin-header.php#L94
You'll need to check the source code of the iframe to ensure that the  
proper JS is there.

That works in conjunction with this CSS:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/css/global.dev.css#L198

Honestly, I have to say, It's a pretty ingenious solution IMO, As long as  
both the CSS, The Javascript, And the body classes exist, it all just  
works..

I found it in admin-header.php:

...
<body class="wp-admin no-js <?php echo apply_filters(
'admin_body_class', '' ) . " $admin_body_class"; ?>">
<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
(function(){
var c = document.body.className;
c = c.replace(/no-js/, 'js');
document.body.className = c;
})();
//]]>
</script>
...

But there seems to be no such block inside wp_iframe() function, I
guess that's why it doesn't work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Registered User with Community Approval
Message-ID: <6660852107918713607@unknownmsgid>

I am developing a site that is going to have several features and some
functionality that I haven't seen available in a Plugin before. So I'm
planning out the best ways to do this and I'd love some feedback as to
whether I'm on the right track.

I want anyone to be able to register with the site. There will be two
types of accounts a paying account and a free account.

Free Account
You will have the ability to join the site, and create 1 post.  That
user can edit that post forever but can never have more than 1 post.
For this I figure I'll just create a user meta table and if they have
one post associated with their account it would disable the "add a
post" functionality. However it might be better to auto create a post
when the user registers and have the add a new post disabled from the
beginning.

Now for this free user they have a 30 day period where they have to
get community approval to stay on the site.  So they will have to
update their post with relative content and show that they add value
to the site and then in that 30 days get 3 other users to "approve"
them to stay on the site, otherwise their account gets disabled.  My
thought here is to just alter the new user table I created to show a
count on how many approvals they have received and also their account
start date.  If they don't receive three approvals in 30 days I just
change the users password and turn their post to a draft.  I don't
want to dump every thing at this point because they may have a second
chance opportunity.

Paid Account
I was thinking of using a simple Membership Plugin, but the only
difference is that they aren't going to be paying me but rather making
a donation to a charity that the site partners with.  This donation is
a form of verification to join the site that everyone can feel good
about.

These accounts also get a up to 3 posts at any given time but run off
the same premise as the free account,

I guess my main question is about the community approval.  Has anyone
done this before or can you think of a better way of doing this?

Yes, WordPress is applying to GSoC again this year.  As for interest in 
the task, I would recommend trying to *build* interest by pointing out 
what the benefits will be, where we are currently lacking in this area, 
etc.  Write it all up here for now and let people help you flesh out 
your proposal (which you will turn in once WordPress is accepted to GSoC 
and we start taking student applications).

not ??

As a general comment to all potential applicants: The ideas presented on  
the wiki are just that, ideas. If there is something in WordPress which  
you feel you can enhance, or a functionality which could be added, which  
is of significant size that it'd be ideal for a project, -Do not hesitate  
to write a proposal on it- All decent proposals from people who appear to  
be good candidates will be looked at closely, and if they can make a  
compelling case, there -will- be someone who will mentor the project.

But remember, SoC 2011 has just been announced, WordPress has not even  
submitted an application yet. Little thought has been put into potential  
projects by developers yet (All focus is on 3.1).

Please also look at last years projects as well as the ideas page, a  
number of them (including Move WordPress) were attempted.

Message-ID: <AANLkTim6VWy4wX32mphx+1_8i4vRKTwpf7vSib_xKf2e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have been looking at Diaspora development in the past 2 months and I feel
like it will be relatively simple to develop something like that on
BuddyPress/WordPress.
Apart from the distributed social network benefit, it can help in
maintaining larger WordPress sites having multiple servers, one in every
region closer to their customers/users.
Is there any user group already attempting this?

I don't know of anyone currently doing this, but I've floated the idea
around a few people several times this past quarter.  If you have any
further information (i.e. if anyone contacts you explaining their efforts),
please share with the rest of us.

Being able to integrate BuddyPress networks, even just a little bit, goes a
significant way in helping to grow the BuddyPress ecosystem.

I was planning to put this up for my GSoC proposal this year but I highly
doubt if we can do this in such a short span. We can have a planned protocol
and start working on it for sure. So, if anyone's interested in making and
implementing the diaspora protocol or know about any group involved in the
like, do reply!!

Also, if we successfully build this, I dont think we'll have the need for
any move WordPress plugin coz it'll be just adding a second node in the
system, transferring all data(syncing) and disconnecting the first node.
Looking at it from the other side, if we have some ground work on "move
WordPress", we can definitely start from there.

WordPress allows for its database abstraction layer (the wpdb class) to be
extended or replaced.

Sometimes this is used to add a caching layer, or provide support for
multiple databases and even datacenters (see HyperDB). In other cases it can
be used to replace the database engine entirely. There's a plugin offering
PostgresSQL support, as well as a few other engines I believe. There's also
a patch (by Microsoft) offering SQL Server support, but this could just as
easily be implemented as a plugin (and we're working with them to make it
one).

You're right, flavors of queries can cause issues, but the queries in 
the core are pretty generic. Supporting both MyISAM and InnoDB helps 
keeps them that way.  I wrote a WordPress abstraction layer for 
Interbase/Firebird back in 2006 just to see how it was done and the only 
hangup I had was that WordPress expects to get record counts returned 
along side query results and Firebird did not do that.  I added an extra 
function to handle that and was on my way.

Plugins are another issue. You will likely have problems with the 
specific purpose plugins where developers just went in and got the job 
done, ignoring the API for whatever reason they had at the time.

In the end, with a vast vast majority of servers having MySQL installed 
as their database engine, the question isn't "Should we depend upon 
MySQL?", but "Does anyone see enough bang for the buck for them to 
maintain another engine for 5+ years?".  Microsoft obviously did and was 
able to create the code to do it. Engines like Firebird are open sourced 
and would have allowed MUCH more sophisticated database handling years 
earlier. There are still queries in MySQL that cause me to beat my head 
on the table top because they were soooo much more easily done in 
Firebird even a decade ago, but there simply isn't an outcry for other 
DB engines.  What we have works and works well.

With NoSQL picking up craze, postgre gaining popularity and WordPress moving
towards being a complete CMS, its a move that we should make.
Propel might be a good option, may be DAOs.
But this option is good for progress of the CMS as a whole.
I bet people will start discovering new areas for improvement within the
core as they implement database abstraction.

It's not something we are interested in supporting any more that we do at the moment really.

Supporting just mysql out of the box makes it much simpler to test.

Adding <N> other databases to the supported list just multiplies the testing requirements for little gain - most WAMP and LAMP hosts have mysql on them

Will they?  Admittedly anything that causes people to look at code again 
can do that, but would it introduce any major improvements? Remember - 
every feature that isn't supported in MySQL and all our "supported" 
database engines would be excluded from use..  Heck, we can't even 
generically use features that require MySQL 5.0 yet (assuming 3.1 hasn't 
dropped before I hit send).

I'm really curious to see how having access to stored procedures, 
triggers, views will affect the WordPress Core.  I wonder where that 
rabbit trail will lead us.

May be using DAOs will help. we can push all functionality to the DAO of the
respective db layer and simple inbuilt functions from the specific vendor
can be used where needed and in other databases, the same features can be
implemented at the code level??
Just an idea yet. but it seems good to me.
1 factory, 1 PDO or similar base class and few interfaces and their mysql
implementation will get us to where we currently stand with MySQL, we might
not actually need whole ORMs etc

The issue of too many platforms to test is mitigated if all of the SQL calls
are encapsulated in wpdb -- right now, that's not the case.  If you get to
that point, I still think that you only develop WordPress to function on
MySQL, then leave it up to the third-party people to do the swap-out and
testing for their specific platforms.

You don't have to encapsulate the SQL calls just ensure that they are only made via WPDB as we do at the moment.

db.php drop-ins exist which rewrite the SQL to match another databases SQL.

Moreover, they are ideas from last year. Some have been implemented, 
some have proven to be better as plugins, and some never happened. We'll 
be working up a new ideas list for this year in the next couple of weeks.

Yes, we're tried a couple of times to get this off the ground, but we 
don't have a lot of contributors focused on accessibility.

Why not just take it to the point where we make a clean interface and
implement it in mysql and let the users write and share their implementation
for other databases. with time and testing, we can choose to integrate the
more popular and stable ones?
btw wont using the db.php need making something close to having POT kinda
files for queries for dbmses which have different SQL (oracle can be a good
example though am not sure if anyone will use it)

Message-ID: <896238d4-7965-42c5-9907-f357ef116139@r19g2000prm.googlegroups.com>

Some discussion has been made on the WordPress Core Trac regarding
supporting other database types, though it appears that the direction
that WordPress core has taken is against supporting other database
types comes at the cost of increasing the amount of effort in either
rewriting functions and / or RegEx-ing your way through the barriers
that the MySQL only support WordPress currently restricts itself to.
Yes, many developers have gone through this and built solutions of
many different types, but it doesn't compare to what real integration
could bring, or additional provisions within Core for these efforts.

Any attempt to abstract WordPress beyond MySQL will only waste core
dev time as they have to then explain why they won't be making any
changes. I apologize for my own time wasting on that end - I believe
some sort of page in the Codex or About section of the WP.org should
compile the full explanation of the reasoning behind the MySQL-only
support WP core has restricted itself to with some sort of evidence in
favor of that restriction, offering up additional resources to plugins
which were developed to support other engines that have been
recommended by core devs or other respectable devs / firms in the WP
community.

There's much to be done, calling WP a full blown CMS right now is
tough, since many people's idea of 'full' can be different. In this
database discussion, a great question rises yet again as it has over
the past many years of WP's life.

Will there be some form of redemption by core as more community
members speak out in favor of additional support? No one can tell, at
least not for the very near future. We'll see how the  WordPress
landscape changes over the next few years. For now, your only hope is
to prove them wrong -- that people want to use these other database
engines -- with solid proof of why it would be a good addition to core
and the impact it could have in making WordPress better for more
people than just MySQL alone. Think of your task as being a prosecutor
in a court case, WordPress is the defendant, and you've got to
persuade the jury (Core Devs and major contributors) to see the future
and what they're doing by limiting growth.

That's my two dollars anyways.. I've been from the bottom to top of
the Core Dev ladder, the answer is the same all around -- They simply
don't have this as a priority or even in sights for the next few years
and for it to happen we will need to orchestrate this as a community
effort to prove to them that it is a priority. I know right now, it
seems like we're protesting about the war in Vietnam (US History), but
we can only make a difference if it's truly what the community wants
and is the 'right' choice to expand the use of WordPress and it's
ability to perform to meet the needs of everyone who it can benefit.

Good luck until then, just say "I think I can", sorry for the video -

Using a db.php drop-in is good enough for a proof of concept though 
isn't it? HyperDB is a good example of how do start this.  It extends 
wpdb and overrides db_connect:
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/hyperdb/trunk/db.php

Just swap in NewADOConnection for mysql_connect and Bob's your uncle.    
Ok so you'll want to do more than that, but if the proof of concept 
spread like wildfire, there would be more people interested in coding a 
more closely integrated solution.

The good reasons(if any) for people to want to change to other dbms will
surely be overriden by the regex in the HyperDB implementation.

oh, I dont think I can work my way through the talking with core devs and
contributors and explaining/realizing why or why not to support more dbmses
What I can do is, complete the layer on a fork of wordpress on github with
some help and may be hope for the core devs to pull that in as the work is
already done. I can work on it as a GSoC project and lend a helping hand.

As far as I know, in regex vs rewrite, rewrite wins hands down in
performance, cleaner codes, decoupling. and I dont need numbers/tests to
prove that. now the fact that almost all people use wordpress with MySQL and
the core devs donot feel the need to implement the layer, imho is kind of
mutual. people wont know/use any product for something that the product
doesn't support out of the box / with some simplistic plugin. if they need
another dbms so bad and donot get a simple solution for it, they can simply
switch to another CMS/framework that supports it or if they really love wp,
they'll probably make hacks better than adding db.php(obviously putting them
out of the updates cycle) so this MySQL only trend can go on forever. :(

Right, in my experience using a CMS is like buying a home. You know
you may eventually move so you're willing to make some concessions,
but if it's missing something you absolutely want then you're more
than likely going to look at other houses that have it over taking a
house that doesn't. For businesses, it's sort of the same thing since
people looking at a CMS look for certain features that they need, if a
CMS doesn't have it then they're going to move onto other ones that do
- and WP never knows about it because they glance at WP and it's
requirements and say "That can't do that", regardless of the existence
of some complicated installation process to get it to do what they
want. You could almost compare this to life before Custom Post Types,
in which you could just use Pages or Posts with categories for
everything. Yeah, you could get it done - but it's not an efficient
solution - it's a hack.

Does the code at http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/ remain at the current
development revision of WordPress? I can start the move from my end by
cloning that into a github repo, work on it and developers who want the
change can fork>update and send pull requests, if the core devs see the move
and understand the need of the change, they can move it back to svn/any new
versioning system that WP is planning? As Scott pointed out, "I think I can"

Actually, trunk is the current version of whatever's being developed,
right now that's 3.1 - though I must warn you that if you do fork this
on github and put your work into this - there is a very slim chance
your work will be considered for core. The only good you're probably
doing here is that you're giving other people a good starting point at
doing something similar. So don't walk into this thinking it's going
to get into core, walk into this as you're taking one of the first
steps towards showing how this can be done.

WP will likely remain on SVN for some time to come, though there are
internal talks of other options which involves a considerable amount
of time that may or may not make it feasible in the near future.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Network and Plugin Availability
Message-ID: <AANLkTikevWT96zhH5WaCR5A6eoD-tywrgZVZ5ARo-DHU@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All

Thanks in advance for the help on this one.

I see using the WordPress Network or Multisite functionality we can decide
on specific themes to make "active" for specific sites.  However if we
enable the ability for site owners to access plugins they get access to
every plugin on the install.

Is there a way to give specific sites, options to specific plugins.  I don't
want all site owners to be able to activate all the plugins installed on the
server.  For example I want site A to be able to active plugins 1 and 2 and
for site B to be able to activate plugins 2 and 3 because maybe plugin 1 and
3 don't work well together or for countless other reasons.

Jesse

Jimmy this is the wrong venue for your question. I recommend the official
support forums instead:

Apart from opening and checking all files individually, is there any better
way to figure out all sql queries in all files? may be regex

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can I register admin pages that are NOT in the menu?
Message-ID: <4D51C329.802@gmail.com>

I am currently working on a plugin for managing branches and branch 
locations (part of a larger integration).

On the admin side, I only want a single item in the menu:
* Branches [admin.php?page=myplugin-list]

I need to have other pages, such as adding new branches, editing 
branches, adding locations for branches, etc, but I do not want those 
pages in the menu.
* admin.php?page=myplugin-add
* admin.php?page=myplugin-edit&id=123
* admin.php?page=myplugin-add-location&id=123
* admin.php?page=myplugin-edit-location&id=456

I have been searching the Codex and scouring the rest of the net for 
info on how to do this, but I haven't had any luck. I've found others 
who want to do the same thing, but they never got any answers either.

Is it possible to register a page for a plugin without adding it to the 
admin menu?

Or do I need to do something like:
* admin.php?page=myplugin&action=list
* admin.php?page=myplugin&action=add
* admin.php?page=myplugin&action=edit&id=123
* admin.php?page=myplugin&action=add-location&id=456

I'd rather not do that, but if it's my only option ...

I did something simular for a plugin of mine.  What I did is register a
queryvar and I had one page that would differ depending on the value of the
queryvar.

Sorry I didn't read the whole thing at first and didn't realize you didn't
want to do that if possible.  I know there are plugins that can hide specfic
admin menu items, if you look at one and see how they hide menus you could
always do that.

You can use the all_plugins filter to remove it from the list.

function cws_deny_akismet( $plugins ) {
	if ( !is_super_admin() && isset( $plugins['akismet/akismet.php'] ) )
		unset( $plugins['akismet/akismet.php'] );
	return $plugins;
}

add_filter( 'all_plugins', 'cws_deny_akismet' );

This doesn't actually deny them from activating it, but without it
present in the UI they won't know the nonce required to activate it.
So it seems effective, at first glance.

And obviously, you can run logic so that the above code is run in a
mu-plugins file and conditionally removes certain plugins from the
list of available plugins, based on which site admin is being
accessed.

Can anyone find a flaw in this approach? Can you find another way to
activate the plugin?

This will work perfectly for me. I just need to protect site owners
from themselves.  They aren't the most technical people.

I'll implement this and see what I can do to activate a Plugin
afterwards and let you all know.

Thanks Mark!

Message-ID: <4D529378.3090709@elfden.co.uk>

Hi,

Just had my internet connection go down, first time in quite a while, 
but I noticed an extreme slowdown of WordPress this seems to be caused 
by a call to class-http.

Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in 
E:\htdocs\wpbeta\wp-includes\class-http.php on line 1420

which is this:
$theResponse = curl_exec( $handle );

temporarily changing that to ='' does solve the issue, but obviously 
that is just a quick workaround.

Is there any method to totally disable it if/when necessary?

I know I can create my own button - which I'm doing. But I'd really like to
override the Link button to do what I'd like it to do - namely, to create
Bit.ly links instead of standard.

Is that possible? Or is this a better question for TinyMCE forums?

Thanks.

Any idea what was making the call to the HTTP class?  Because *that's* where
you'll want to add a workaround ...

well yes... but trying to identify what is calling it isn't easy. Or 
rather identify and block.

However...

looks to be exactly what I was after, thanks. Will try next time I 
lose connection.

Hi Thomas,

Out of interest - why would you like to do this?

Bit.ly is a great service when you need to shorten the URL (Twitter for
example, or TXT emails), however surely if it's part of the link button,
then the full URL will do?

Maybe if we know your reasons, we can suggest a better solution?

I know I can create my own button - which I'm doing. But I'd really like
to
override the Link button to do what I'd like it to do - namely, to
create
Bit.ly links instead of standard.

Is that possible? Or is this a better question for TinyMCE forums?

Thanks.

Thanks for the reply, Gavin. My motivation is for a number of reasons:

   1. Using Bitly Pro, I have a custom shortening domain and it would be
   nice to push most of my links that direction.
   2. Tracking CTR for all my links - from posts, from Twitter, from
   FaceBook - would be a real convenience.
   3. I'm working on availing myself of the Bitly API to do more fancy,
   paper.li, type stuff on the blog. One location for all links would be
   hugely helpful in this regard.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=rXKh2zM2PmqZGH2vQomzKkX7pGuwuT5OnwW4T@mail.gmail.com>

Need some basic help,

why sometimes add_action("manage_posts_custom_column", "my_custom_columns");
simply don't fire?

Since add_filter("manage_edit-podcast_columns", "my_podcast_columns");
always fire.

Thanks in advance

After 3 days, finally figured what is the problem:

on register_post_type, hierarchical must be set to false
to add_action("manage_posts_custom_column"... properly fires!

Thanks anyway guys!

To be accurate there are too hooks. Depends on how your Post Type is setup

For Posts (hiearchical)
add_action("manage_posts_custom_column", "my_custom_columns");

Pages (non-hiearchical)
add_action("manage_pages_custom_column", "my_custom_columns");

Pages are hierarchical and posts are not.

We'll start the ideas list for this year in a couple of weeks, after 
we've identified mentors. See wpdevel.wordpress.com.

Try using the YOURLS plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yourls-wordpress-to-twitter/ 
. I believe you have have it return shortlinks for bit.ly.

Note: code examples are taken from the WP-Bitly
Plugin<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-bitly>
.

It's actually pretty straight-forward; you merely need to hook your own
shortlink into the get_shortlink filter:

add_filter( 'get_shortlink', 'wpbitly_get_shortlink', 10, 3 );


Then, you merely need to define your own shortlink. (Reference the WP-Bitly
Plugin to see how we did it.)

Note, you need to unhook the wp.me shortlink provided by the WordPress.com
Stats Plugin, if active:

remove_action( 'wp',      'wpme_shortlink_header' );
remove_action( 'wp_head', 'wpme_shortlink_wp_head' );


It's actually pretty easy. If you want a lighter code example, Yoast has
also released a bit.ly Plugin that filters the shortlink button.

Let's not focus on Bit.ly.

Does anyone know how to override the Link button, or if it's even possible.
Why I want to do it is irrelevant.

Sorry; misunderstood you. You meant the TinyMCE hyperlink button; I thought
you meant the post shortlink button.

I'm not sure how to filter existing TinyMCE buttons, but I assume that there
must be a way.

The advlink plugin for TinyMCE overrides the link button - you could take a
look and see how it does that (don't know enough to break it down myself).

Internal linking in 3.1 relies on using the regular link button as far as I
can tell though, so if you override it, you'll lose the internal linking
piece if/when you make the jump. Just tried it myself by replacing with
advlink.

Why not just unset the regular link button and put your custom button there
instead? If you use the same icon, a user probably won't know the difference
anyway.

Message-ID: <3EF46DD7-26CF-4980-B570-6B48ADF522EA@gmail.com>

Being able to set custom image sizes is awesome, but I think one  
simple feature could make it even more powerful. On our site we have a  
number of different sizes for the thumbnails of an image ( 75px, 150px  
and 250px) that we use around the site. The problem is that if we  
recrop the thumbnail it doesn't filter down to the 75px and 150px  
versions. It would be great if you could specify a size of the image  
the custom size is supposed to correspond with (such as thumbnail) so  
that when editing crops they can carry over.

If this is something people are interested in I can submit a patch for  
3.2.

Will

Is this something that would be handled by, e.g. the Regenerate

Or are you talking about something different?

Message-ID: <99c7b56f-f67b-4c55-9a56-00ba218dd1c5@a8g2000pri.googlegroups.com>

Hi list,

i just answered a question about assigned post types for taxonomies on
wordpress.stackexchange [1], that needed to get the data from the
$wp_taxonomies array. I found working with it to be pretty non-handy.

From bogus@does.not.exist.com  Wed Feb  9 07:26:26 2011

Subject: No subject
Message-ID: <mailman.0.1297349182.12452.wp-hackers@lists.automattic.com>

custom taxonomy equal with category (key = 0), post tag (1), nav_menu
(2) & link_category(3) - they are still taxonomies, but from nearly
every use case with the wp_taxonomies array it's just ... non-handy.
In most cases you won't set the build in taxonomies equal to your
custom ones. You registered them, because the build in stuff didn't
fit your needs. With the current setup there's the need for some ugly
work arounds/hacks to exclude the build in taxonomies. It would really
make sense if custom taxonomies would reside in only one array (key 4)
and therefore be easier accessible/loop-able. Going one step further
and registering this new array as a separate global available $var
would make even more sense.

So here goes my question to all people who have enough in-depth
knowledge: Would this be possible or is $wp_taxonomies that deeply
nested, that changing this is impossible?

Thanks.
- Kaiser.

Ps.: As you can read in my statement before the code, i wrote it
without testing. I hope the guy who asked the question will edit my
code and replace it with his, so don't kill me for this (verbally).

$wp_taxonomies is internal, private. Use get_taxonomies() instead.

If you want to override built-in taxonomies, be aware that isn't currently
supported, and the sky may fall on your head.

Thanks Nacin,

but you misunderstood me slightly. I didn't want to override anything,
just help someone. If you look at the code in the provided link,
you'll see that i simply wanted to get only not built in taxonomies.
Someone else already pointed me at the "_builtin" $arg of which i
wasn't aware.

Just to document what i needed:

// gives you an array of custom taxonomy objects
$custom_taxonomies = get_taxonomies( array('_builtin' => false),
'objects' );
// get all post types that are assigned to a custo taxonomy
$cpt_att_to_tax = array();
foreach ( $custom_taxonomies as $tax ) :
 $cpt_att_to_tax[] = $tax['post_type'];
endforeach;
$custom_post_types = array_unique($cpt_att_to_tax);

ehm... have to write another mail: there's no way around
$wp_taxonomies. Even if it's internal. get_taxonomies() gives you the
taxonomies and allows to differ between builtin and custom types, but
is missing the post types. The original question was "It is possible
to get a list of post types asociated to a taxonomy?". The guy who
asked wanted all unique custom post type names that are assigned to
custom post types, so the original answer on wp stackechange was right
and there's no solution without $wp_taxonomies.

You don't need to ever use $wp_taxonomies, because get_taxonomies() and
get_taxonomy() are API-level functions that expose its information.

Two examples below. They are entirely untested, and there may even be
another API function I'm not thinking about. (For example, if you wanted to
know all taxonomies tied to a post type, then use get_object_taxonomies()).

$tax_object = get_taxonomy( 'my_taxonomy' );
$post_types = $tax_object->post_type;

Or:

$tax_object = get_taxonomies( array( '_builtin' => false ), 'objects' );
$post_types = array();
foreach ( $tax_object as $tax ) {
   $post_types = array_merge( $post_types, $tax->post_type );
}
$post_types = array_unique( $post_types );

get_taxonomies uses $wp_taxonomies internally.

Take another look at the code you posted previously. get_taxonomies is
returning an array of objects, not array of arrays. Secondly, if you
look at register_taxonomy the types you register a taxonomy to are
object types and not post types, i.e. $tax->object_type.

Whilst typing this Andrew replied again. You'll want to use his code,
but $tax->object_type and not $tax->post_type.

@Jon & Nacin: Thanks. That really caused me some headaches.

I ended up with the following:
function get_object_types_unique( $all_r_custom = false ) {
	$tax_object = get_taxonomies( array( '_builtin' => $all_r_custom ),
'objects' );
	if ( $all_r_custom == true )
		$tax_object = array_merge( $tax_object,
get_taxonomies( array( '_builtin' => false ), 'objects' ) );

	$object_types = array();
	foreach ( $tax_object as $tax ) {
		$object_types = array_merge( $object_types, $tax->object_type );
	}

	$object_types = array_unique( $object_types );
	return $object_types;
}
The drawback is that i have to ask the DB for twice to retrieve all,
but it's ok so far.

Not sure if this is the right place for this, if not let me know.

I have a new wordpress install on a MediaTemple DV server.  Everything works
fine except for outgoing emails.

Any email that comes from wordpress (new user accounts, password change
request, etc...) will NOT get delivered to my corporate Google Mail
account.  This is the same for form submissions using the plugin Contact
Form 7.

If I send the emails to my personal gmail account it works perfectly.
However anything sent to our Google Apps Account (basically an email address
ending in your domain but managed by google) will not go through.

I know this is not a WordPress bug but I was wondering if anyone else has
experienced this.  Maybe something in the email headers that google is
picking up, something.  I've tested this up and down across the board with
several email accounts.

The server running wordpress is a totally separate domain from the one in
our email address.  The server never hosted our email accounts so there
aren't any lapsed mx files and it's not trying to handle it internally.

Any help would be appreciate it.

Get the Cimy Swift SMTP plugin to make sure that your sending all the right 
information properly to the google hosted domain apps account.    It's a bit 
more strict then just sending from your local sendmail on the sender 
name/sender email and such being proper.

Correct me if I'm wrong that won't fix the problems with the form plugins
like Contact Form 7.  It's designed to send emails when the php mail
function disabled but that's not the case here.

Works fine for me with contact form 7.   Give it a try, becuase you're 
directing your mail traffic through the google apps, it will help you 
achieve that.

Nothing is stored in the DB. You're working with an internal stateless
array. It's really quick.

Not sure why you're not doing it like this:
(also, always prefix function names)

function nacin_get_object_types_unique( $custom_only = false ) {
       $args = $custom_only ? array( '_builtin' => false ) : array();
       $tax_objects = get_taxonomies( $args, 'objects' );
       ...

Nacin

You're right.

It was an example for stackexchange, not nothing i use myself like
this. So the sky wouldn't fall on _my_ head. Maybe i should do it to
give examples closer to best practice, but that's not part of the
question.

A bunch of hosts are now enforcing *SPF* - Sender Police Framework , so you
must create a mail box with the same domain, just to send emails through
applications.

E.g.

domain -> example.com
mailbox -> sender at example.com

on your contact-form: From: sender at example.com
in additional headers: Return-Path: sender at example.com

That should work because Gmail dont use SPF, but Gmail for domains must use!

Other things to look into:

- reverse DNS for the mail server
- what HELO string does it use when sending mails?
- signing mails with DKIM

It's quite complicated to send emails these days.

Ok, guys.  Can't see how this is either productive for the list or
going in the direction of any sort of issues with WordPress itself.
It would be appreciated to take this off list, or to another
appropriate place of discussion.

Had you setup spf records and if so are they set to allow emails to be sent
by your server?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Role and Custom Post Types
Message-ID: <AANLkTik5ER3xAAfd+w16iX=jb4qEwr4fcG=J+63wvQXR@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks in advance for any help I get with this.

I've defined a new role in wordpress called Designer.
I've create a custom post type called Profile.

Designer needs to have 1 ability and that's to edit a Profile post.

I need to accomplish the following

   - Create a custom Role called "Designer" - DONE
   - I need to limit the capabilities of the Designer to ONLY edit their
   Profile post.  I do not want them to be able to "Add Posts" of any type
   because each Designer is only allowed one Profile Post
   - On registration of a "designer" a custom post "Profile" is created and
   published automatically with the new Designer set as the author
   - The title of this new Profile will be the name of the Designer set by
   the designer upon registration


Problems I'm having

   - It's easy enough to limit the capabilities of the new role to only
   "edit posts" but that actually gives them access to the entire "Posts" admin
   panel which include "add new"
   - How do I define that they can ONLY edit a Custom Post Type rather than
   a simple Post
   - How do I auto create a custom post type upon registration of a new
   user? I figure I can grab the hook that is used for a new user registration
   and just add the post to the database manually.  If this is the best way of
   doing it, I can don't need help with this.

Jesse,

You probably need to pay attention to the capabilities-related
argument of register_post_type:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type#Arguments

I don't know how you're creating the new role - I used Justin
Tadlock's Members plugin, which also allows customization of the
role's capabilities. In tandem with the above arguments, I've been
able to do this kind of thing.

As for creating the new post on registration, yeah, I think you're on
the right track with the new registration hook.

cheers,

Steve Taylor

I just ran this function to define the new role:

//CUSTOM ROLE INFO
add_role( 'sr_webdesigner', 'Web Designer' );

// get the the role object
//$role_object = get_role( 'sr_webdesigner' );

// add $cap capability to this role object
//$role_object->add_cap( 'edit_posts' );

I've been looking into "unset" $submenu for Add New but I can't find the
right submenu item and I'm not sure yet if that will prevent someone from
manually navigating to /post-new.php

I was able to remove the "Add New" from under posts by running the following
function.  However it did NOT remove the "Add New" from the custom post
type.  It also does NOT prevent someone from manually going to post-new.php.
 Thoughts?

function remove_submenus() {
  global $submenu;
  unset($submenu['edit.php'][10]); // Removes 'Tags'.
}

add_action('admin_menu', 'remove_submenus');

I don't know the mechanics of adding new capabilities - just grab the
Members plugin if you can't figure it out. But you need to specify the
capabilities for the new post type in register_post_type, then add
those capabilities to the new role - don't add "edit_posts".

And yeah, removing menu items is an unsatisfactory hack - deal with
capabilities and the rest follows.

This should help with defining custom roles and capabilities, along with his
Members plugin:

Definitely agreed on not fussing with the menu.

The post that Helen has suggested is awesome for understanding the really
powerful meta capabilities part of the capabilities system in WordPress.

For removing the "Add New" links, try this - it will work the same for
custom post types:

Why don't you give them "read" only cap which will allow them to modify
their profile and nothing else and then build a custom profile page?

The profile is just a term but its really a post and needs to be one.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Putting WordPress posts in different Permalink
 Structure, to Custom Post types
Message-ID: <AANLkTins8E33QfePDirbzfa__SC+YSOOfUo1B4-aJ=O3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

How do you set the rewrite slug of a standard WordPress post (but not affect
other Custom Post Types)?

In more detail:

We've been running an install of WordPress at http://www.example.com.

We use the "Post" function to run the news section of the site, therefore we
configured Peramlinks (in Settings) to use: /news/%postname%-%post_id%.

However we now have a custom post type called "events", we've set the
rewrite slug for this to be events: ['rewrite' => array('slug' =>
'webcasts')]

The problem being - the permalink setting is now causing URL's such as
http://www.example.com/news/events, when it should be
http://www.example.com/events.

Obviously removing /news/ from permalinks solves the problem, but then
leaves Posts without the /news/ sub-structure.

How do you set the rewrite slug of a standard WordPress post (but not affect
other Custom Post Types)?

Thanks,
Rob

Hey Robert,

There is an optional argument in the 'rewrite' array called
'with_front'. Set this to false and the /news/ section won't be used
in your custom post type URLs.

There are a couple of other arguments too in the rewrite array that
you might be interested in. See
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type#Arguments
(scroll down to the rewrite section).

I'm working on a site where I have a custom post type that I am allowing
users to both create and edit.  I actually don't let my user touch
wp-admin.  I register a shortcode that I can use in a page to embed a custom
form that my users can use.  Perhaps you could look into doing that aswell.

In addition to that I use thememyprofile to allow user to change their
password and stuff from a frontend page then I block subscribers from
accessing wp-admin alltogether.

Anyway to make it so it doesn't take the filename and save it plus what
looks like a timestamp.

I see in 2.9 IMAGE_EDIT_OVERWRITE was introduced, I set the constant to
true, but still no go, I want to keep the orig filename all the way through?

Thanks.

Ya I find it works well, since they dont have too go to the backend
interface it keeps the site consistent for my users, it avoids the issues
you are having, and since my custom posts also have alot of meta data
associated with them, i can have the form collect the data and save it in a
consistent manner.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Slug URL Problems, with Custom Post Type and Pages
Message-ID: <AANLkTik2omfGUJf4ppJsWAPT-503n7xDroTMsCA=CD5o@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a Custom Post Type "Events", using the slug "events".

So, new events end up at: http://www.example.com/events/event-name

However I now want to create a static page, using WordPress pages, that sits
at: http://www.example.com/events/previous

I've created the Events page, and the Previous page as a child of that.
The permalink given for this Previous page in WP-Admin is:
http://www.example.com/events/previous

However, visting that page URL gives me a 404 error everytime it loads.

I've tried reloading permalinks several times, with no luck. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Rob

The rewrite rule for your custom post type will be matched by
/events/event-name/. WordPress then tries to find an event with the
name 'event-name', which doesn't exist, giving you a 404.

You can get around this by adding a rewrite rule explicitly for
'/events/previous/' which maps to index.php?pagename=previous. Take a
look at the Plugin Hooks section of WP Rewrite [1] if you're not sure
how to do this.

Hi, we are developing a plugin for wordpress and want to output our function 
in a table of data with proper css style and ID's so theme developers can 
style it properly.
We will be outputting a simple table of information, similar to an address 
with name, address, city state, etc.  We may have one address listed, or we 
may have a lot.  So we are looking for somewhere that may list a good 
practice for including the css styles for the table, header, rows, cells 
etc.

thank you

Phil Hart

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=23r3euRfSEd=zjYky=7BfPk11UZmRDTvdQvqR@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Im working on a multi-language plugin for WordPress. Ive written this long
message describing what Ive seen so far and what is my idea of
implementation. If you are interested in it and want to share some ideas,
please read the message below. I would love to get some feedback.


----------

1. What Ive seen

The 2 best plugins Ive seen are Q-Translate and WPML.

Why I dont like them:

Q-Translate -> saves the content of the post int the same post_content field
of the database, separating the languages with html comments.. When the
theme outputs the content of a post, it gets filtered and displays only one
language. Appart from that, this is an excelent plugin. But I junt cant
sleep well at night knowing my database is like this...

WPML -> creates a lot of extra tables in a complex database structure and is
associated with a translating service. In the top of that, the plugin does a
lot more than juts adding the multi language support and claims itself as a
cms solution for wordpress... I like plugin that do only one thing very well
done.

2. How do I think that can be done?

2.1 translating posts

First, I think it can be done without adding any extra table or doing
anything out of the database structure.

The approach Im using is to treat translations as post types. So, for
instance, if I would translate my posts to spanish, there would be the
native "post" post type and the plugin would add the "post_translation_es"
post type.

In the edit posts screen, there would be an extra column called
'translations' that would show for each post if it already have the spanish
translation. If it has, there is a button 'edit', if it dont, 'add'. If you
go to the edit screen of the spanish posts, you would see the same thing,
the other way round.

This part is already coded and working fine.

2.2 translating everything else (appart from taxonomies)

I think its nice to be able to translate everything on the site (The site
title, te text of a text widget, etc). So what Im trying to do is to add a
filter in get_option() and update/add_option() to allways check which
language are we visiting right now (int the front end or the admin, does not
matter) and allways look for a corresponding option in the current language.

For instance.. if you do a get_option('option_name') and are visiting the
spanish site, it will try to find an option called 'option_name_es'. If
there is not, it will get the default. Same thing when saving.

You can have a look at the code here:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multi-language-framework/

edit_screen.php has all the code that handles the extra post type.
wp_options.php has all the code that handles the get_optino/update_option
filters..

Most of the rest is rubbish.. many things copied from Q Translate... this is
just a proof of concept.

If you got all the way here, thanks very much for your attention, please
share your insights

<http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/1552/best-practices-for-localizing-wordpress-content/1589#1589>I
think is the best way for the structures of WordPress and all its possible
with small plugins or hard coded in the theme.

Best of luck Leo - seems good from your description. I agree that
qTranslate are both great but not perfect.

Well, of course they're not perfect, but talking specifically, they
lack something that a major client of mine needs: section-specific
activiation of languages. So you can pick certain pages, and only
those pages and their descendants have the translation stuff applied
to them. And you can select different languages for different
sections.

I tried doing a plugin to adapt qTranslate to do this (by selectively
removing qTranslate's hooks):

http://sltaylor.co.uk/wordpress/plugins/qtranslate-selective/

But it never worked 100%. The client is currently in limbo until I
find time to find another way.

Of course, if you get your plugin up to the standards of qTranslate or
WPML, and include this feature, you'll be my new best friend ;)

Message-ID: <AANLkTinpoAc4F_mUdqWeRZatF3u48q9GTEo9DERBsf_L@mail.gmail.com>

I need to get all users who have a specific capability, I have a function
with this code:

global $wpdb;
$members = array();

// Get all user ID's
$members_search = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->users ORDER BY
ID");

foreach ($members_search as $userid) {
     // Check each user ID, check for cap
     if (user_can($userid,  'manage_options')) {
         $members[] = $userid;
     }
}

return $members;

I was just wondering if there is a better way perhaps?

You could get the user ID's from a DB query like this:

$wpdb->get_results("SELECT user_id FROM $wpdb->usermeta WHERE meta_key =
'wp_capabilities' AND meta_value LIKE '%administrator%' ");

That's the general idea anyway.

Im not basing it off of role though, so that won't work if the user
customizes wp to give other roles the capability.

a couple of years ago i used a plugin called language switcher[1] but it is
no longer maintained[2].

it did a very good job and had lots of good features:

 - shortcodes for multiple languages within post content, and also within
titles, excerpts and custom fields,

 - no extra db tables,

 - when you switched language all menus, dates, theme items, etc. all
changed (assuming you had also installed the relevant wordpress language
file),

 - switching language on the front end automatically switched on the backend
too when you logged in,

 - nice permalinks,

 - language switch buttons,

 - attempted to detect visitor's language from browser settings and set site
to that language,

i'm not sure it works past wordpress 2.9 though, so i'd love to see a new,
maintained plugin that incorporates some of these features, and your custom
post type approach looks really interesting to me. i'll give it a spin in
the next few days.

cheers

hi Leo,
just for info, the guy who developp QTranslate is working on a totally new

Why not get the list of roles which the cap it applied to then?

As you can see, other than some dodgy LIKE on wp_capabilities (Which can  
contain roles AND the user might have a cap Singually outside of the  
role..) or looping over all users, there isnt a way at present.
See: #10201: enhancement: Switch roles to use single role, and no  
user-specific caps - http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10201

Thank you for the link but this doesn't answer my what we're looking for.

We are looking for an example of the class and style naming conventions our 
developer would use to code the table output.  We're not looking for the 
start of the encyclopedia on css.  What were looking for is an example of 
how we should output our table so theme developers can style it as they 
wish.
For instance, should we output:

<table class="staff">
<tr class="person.1"
<td class="facefield.1">
<img class="facepic.1">
</td>
<td class="person.1"
<p class="person.1.name">Name:  </p><p class="person.1.name.text">Joe 
Blow</p>
<p class="person.1.email">Name:  </p><p 
class="person.1.email.text">joeblow at example.com</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="person.2"
<td class="facefield.2">
<img class="facepic.2">
</td>
<td class="person.2"
<p class="person.2.name">Name:  </p><p class="person.2.name.text">Joe 
Blow2</p>
<p class="person.2.email">Name:  </p><p 
class="person.2.email.text">joeblow2 at example.com</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


I have no idea if the above is right, I'm just trying to show example.  We 
aren't sure should and where we should use classes as opposed to styles or 
id's.  We are looking for examples of what theme developers would want us to 
use in our table code so they can apply proper css to the fields we provide.

Thanks!

If you're looking to give theme developers as much control over the
style as possible then here are a few tips:

1. Use semantic markup. This means <thead> and <tbody> elements for
the table heading and body respectively, and <th> elements (instead of
just <td>s) for row and column headers. Many (most) themes will have
CSS rules for styling tables nicely, and using these elements means
the table will look half decent before you've even added any class
attributes to the table.

2. The "person.2.name" class name in your example is terrible. It
means a style sheet would need an infinite number of rules to cover
all possible number of rows. Class names are good though - stick theme
everywhere. If you take out the numbers in the class names in your
example (and replace the dots with dashes or underscores) then you're
well on your way.

3. Put a class name prefixed with the name of your plugin on the
<table> element. This makes it easy to target the specific tables
output by your plugin. For example, awesome_plugin_table.

Beyond that, a good method would be to try to style the table yourself
with CSS. If you find you don't have classes or elements in the right
place then add them in. Don't forget you might want to include <span>s
around any headings in case the theme wants to use an image
replacement technique.

HTH,
John

This is more of a generic CSS question, really. But basically here's
some general guidelines:

- If an item is unique and has a chance of being styled uniquely, give
it a unique ID, one that won't be used anywhere else on the page. In
your example, you used "person.1" as a class. This is wrong, because
there's only one person with person.1. You should have used person-1
as an ID on the main wrapper.

- A class should be generic and shared. In your example of
"person.1.name", that's a terrible class design. A better way would be
to put just "person" on the td wrapper, then "name" on the p wrapper
around the name. This could then be referenced in CSS as td.person
p.name, for all of the person names.

- Use of dots in classnames like you did is bad. Use dashes, like
some-thing instead. But still, you shouldn't have multiple information
classes like that anyway.

Here's a better example of correct semantic markup:

<table class="staff">
<tr class="person" id="person-1">
<td class="face">
<img class="pic">
</td>
<td class="info"
<p class="label name-label">Name:  </p><p class="name">Joe Blow</p>
<p class="label email-label">Email:  </p><p
class="email">joeblow at example.com</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="person" id="person-2">
<td class="face">
<img class="pic">
</td>
<td class="info"
<p class="label name-label">Name:  </p><p class="name">Joe Blow2</p>
<p class="label email-label">Email:  </p><p
class="email">joeblow2 at example.com</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Message-ID: <4D5AB8B0.9010704@unFocus.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to use 'the_post_thumbnail' to output the full size image 
(the original size not resized by wordpress), but without outputting the 
width and height (I'd like them width="100%" height="" actually, but 
empty would be good enough).

Is there anyway to do that with this function, or will I have to build 
my image tag manually?

the_post_thumbnail() takes an optional second paramter which controls
the <img> tag attributes. Unfortunately the width and height
attributes are applied regardless of this parameter.

Therefore the only way to change the width and height attributes is to
 use the 'post_thumbnail_html' filter and do a preg_replace() on the
attributes.

There is a ticket on Trac for this, I'll update this thread when I find it.

You'd have to build it manually. WordPress always puts those there
because without them, you have to wait for the image to load before
the page will render, since the browser can't reserve the space for it
until it knows the size it will be.

I understand why it outputs the width and height, I just wanted to be 
able to override the default values, because I have a case where I don't 
want that behavior.

Yeah I tried that first. Hopefully it'll be changed/fixed in core?

That did it nicely!

<?php

$custom = get_post_meta($custom["_thumbnail_id"][0],

<img src="<?php $uploads = wp_upload_dir(); echo $uploads['baseurl'] .

Here's a bit of a hack workaround that works too... If you do this,
the width and height get left off entirely. You also get a weird
attachment class, but which won't break anything.

the_post_thumbnail(array(0.1,0.1));

No guarantees on whether it will continue to work in the future. :)

One other thing that is often useful when styling tables is a .alt class on
every second row (preferably also with .odd and .even on rows for people who
prefer that semantic construction).

Unless you have borders on your table cells, having a background color on
every second row has a huge positive effect on readability of the data.
Pre-emptively giving theme authors the chance to add that kind of style will
make it easier for them if they find bordered tables don't' look good in
their themes (I rarely find bordered tables look good anywhere)

.alt and .odd/.even are a common paradigm in the wp-admin aready already so
many people are used to them.

Also: +1 to the advice the others already gave you. Having periods in CSS
classes is crazy because you use the period so much in the CSS syntax
itself. Make each tr/td have both a generic class and a specific ID with a
number (which might be useful, for example, to style only the first row a
special way without depending on :first-child).

Widgets/sidebars is one of the failures of WPML, so having a good way of
fixing that is important. My thinking is that the easiest way would be to
duplicate all sidebars at the sidebar definition level, leaving the original
for the default language (often English), then within your plugin defining
clones of each  sidebar for the other relevant languages (i.e.
'call-to-action' and 'call-to-action-es')

IMHO that would be a lot simpler for both the code and the user to
understand than trying to have widget-by-widget translations. It wouldn't
require any custom UI to be built, you'd just have to call
register_sidebar() and figure out a way to filter the sidebar label when it
is called by dynamic_sidebar(). It's also very possible that one of the
sites doesn't want all the widgets from the other (e.g. there is an english
twitter promoted in a widget, but not spanish twitter so no need for that
widget in the ES version), so translating on a sidebar level gives finer
control over which widgets are present in which language.

Personally I think a lot of organizations would be better off with an MS
install that has the languages in different 'sites', with the plugin only
keeping track of the relationships between source posts on one site and
their translation on another. In that scenario disabling the plugin doesn't
lose any of the content, it remains available at the same URLs, only the
links between languages are lost until the plugin can be updated/replaced.

There is certainly room in WP for both types of plugins (multi-site and
single-site) but at the moment all the serious plugins use the single-site
approach, with the muiltisite approach only being used in closed systems
with custom plugins (Me and Frank for example). IMHO WP users are desperate
for a full-featured plugin like qTranslate or WPML but with the multi-site
approach. I use one on Global Voices but it is not at all the solution that
the general community needs (it doesn't use multisite, but instead links
together completely different installations) so I won't be writing this
fantasy plugin until I change a lot of other things about our setup first.

Good luck! Since WPML went commercial there is suddenly a great vacuum in WP
multilingualism that could be filled. Here's hoping the qTranslate guy also
does some good work in the near future and there is more competition than
ever :)

Not disagreeing, but CSS3 has nth-child built in. Works in all modern
browsers except IE (and possibly Opera).

http://www.quirksmode.org/css/nthchild.html

Example: tr:nth-child(odd) {style:here;}

hi Jeremy,

I like your idea for the widgets, I will trry it out.

About the Multi Site alternative, I was thought of it (and used it) as a
work around. Does this plugin you mention that saves relationships between
posts in the different subsites exists? If not, it seems quite easy to do,
but then I think its another plugin, not this one Im describing. I mean, I
dont think its possible to do both things with the same plugin.

Nice thing about using single site WordPress is that you can have a multi
site instalation and each blog can have multiple languages...

Subject: [wp-hackers] Clearing out bot users
Message-ID: <4D5AF642.6020800@unFocus.com>

Hey,

I'd like to clear out all those thousands of bot users. I came up with 
this SQL statement to list all the spam users:

SELECT * FROM wp_users AS u
JOIN wp_usermeta AS mv ON mv.user_id = u.ID
WHERE mv.meta_key = 'wp_capabilities' AND mv.meta_value LIKE '%subscriber%'
AND ( SELECT count(*) FROM wp_comments AS c WHERE c.user_id = u.ID ) <= 0
AND ( SELECT count(*) FROM wp_posts AS p WHERE p.post_author = u.ID ) <= 0

This could be converted into a delete statement to nuke any user that 
has no posts or comments and is a subscriber.

Did I miss anything?

Thanks,

Kevin N.

Make sure you delete their usermeta rows too.

Also, *BACKUP FIRST*. Obviously. :)

Converting that to a single Query that can delete all usermeta rows 
seems difficult for my shallow understanding of SQL.

I'll spend a few more than 5 minutes on that another time. :-)

The plugin I use is not available but there is a much simpler version that
shows the effect:

https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bilingual-linker/

AFAIK all it does is give you a postmeta field for 'other language' and
display the results on the post, but in many cases that is the only thing
you really need to turn two seperate sites into translations of each other.

What it's missing is things like tracking the original author of some
content separate from it's translator, and the ability to handle more than 2
languages with any kind of grace.

I agree that my multisite approach shouldn't necessarily be part of a plugin
designed for single-site, as a lot of the logic is totally seperate. I think
in theory you could have one plugin that did both, so it's possible, but
it's not really desirable to mix them together.

Ok so basically there isn't a better way.  Now I can make this easier by
caching the resulting array in say a site option, then most the time all I
have to do is pull a site option.  Then I just need to find the necessary
hooks pto update the data when it has or may have changed.  So I need to
find hooks for when role/capabilities are changed and a hook when a user
changes roles.  Does anyone know of any such hooks, am I missing any otherd
id need?

idk why $post isn't set, might be a bug but thee might be a reason too, so
you might want to confirm that with someone else.  But as long as $post_id
is set you can use that with get_post();

So you can to this

function do_backup ($post_id, $post) {
       if (!isset($post)) {
              $post = get_post(intval($post_id));
       }
       my_backup($post);
}

well you could use that query to select the user id's then use two delete
queries one for user table based off the id, one for user meta based off of
user id.  So exactly simple single query but it works.  Also if you intend
to use this in a plugin on not directly on the database you could use
wp_delete_user() which deletes the user and user meta for the user id, you
pass.

Thanks Ryan, I thought of that but $post_id isn't set either.  What's really driving me mad is that the function is being triggered but not I can't find a way to identify the post :)

idk what to say then, it probably is a bug, unless someone can confirm that
for some reason this is expected behavior.

You're going to have to include more information/code here..

What is that function hooked to to start with?

In 3.1 you can use get_users('role=subscriber') to avoid using any custom
SQL but like you say that is not usually good enough and capabilities are
fundamentally more useful and important in WP (especially in public plugins
where you can't make any assumptions about roles).

IMHO get_users() should be able to take in a capability as well as roles,
too bad that wasn't included in 3.1. It's certainly a complicated problem,
but it doesn't seem impossible, just potentially irresponsible WRT server
performance (you'd want to cache it if you use it on most pageloads).

Here's the actions I attach my own user caching system to:

function gv_hook_user_udpate($user_id, $old_user_data = '') {
     gv_update_cached_user($user_id);
}
add_action('profile_update', 'gv_hook_user_udpate', '', 2);
add_action('user_register', 'gv_hook_user_udpate', '', 1);

That seems to cover most scenarios, though there could easily be edge cases
that aren't covered, especially because often cap/role related changes are
made using plugins that probably don't call profile_update after changing a
user. Having this data reload at regular intervals is going to be important.

I'd recommend using the Transients API instead of options, as it will handle
expiration for you: https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API

I was also thinking I might need to have a hook that will fire when roles
and capabilities are changed, is there such a hook in the roles class that
gets fired?

Better yet, I am not going to map to WP capabilities, I can have the user
choose what wp users they want to do this in the options page and store that
directly in an array, simplest and cleanest way to get the job done as far
as i can tell.

The solution here is to move away from a schema where users are given
capabilities directly.

Currently dormant Trac ticket: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10201

While we're not sure when it'll be implemented, most of us are inclined to
implement the proposal outlined in detail here:
http://andrewnacin.com/2010/04/03/overhauling-roles-and-capabilities-part-2/

Interesting, but hakre's comment got me thinking...what if instead of doing
away with user specific capabilities, we did away with roles.  I mean since
when does it make sense to link a user to an arbitrary grouping (ie role)
that just links to the actual capabilities.  Best I can tell this was done
for simplicity, most average user's want to make a user an editor, not make
a user who has capabilities a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, x, y, and z if you know what I
mean.  That is all fine and good and I can understand that.  But who says
you have to link the user to a role.  Picture this, you add a new table
let's call it usercaps (yes, you could use usermeta for this but it'll
probably be cleaner to do this is a different table) that will link users to
caps, with an arbitrary auto incremented number to act as primary key, the
scheme would be like this:

| ID (pk) | User ID | Capability |
--------------------------------------
|     1     |      1       | manage_options

ect...this can be done either way, select * from usercaps where User ID = 1
and Capability = manage_options to see if the user has the cap, select
UserID from usercaps where Capability = manage_options to see who has
manage_options, or select Capability from usercaps where User ID = 1 to see
what caps user 1 has.

Now what about the general user, we want to keep simple things simple while
remaining flexible is the key, you we will still have something called
roles, it will be much like a template of capabilities to give the user, the
net effect cleanner in the db, keeps the simple role system for the general
user, but it's flexible for those power users.

Now for the power users, there would be an API that a plugin could utilize
to replace the role selector with a direct capability selector so now each
user can have their own distinct set of capabilities, if needed.  This would
be done via Plugin API with a plugin only for those requiring something more
flexible than just the basic roles.

This way you change out your old V6 roles/capabilities engine with a more
powerful v8, while keeping things simple for the average user but remaining
flexible for advanced users giving them more power if they need it (hey
that's a good analogy, I'll have to remember that one, lol).

So the big question...any feedback, suggestions, complaints, death threats
about this? I am interested in hearing what you all have to say.

but if you would want to add a capability to a role, you don't know 
which user has which role.
so you would have to do this for every user.

Jeremy,

Just to tell you that I have just finished the part of the plugin that
handles with all the options.. It works great. I dont have to register the
sidebars again, but the behavior ends up the same, I have completely
independent sidebars...

Now Im going to solve how to translate taxonomies...

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_nav_menu() Returns Blank on Static Homepage
Message-ID: <AANLkTimGdxDDY_kAzhb6it_JBGqw5fzX=H4OM9LhSph4@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I've been developing a theme locally with the beta build
3.1-RC4-17441. I then go to move it online, and I update my online
install so I can be using RC4 on that as well. However, that build is
now on 3.1-RC4-17453. Now somewhere between those 12 updates, a bug
with wp_nav_menu() has occurred (I'm fairly sure).

On the earlier release I have no problems creating a static front page
and displaying the navigation menus. However, on the live version
(3.1-RC4-17453), they always appear blank (even on pages other than
the homepage.) I know it's not the theme because the same issue occurs
on Twenty Ten as well. All plugins are also deactivated.

The navigation menu's won't show custom links, pages, posts, or
taxonomies. The container DIV is created, and the UL as well, but no
list items appear. As soon as I switch it to display latest posts on
the homepage, the menu items appear.

Any ideas? I took a quick glance through the Trac change sets but
didn't see anything that should have affected it (I'm far from an
expert though).

Thanks,
Spencer

This was probably related to
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16545 . As of r17456 this should
be fixed. Can you update and test?

John

PS The wp-testers list is more appropriate for stuff relating to
testing betas and trunk.

Yep -- get_posts() was briefly broken due to the wrong variable being used.

Should be fixed in tonight's nightly. The current revision is 17456, if you
wish to svn up for the fix.

Thanks for the great links (and for writing the post to summarize the ticket
which may be dormant because it is so messy and in need of rephrasing based
on a specific chosen solution).

I think keeping the ability to have multiple roles per user is important if
you kill the custom capabilities. It avoids completely murdering all the
use-cases covered by multi-caps and based on the trac ticket it should be
doable within the better code-ideas for the overhaul.

More thoughts in my reply to the ticket:
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10201#comment:60

Working on the changes outlined in the ticket alongside adding a capability
argument to get_users() would solve a lot of problems at once :)

I'd thought of using a simple php loop and the WP functions, but it was 
more fun to try and come up with a single SQL query that could do it. :-)

Which would be less likely to break?

$custom = get_post_meta($custom["_thumbnail_id"][0], 
'_wp_attached_file',true);

or

the_post_thumbnail(array(0.1,0.1));

It'd be nice if I could just override (or remove with NULL) width and 
height manually in the attr array..

Building it yourself by getting the meta is less likely to break in the future.

Iif you are doing that chances are you would probably just use a plugin that
will let you manage capabilities directly though it can be possible perhaps
for a plugin to introduce its own custom caps or for a new core cap.

There are really two options, option one is you could determain the current
role by caps, ie if they can manage_options you know they are an admin, if
not check a cap first avalible at the next level, or introduce a role
specific cap (bring back levels for instance).

The other thing is to still store the role in user meta, this way you can
still display in the admin panel the specific role for a given user like
today.

The method least likely to break would be using the attachment
functions rather than meta fields directly. From within the loop:

$thumb = wp_get_attachment_image_src( get_post_thumbnail_id(), $size );

$thumb will then be an array of elements the source, width, and height
respectively. To output the src you'd just use:

echo $thumb[0];

I'm looking around in the admin panel and can't seem to find the switch 
that turns off the new admin bar as seen in WP 3.1. Am I missing 
something? Or is this gonna be yet another feature that requires me to 
install a plugin to get rid of?

Add add_action( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' ); to your  
functions.php file.

Just wanted to say thanks.

Thank you so much for calling the API functions surrounding the "links" 
feature "bookmarks" so that it's impossible to find it in the Codex! ;-)

For future reference, if you want to get a list of links (er, bookmarks) 
by category, it's:

$archives = get_bookmarks(array('category_name' => 'your category name'));

Thanks.

I was looking for a way to disable it globally initially, but also
allow users to enable it if they want it.

Also, if I add that snippet to my functions.php file, users still see
the option to toggle it in their personal options. So, this sets up a
weird situation where we've disabled it globally, and users see an
option to enable it in either the front or backend, yet it does
nothing.

Am I missing something obvious -- ie. a way to disable it and also
remove those options from the user's profile?

Thanks-
Bill

I use this to get rid of the profile options and disable the admin bar.  
You can add this to the functions.php or if you switch themes, just turn 
it into a plug in.

/* Disable the Admin Bar. */
add_filter( 'show_admin_bar', '__return_false' );

/* Remove the Admin Bar preference in user profile */
remove_action( 'personal_options', '_admin_bar_preferences' );

Thank you. This is not working for me in  3.1-RC4-17462. (adding the
remove_action does nothing). I'll assume this is because I'm using a
bleeding edge nightly! :)

Why don't you use a hook so that when a user is created you turn it off for
them, then if they want it they go to their profile and turn it on.

Thank you. This is not working for me in  3.1-RC4-17462. (adding the
remove_action does nothing). I'll assume this is because I'm using a

because that was reverted, so it hasn't done anything for 6weeks.

It'll have to be hidden via JS/CSS for 3.1:

In the devs read this list, having the admin bar on by default might 
result in a megaton of phone calls to Web devs whose customers will 
invariable ask what it is, why it's on their site and do their visitors 
see it too, and how to turn off.

It might be more economical for all WP users if there's a simple 
one-time message in the dashboard that the feature exists and can be 
turned on. I'm thinking how many calls I'm gonna get from people about 
this, and all added up, I'll spend a cumulative few days of time on the 
phone answering the same 2 questions over and over.

I'm have nightmarish flashbacks to my days as Microsoft Windows 
networking engineer...

DELETE u, mv
FROM wp_users AS u
JOIN wp_usermeta AS mv ON mv.user_id = u.ID
WHERE mv.meta_key = 'wp_capabilities' AND mv.meta_value LIKE '%subscriber%'
AND ( SELECT count(*) FROM wp_comments AS c WHERE c.user_id = u.ID ) <= 0

Thats great, but how do you get the list of categories used in the 
"links" features first ?

Ideally what I would like is a page for each link category with the 
links for just that category on it.

Couldn't you simply send a preemptive email to all of your clients, letting
them know what it is, not to be scared, what the benefits are, how to turn
it off, etc.? It's a little late (way too late) in the release cycle to be
asking for changes.

No. I can't do that for everyone. After 7+ years of rolling out WP sites 
I do not have a complete list of contact information for everyone that 
is likely to call me anymore because that sort of data invariably 
changes. And of course I'm not alone, that holds true for other many 
other devs as well.

As for release cycles, it's never to early to think of the implications 
when writing code.

Seems to me that the people who develop new features for WP ought to be 
able to place themselves into broader abstract scenarios and then 
extrapolate what the best course of action would be, given the potential 
impact of a new feature. Apparently that didn't happen in this case. Or 
hasn't yet anyway.

That feature can be changed to 'off by default' and a simple one-time 
admin message can added in about 15 minutes flat. That simple act would 
save countless hours of time for everyone else.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm having nightmarish flashbacks to my days as 
a Microsoft Windows network engineer. In case that doesn't make sense as 
is, I will clarify: MS is notorious for doing what they want to do 
without fully taking into consideration the vast implications of such 
new features. Invariably their new features create situations that 
result in the severe overload of help desks around the world, which of 
course equates to time and money - e.g. loss of revenue.

Please don't. This was discussed ad nauseum already. It was decided to
have it on by default. The first versions didn't even have options to
turn it off at all.

It's on by default and that's that.

That's not going to fix the underlying problem that created the 
secondary problem.

I just submitted a patch for that... I suspect it will fall on deaf ears.

Wouldn't that only delete 1 row in wp_users and 1 row in wp_usermeta? 
There would be multiple rows in wp_usermeta to delete.

No, what it amounts to is that it's too late in the cycle to be
requesting changes like this. The admin bar has been worked on for
several months now. If you wanted input on it being off by default,
you should have said so at least 3 months ago.

This is last thing I'll say on the topic since this isn't the place to 
discuss it: What is lacking in the dev team is a certain kind of 
thinking capacity. That's not a complaint. It's objective observation 
that ought to be taken as constructive criticism.

For the record, I disagree with you and think it should be on by
default. This isn't a lack in my "thinking capacity", this is just me
flat out disagreeing with you.

I'm sorry that you think that is going to cause you headaches with
clients. I'm thinking more about having the admin bar appear to all
users, everywhere. If you having to tell people how to turn it off is
a problem, well, too bad. That's your problem with your customers that
you will have to deal with. I think it is more important to have the
feature active and visible than to avoid your minor customer service
problems.

Features that are off by default are rarely turned on. I saw somewhere
that new features which default to off get used less than 5% of the
time (Firefox, maybe? Not sure there). Whereas features that default
to on get something like 90% of people not bothering to turn it off.

Heck, even people who have used WordPress for quite a long time don't
know about the "Screen Options" or "Help" dropdowns on the admin
screens. They're too hidden. Things should be up front and visible if
you want them to get used.

You don't like the admin bar. I get that. But I like it and I think
most people will like it. Therefore it's on and it should be on and it
should default to on and that's just the way I see it.

I realize the decision was made some time ago, and arguing against it is
pointless (which is why I haven't).

I think there is merit, though, in the suggestion that the feature be turned
ON by default for NEW installations, and turned OFF by default for upgrades.
As a matter of principle, upgrades should not be changing users' already
established configurations - even if the change comes from a new feature.

But, that is all water under the bridge at this point. If I choose not to
use the Admin Bar, I know how to disable it.

This is true of any new feature or design change. The whole point of 
someone hiring a consultant or firm to help them with their WordPress 
site is to have the comfort of there being someone to hold their hand 
when things change. The same argument was had here when we redesigned 
the admin in 2.7.

"Oh, no, my clients won't know what to do now!"
"If that's the case, then do your job and help them!"

  Anyone with WP site clients is providing the service of getting them 
through version/feature/workflow transitions easily. If you have a lot 
of clients, then yes, answering the same question over and over would 
probably drive you mad. This is simple enough to prevent. Write up a 
guide to new features for 3.1 (there are plenty on the web you can use 
as reference) and send it to all your clients. Or, answer the phone 
calls and bill them for your time.

If it happened like that most people would either never find out about new
features, complain it wasn't enabled by default or claim their is a bug
because it wasn't enabled.

I don't believe that *most* users would do any such thing.

I believe that *most* users, when they learn about a new feature due to that
new feature changing something about the appearance or output of their site,
are going to be quite unhappy that said new feature was enabled - and thus,
changed their site - without permission.

New features that change the public-facing appearance or output of users'
sites should not be enabled by default.

But, again: this argument was had months ago, and those who espouse my
opinion lost that argument. There's really not much sense in re-hashing it
now.

IMHO everyone ignores the yellow update bar anyway unless I specifically
tell them to click it :)

Chris is right that most people don't update (in my experience) usually they
are too afraid to because they don't know what it means or what will happen.

Also I think Chip is correct that people don't like change.  Look at
Facebook they force change on their users UI and everyone hates it (at
first) then they get used to it.

Change scares people.  All of this can be equated to fear.

People get emotionally attached to their opinions an as such no amount

It's being tested.  How about instead of rehashing old debates without any
new information, we all svn up and test so that it can get out the door?

Aaron, your email identifies part of the overall problem in the community.

From what I gather there are two groups of developers in WordPress these days. There are those who are close to Automattic and make decisions (Jane published a list of them) and those who are far enough outside the inner circle to not know about these features until it's too late.

I think both sides have a point. 

WP is a commercial product for Automattic so they need to do what they need to do. On the other hand, the core of WP is open source, some of the recent features might be a little too brand focussed for people who don't share an interest in Automattic.

If a develop doesn't like what the core team is doing, they're free to change it. I'm just glad we have the hooks to do it.

Christopher,

1) This feature was announced September 3rd -
https://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/process-and-scope-for-3-1-part-i/,
and the first patch related to this landed on 2010-09-27 -
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/15671 .  Not knowing until it's too
late?  Are you having a laugh or just not paying attention?

2) WordPress is not a commercial product for Automattic.  WordPress is an
open source product that I am proud to contribute too.  You may want to
check your facts.

3)  If you don't like what the core team is doing, contribute to core so
that you have a say.

-Aaron

As someone who isn't close to Automattic but a fairly large user of WP, I can say I honestly haven't been shocked by any of the new features. I wouldn't say WP is being built to Automattic's needs - wp.com has had the bar for a while, and in fact I know wp.com goes far above and beyond the standard wp install. If you're a WP consultant, you do need to follow trac and test all of prereleases - that's you're responsibility. If you don't like a feature, bring it up in alpha, not in RC5. If you don't complain before feature freeze because you don't test before feature freeze that's not exactly the core team's problem. 

PS would like to reiterate that, while much of the core team works for Automattic, not all of them do. If you really set your mind to it, I'm sure you too could become part of the inner circle.

Exactly. Anyone whose business is built on or even remotely near 
WordPress should at the very least be subscribed to 
http://wpdevel.wordpress.com so that even if you don't get involved in 
the scheduled (and open) core development chats, you at least know 
what's going on before it is too late to have an effect (or at least too 
late to have a positive effect).

Of course, simply answering his question would have taken far less time, and
would have been far less condescending.

Seriously, have you considered the above approach? Sounds like you are
building yourself a house of cards for no reason. You should get them to
fill out their bio and use their public profile screens instead of the
custom post type. Why isn't this acceptable?

The only real issue is that there's no TinyMCE in the About Me section of
the user profile screen. Maybe that's a dealbreaker but if you used the
other fields intelligently you could make up for it by showing their
avatars/URLs/twitter accounts etc. automatically on their profiles, removing
the need for links/images inside the biographical content. Adding new fields
to the profile screen is pretty easy, especially if the data could fall
under 'contact methods', which you can add to basically for free (
http://is.gd/GIRQT4)

As a bonus this method would promote a consistent style for all profiles
(which you can design not each individual user) and help people get all the
most important information onto their profiles without messing around with
the content of a post for hours.

You'd also want to change the permalink path for authors, but like modifying
the profile form it's trivial compared to the other ideas in this thread.

I know that Aaron Jorbin already responded to this, but I want to make 
sure that it's clear this isn't a single person's point of view.  First, 
you *can* help decide what happens in WordPress by joining the developer 
chats and participating on TRAC.  If you don't take the time to do these 
things then you shouldn't be disappointed when you're unspoken words 
weren't heard.

That's not to say that there isn't a core group that has more 
influence.  However, it's not Automattic that's the core group and it's 
not a dictatorship.  They have simply earned a reputation and thus they 
have more pull.  It's not a closed group, and if you want you could be a 
part of it some day if you participate enough and show that you have the 
necessary skills and discretion.

Additionally, WordPress is definitely NOT an Automattic product.  It is 
completely open source and community driven.  Personally I've never 
written a line of code for Automattic, but have plenty of patches in 
WordPress.

As was said before, if you don't like a particular feature, the best 
time to bring it up is while the feature is still an idea not after it's 
gone through alpha, beta, and several RCs.

I'm sure he greatly appreciates your efforts to introduce him to the
heretofore-unknown tool known as "Google" - and doing so in a way that
emulates any great fisherman, who are known always to comment on their
students landing their first catch with, "Was that really so hard?"

Will, I agree completely. If you want to contribute, get in there and help. I've had nothing but positive experiences anytime I've contributed.  However, what (and this was my point) people need to remember is that at the end of the day, it is Matt's project and Automattic is how he funds it. It's why the platform is as good as it is and it'll just keep getting better because of it.

Automattic is a comercial venture. That can't be dismissed. They charge $250,000 a year to support clients. The difference between them and an average consultant is that they turn a lot (but not all) of that money back inwards to WordPress development for the community. I think this is great, but I also think it's easy to see however why some people think an open source project should not be centrally focussed around a single company or so closely moderated by the employees of a commercial venture. I disagree with them but I can see their argument. 

Is WP too commercial? Is it becoming Microsoft? Will camel casing kill us all in our sleep or is the new admin bar the devil's work? There's an easy solution if you think so, either contribute and put up with a project leader that you sometimes disagree with or change platforms to one that listens to you.

I wouldn't say WP is being built to Automattic's needs - wp.com has had the bar for a while, and in fact I know wp.com goes far above and beyond the standard wp install. If you're a WP consultant, you do need to follow trac and test all of prereleases - that's you're responsibility. If you don't like a feature, bring it up in alpha, not in RC5. If you don't complain before feature freeze because you don't test before feature freeze that's not exactly the core team's problem.

In general, if you like an open-source project but not the way it is
run, forking it is also an option.

I think ace coder slingers are acutely aware of how long it'd take to 
tweak this feature to be off by default for existing installs... So 
insinuating that it's too late for change before 3.1 releases is not 
based in any actually tweak time time considerations.

Treat him like an idiot while you are doing it and he'll punch you in 
the face and steal your pole.

;)

IMHO, businesses need to consider involvement in WordPress core 
development a business imperative and one worthy of investment. If their 
business is affected (and effected) by the features included in a 
release, there is an obvious benefit to having their staff involved 
early in the development cycle.  They need to have involvement beyond 
just deployment testing for their installs.

This isn't about the length of time it would take for someone to do what 
you think should be done, it's about sticking with project release protocol.

Once a release reaches RC status, it is too late to do this. RC = bug 
fixes, not tweaks, and this isn't a bug.

While I understand that you aren't happy about it being on by default, 
it is way past time to do anything about it for 3.1.

There have been plenty of suggestions in this thread on how to disable 
it for your clients' installs, so you can pick which one would be the 
easiest for you to implement.

So, rather than arguing the merits of on/off, perhaps you should be 
looking at notifying your clients of what's coming and gather their 
feedback on whether they want it or not.

Peace out.

Kim

Absolutely true!  This isn't at all about the time it takes to do the 
coding.  As Otto said 32 messages earlier in this thread, the issue is 
the need to adhere to the development cycle and release management.  
Jealously protecting the quality of a release, in the days before it 
goes out, is one of the hardest things to face as a software engineer.  
Lack of process is part of why many open source projects wither on the 
vine. I think WordPress's ongoing struggle to impose a release cycle and 
and adhere to these processes is one of the reasons for its success.

Ya, because doing that requires a hellacious amount of mental gymnastics 
to justify those decisions.

I can see it now, I spend 2 or 3 months developing a full blown high-end 
auction site (or whatever it might be) based on WP for a high paying 
customer, due to launch sometime soon (3 days, 7 days, who knows). The 
customer calls me up and says "Looks great. Everything works fine. But, 
I want you to tweak that menu before we launch" - to which I reply, 
"Sorry bro, WP philosophy dictates that I cannot do that as we're too 
close to launch. I told you 2 weeks ago we were entering RC versions. 
But don't worry, I'll fix you up in a point release some time after we 
launch."

Rrrrrright. Guess what the customer is gonna say?

Lol. Some things happen the way they do not because of time constraints, 
but because people are attached to certain philosophies that have no 
basis in what is or isn't reasonably possible.

I think you're being a bit silly.

First, you're not the only WordPress 'client' ? the platform isn't  
being built just for you. In addition, WordPress is open-source ? if  
you want to add (or remove) a feature, you can write a plugin or  
(gasp) modify core.

At some point, WordPress has to enter feature freeze. Every change has  
the potential to introduce a bug (3.0.5 showed us that). So, again, to  
reiterate, these sorts of decisions need to be made earlier in the dev  
cycle. Where do you draw the line about what changes are too big? By  
saying any feature request is too big.

You're welcome to your perspective of course. What you're not getting is 
my overall point at this stage in the discussion: The reasons cited for 
not being able to make the change (nevermind whether anyone wants to 
change it or not) are entirely bogus. All that needs to be said, in

Simple as that.

We aren't going to change anything because we don't want to.

We had this discussion, in numerous public forums, months ago, and at that
point, reached a decision then. Beyond that, we're just beating a dead horse
here.

"We aren't going to change this particular thing because we agreed on a 
project plan that identified a feature freeze date many months ago, and 
the freeze date was agreed upon by all contributing developers in the 
weekly public dev chat as well as posted on the dev blog. Debates and 
discussions about how the feature shoudl work occurred before the freeze 
date."

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=VCAUt2m6eLZjLgF=aQw=beHukqto3opcBuqWY@mail.gmail.com>

Oh great WordPress guru's I need some help.

I'm writing a plugin that will allow a user to add an event (oy, more event
plugins) and schedule a reminder email for it.I have 2 problems.

1) Sometimes it seems that despite passing in the correct timestamp, the
reminder is set to Jan 1, 1970. I've stepped through in a debugger and a
valid timestamp is passed to wp_schedule_single_event.

2) When adding multiple single reminders (1 hour before, 2 hours before, 1
day before), often only 1 of the reminders is registered. Again, valid
timestamps, more than 10 minutes apart etc.

Can anyone suggest why this might happen?

I'm running on a local XAMPP install and it "could" be a timing issue.
WordPress 3.0.5 install.

It's not a common "Open Source" mentality, but yeah, lots of large 
corporations would expect nothing less.

You certainly can be flexible on a site that is being developed for an 
individual. When you are doing that site for your high paying customer, 
it is entirely appropriate to tell the customer "At this point, we need 
to only make bug fixes and high priority changes so that we don't 
accidentally break anything.  If this is a game stopper, of course we'll 
put it in, but otherwise let's add it to the list of changes that we 
want to make after the release".  You and the customer will decide how 
that is handled, not "WP Philosophy" or whatever that is.

Obviously.

If anything of value could be gleaned from this thread, one such nugget 
might be that once in a while it'd be very helpful for devs to post a 
simple short ping here about version releases and the need to take part 
in dev chats if one wants to. Thing is, a lot of people get super busy 
and loose track of dev cycles since they aren't involved in writing core 
code or patches, and a lot of people show up here who aren't aware that 
such other lists and IRC events exist.

I was always under the impression that the Release Candidates were when 
testers can give feedback towards functionality which at that point their 
opinions can be heard.

Many developers would be well-served by giving a few hours to core each
week. You'd be much more informed when it comes to the codebase and you'd be
on the cutting edge of WordPress development.

I'm working on a handbook for contributing to WordPress core, to replace our
older Codex pages and other manuals. I'll be sure to send it to wp-hackers
when done and I really hope to see a lot of you on Trac.

No -- release candidates mean that we think we're done and that WordPress
will be released if no blocking issues are discovered.

Beta versions are when you can provide feedback. Ideally, this is when
initial testing should occur, not during the RC phase. But functionality
isn't going to be changed much even once we hit beta. Beta comes a few weeks
after feature freeze. If you want to give feedback toward functionality,
it'll have to be earlier in the cycle.

That would be very unusual.  That's what betas are for.  WordPress 3.1 
beta 1 came out Nov 25, 2010.  That's when testers, consultants and 
industry people be highly involved and really double down to provide 
feedback on the features as they were implementated.

You might be confusing RC (Release Candidate) with RFC (Request for
Comments). Release Candidate means (or should mean) "this is our final
release, unless you find critical bugs in it."

The time for developer feedback about features is early on, during
feature discussions and development, or maybe during beta for small
tweaks.

Hey Jeff..

did you check your timezone and timestamp.If not then please check it..Its
as..

=> Dashboard => Options => General Options

This is where you can change your time stamp so it reflects the time zone
you live in. Click "Update Options" to save the change.

WordPress gets its time from the webserver that it is running on, which may
not be the same as the MySQL server.

In PHP, have them run this to see what the server time is:
<?php echo gmdate('Y-m-d G:i:s'); ?>

That should output the current time on the server in GMT, which is what the
time on their server should be set to.

WordPress uses that time plus whatever offset you give it to determine your
"local" time.

Warm Regards
Aditya Sharma

You can use* current_time('mysql',get_option('gmt_offset'))*  for getting
time according to your blog.

The other main reason to use post_types though would be the media. For
instance if your "users" are artists and need to upload samples of
their work, there's no way to do this in the user interface.

Message-ID: <4D5EC0BB.4040409@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Can someone tell me how to use the function get_categories and use it 
with get_posts to make a page that has categories and nested sub 
categories and there posts all neatly wrapped in a ul/li/ul/li/ul/li as 
required.

Have tried to do it myself but unfortunately not getting anywhere fast.

Thanks in advance.

This isn't a direct answer to your question but my advice is to set up
something that logs to a file when your wp-cron-attached function runs. I've
found that's the only really safe way to know WTF wp-cron is actually doing.

It's possible your local server isn't happy about email or something, but if
the first thing your script does is add a line to a debug file then you can
track what hook fired, when it fired and you can debug whether there is an
unrelated email or other error causing the failure.

In terms of the single events, are you sure you're using unique
slugs/labels? I'm pretty sure you can overwrite a cron event by rescheduling
the same name to a new time.

Also this is something you probably already know but the wp-cron system only
fires when someone visits the site. So without organic traffic (local
install where it's just you) it will only fire when you load the site
yourself. If you schedule three events one per hour and come back in three
hours they will all fire simultaneously, resulting in a different effect
than what you expected. The result is that it will not behave like in the
wild and you need to lower the timeframes involved when testing to avoid
driving yourself nuts. Here's some simple code to add an 'Every Minute'
timeframe to use when testing:

/**
 * Add filter on cron_schedules hook to insert custom scheduling times
 *
 * @see wp_get_schedules() which calls the filter and defines default
periods.
 *
 * @param array $empty_array Empty array passed in by wp_get_schedules()
 * @return array Filtered array including our custom scheduling periods
 */
function gv_filter_cron_schedules($empty_array) {
    $new_schedules = array(
        'every_minute' => array(
            'interval' => 60,
            'display' => __('Every Minute'),
        )
    );

    return array_merge($empty_array, $new_schedules);;
}
add_filter('cron_schedules', 'gv_filter_cron_schedules');

Excellent point. You might also take advantage of taxonomies to sort users,
which would only work with a CPT.

If letting them create seriously rich-media portfolios is an important part
of the utility of the site then the core user profiles might not be enough.
I still think it's worth considering profiles for their simplicity though.
You could always offer a 'Portfolio URL' contact option, and letting them go
wild with embedded images might not be desirable in the first place if you
want the various profiles to have a similar look.

OK, sorry I keep jumping back and forth on this.

So, using a slightly modified version of the code from stackexchange,
I've verified that all instances of the ID are being converted to the
slug by dumping $wp_query, but when I try to search within a custom
taxonomy it doesn't seem to filter the results. Is it possible to do
this?

Most of the time, the function inserts into the wp_cron, but sometimes it
just doesn't, even though a debug running shows the correct values being
passed 100% of the time. Sometimes the job is missing entirely and others it
sets to Jan 1, 1970 (or whatever the beginning of the epoch is).

I've ensured that all cron's would be scheduled for the future (2-3 days
out) and more than 10 minutes apart, so the obvious stuff seems correct.

Thanks for the reply Jeremy, but I haven't even gotten to the part of seeing
the cron / function fire. I'm just adding events to the cron. I do
understand how WP_cron fires at it's first call _AFTER_ the time specified
and plays catch up.

I've got a situation where a user creates a booking/event at say 10:00am on
Tuesday and can choose one or more from One hour, Two hour, one day, 2 days
prior for an email alert. So the jobs should be far enough apart to not
interfere. My function name is unique, and it seems that any single event
can work, but when adding more than one, it's spotty if they get entered.

I like your suggestion of logging to a file, but using NetBeans to step
through code, I can watch it fire. I have not yet traced the execution
through WP_cron to see where my details get lost. Guess that's next.

Without actually seeing your code, there's probably no way anybody can
answer your question.

The most likely cause is that you have a bug in your code somehow. If
you're getting cron jobs scheduled for 1970, then you're probably
passing a zero in as the first parameter to wp_schedule_single_event.
The scheduling functions aren't particularly complex. All they're
doing is to modify the cron array.

Now, your events not being scheduled may be understandable if they are
totally identical (matching hook+args). wp_schedule_single_event does
look for an identical event scheduled to happen within 10 minutes
after the time you're passing it, and prevents the new scheduling.
This is not obvious at first.

Say I schedule an event for 2 pm. I now am unable to schedule that
same event for any time after 1:50 pm, because the 2 pm event exists.
If I try, wp_schedule_single_event will simply return without
scheduling the event.

This has implications that most people might not realize.. Because if
I schedule an event for 1970 (zero), I'm now unable to schedule the
identical event for any time after 1970... If your events are wholly
identical, then you will have trouble scheduling more than one of them
unless your timing is tricky. In such cases, you should use a periodic
event using wp_schedule_event instead.

This makes me think of another idea: If you are scheduling multiple similar
events it might work better to only schedule the earlier one at first, then
add the later events during your hooked function on the first one. I don't
have experience with the complicated situation Otto is talking about, but it
sounds like only scheduling one event at a time might be a workaround that
isn't *too* hacky. It would also protect you from other types of bug since
you could make sure the latter event is still valid before scheduling it
when the first one fires.

Or change the arguments.

Events fire action hooks with arguments. Both the hook name and the
arguments make up the specific details of the event. Realistically,
you shouldn't be making identical events anyway.

Example:
If you need to fire off a function to, say, add a post, then the
function should take the post detail as inputs.


add_action('my_event_action','post_something',10,1);
function post_something($post) {
// do something with $post
}

function schedule_the_event() {
 $when = time();
 $post['title'] = 'whatever';
 $post['content'] = 'something';
 wp_schedule_single_event ( $when, 'my_event_action', $post );
}

If the args array is different for each event ($post in this case),
then you don't have have the 10 minute limitation either. So put your
changing data into that.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Rewrite
Message-ID: <AANLkTin1kecQREBm0in8fddA1QdC53g7rbyLeckFEyhi@mail.gmail.com>

I've also asked this over on the WordPress Stack Exchange ... let's see who
answers first :-)

I'm trying to create a custom API endpoint in WordPress, and I need to
redirect requests to a virtual page in the root of WordPress to an actual
page that ships with my plug-in. So basically, all requests to the one page
are actually routed to the other.

Example:
http://mysite.com/my-api.php =>
http://mysite.com/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin/my-api.php

The point of this is to make the url for the API endpoint as short as
possible (similar tohttp://mysite.com/xmlrpc.php but to ship the actual API
endpoint file with the plug-in rather than requiring the user to move files
around in their installation and/or hack core.

My first stab was to add a custom rewrite rule. However, this had two
problems.

   1. The endpoint always had a trailing slash. It became
   http://mysite.com/my-api.php/
   2. My rewrite rule was only ever partially applied. It wouldn't redirect
   to wp-content/plugins..., it would redirect to
   index.php&wp-content/plugins.... This lead to WordPress displaying either
   a page not found error or just defaulting to the homepage.

Ideas? Suggestions?

You could start by ditching the .php extension and use something like 
http://whateversiteyouhave.com/myapi/?parm1=this&parm2=that -- or similar.

Actually if you're going to use WP Rewrite, then you're loading WP, in 
which case you don't really need to bother for a simple API endpoint. 
Just use the site url itself and pass in some parms 
(thisorthat.com/?parm=val) , then have your plugin hook in during init 
to test for them.

That's one approach.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinWBonCWaqY3P6ANh2PTLsjwFPeRFqU4NghWT8H@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
is there a way to do it? Almost all plugins add a bunch of css,
jquery, JS, php, ajax, meta tags all over the places in the code, even
if you need a plugin only on one single post or page. This slows down
performance and dirties the code quite a lot. Is there a way to force
a plugin, use a simple "if" statement, to detect where it is
absolutely needed and only output code on that page? I see that some
plugin developers do it, could this be implemente in the core? Thanks

The practice you're referring to, where only a few developers use the
appropriate functions and hooks, is a result of *bad code*.  WordPress has
all the hooks in place for developers to add their scripts and styles only
where they should (rather than on every page load), but a lot of us are lazy
and don't do things the right way the first time, much to the detriment of
our users' site performance.

The easiest way to hook scripts or styles to a specific page is with
`is_page()`:

if( is_page('x')) { ?>
// YOUR SCRIPT STUFF
<?php }

You can do the same for `is_home()` and `is_frontpage()` and `is_single()`
etc.

The problem is that you can't dictate coding practices in core.  We expose
all the hooks, filters, etc necessary for developers to use clean code and
build quality systems, but there's no way to force them to.

It's written in many places what a plugin SHOULD look like and where and how it should enqueue scripts or css or output stuff. In the end it's in the plugin developer's responsibility to make sure that his/her plugin causes as little trouble as possible. I don't think that this enforcement could be implemented in core. How should WordPress know when a plugin is supposed to be used?

A way to make this situation better would be that YOU as the user tell the plugin author to fix it, or fix it on your own and share the patch with the plugin author. The other solution would be not to use that plugin.

I have a client (an Ethiopian in exile) who has created a very popular static site comprised of 6,000 (!) pages... all hand-created in Notepad (yes, the wheels turn differently in some parts of the world). Amazing, I know. 

I'm building a Wordpress site for him, but the question is how to get all that old static content into the site. Fortunately he's based all the old articles on the same original file, so the document structure is highly regular.  In Python/Django I'd write a BeautifulSoup script to crawl the directory, scrape content into objects, and pump it in through the Django API. I'm sure similar solutions exist for PHP/WordPress but don't know where to start. Has anyone done a project like this? Do you have a skeleton script to share, or pointers on best way to proceed?

Scot, this sounds like a perfect use of the wp_insert_post() function


	$post = array(
	  'comment_status' => 'closed',
	  'ping_status' => 'closed',
	  'post_author' => $authorID,
	  'post_category' => $cat,
	  'post_content' => mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['post_content']),
	  'post_excerpt' => mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['post_excerpt']),
	  'post_status' => $blogpoststatus,
	  'post_title' => $posttitle,
	  'post_type' => 'post',
	  'tags_input' =>  $_POST['post_tags']
	);
	$wpid = wp_insert_post($post);


I did a government site a while back with similar restrictions, after downloading the content to a directory using an offline viewer I simply ran RegEx on the content until I had 50,000 usable documents. After that, I simply ran a PHP script to pull in 100 pages at time, post to the WP database and move those files.

I agree with Paul and Aaron here.  SimpleHTMLDOM is VERY slick.  I've 
used it for similar purposes.  I can't remember which site at the 
moment, but the tool was so great to work with that I just had to speak 
up and give my endorsement too.

I've had good luck with that, and phpQuery.

http://code.google.com/p/phpquery/
phpQuery?is a server-side, chainable, CSS3 selector driven Document
Object Model (DOM) API?based on?jQuery JavaScript Library

In our case, we first build a sitemap of the pages we wanted to
import. It's basically a hierarchy built as an mult-level, unordered
list. This allows us to maintain parent-child relationships between
pages when they are imported into WordPress. We loop over that
unordered list of links, scrape each page, and use phpQuery to select
different parts of the page based on jQuery selectors. We can also add
custom fields to these imported page using add_post_meta.

I wrote a simple plugin called Instant-Content-plugin
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/instant-content-plugin to import
static files into posts. It uses text files, but you can play with the
code to get that the way you want, commenting out the code that
replaces crlf with br tags. I made it so it can import data from a zip
file of static pages, using the first line of each file as a title.

I've used this to import large amounts of static data into WP. Most
recently I have been using it to import pages from my older sites into
WP. I had several sites with hundreds of pages of content that just
grew over the years. Each page had a slightly different layout. I
loaded all the pages into Notebook++ and made global changes until I
got just bare content. I then zipped up the files and loaded them into
WP pages using the instant-content plugin.

Now that 3.1 is out, there are two things I'd like to address:

1) All of the core devs deserve a vacation.  Seriously.  Take a day or two
off and don't look at a computer.
2) Is there any chance we can get some documentation for the WordPress.org
API?  I'd like to poke at it a bit for plug-in stats, but without knowing
what parameters to send and what will be received, my only option would be
to hack away and guess.  I'd rather not take that route, since I'm sure *
someone* knows how the API works.  But a generic GET of
http://api.wordpress.org returns "Documentation coming soon" with no ETA
(it's been this way for a couple of years now, actually).  Can we revisit
this during the 3.2 cycle?

Eric, I'm sure they'll take you up on that and take at least an hour or two off :)

 I use these API calls a lot to check versioning:

http://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/crossslide-jquery-plugin-for-wordpress.xml
http://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/crossslide-jquery-plugin-for-wordpress.json
http://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/crossslide-jquery-plugin-for-wordpress.txt

I know there's a lot more to it, I'd love to see some docs for how to use more of the features.

I agree that some more in depth docs in an authoritative location would be good.

The plugin stats call is rather self-explanatory.

http://api.wordpress.org/stats/plugin/1.0/simple-facebook-connect will
give you a JSON object of the version stats.

http://api.wordpress.org/stats/plugin/1.0/simple-facebook-connect?callback=demo
will do the same as a JSONP callback.

There are no other options for it. Just name and whether to use a
callback or not.

Is there any easy way to add a custom filter to users.php?  I don't see any
filters or actions that I can make use of.

The only way I can see that might work is to inject the filter dropdown I
want via javascript and then hook into the WP_User_Search call with some new
query var that indicates the filter I want to use.

Any other ideas or suggestions?

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=bEg0Bwno0bUmfhobRKqbU9BE4Z0OAkW8SW=9P@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

What is the correct way to make sure a Custom Post Type uses URLs in this
format:
http://example.com / %custom-post-type-slug% / %custom-taxonomy-slug% /
%item-slug%

The custom post type slug was a doddle, setting up  http://example.com
/%custom-taxonomy-slug% is easy enough too. How do you combine them?

Seen a few ways of hacking it on Google, none of them seem right though ...

Thanks in advance !

I want to be double-sure that my 3.0.5 sites are OK for now.

I have used the membership plugin by wpmudevs.

Its the same plugin they use on there site to let you sign up and download content. 

I also know Gigaom pro and tuts plus used this plugin to handle there membership areas.

Hope this helps.

If not, would it make to include a list of CPT and custom taxonomy archives

Also I've just got a license on http://wp-member.com/ for a project, seems to be good after a comparison of a few plugins' features.

Be aware that a lot of these pay for plugins require you to have IonCube PHP decryption on your server - lots have that anyway.

Best,

Dan

Jesse, I've had immense success with MemberWing. It's extremely easy to use.

Hello,
When I'm inserting paragraphs in my posts, the paragraphs menu is 
"freezing", but everything is working fine, no problems. Actually, all 
the time it looks like it's pressed.
Check the image in the attachment to see how it looks.

Anyone else with this "problem"?

There was no attachment.

And what do you mean by "the paragraphs menu"?

I just figure that when you permanently delete a post (custom post type),
the attachment stay in the database.

How can I do, to delete a post with all attachments associated with it!

Is there a plugin to check if updates are available for plugins, themes and core? All I need is a true or false but a count would be just as good.

Why doesn't the admin panel alert system work for you?  When ever there is
an update for WordPress or plugins you can see it in the admin panel

As Eric said, attachments are stripped, and I don't know what the
"paragraphs menu" is -- is that part of the Visual Editor on the second row?
What browser, etc? We need more information here.

That said:

This is not the appropriate list for support issues -- please use
wp-testers. Since wp-testers is generally for alpha/beta/RC testing, the
support forums are an even better venue for this.

One of our security fixes in 3.0.5 was a bit overzealous. That aspect fixed
in 3.1. Otherwise, while there may be some security *enhancements* in 3.1,
version 3.0.5 is secure at this time.

Hello There,

Is there a way to get info about how many blogs are using the plugins I've
developed?

Maybe WordPress should offer this info on the plugins page, like it does
with stats.

Thanks in advance,

Best regards

I think the closest you can get is how many downloads.  Otherwise wordpress
would have to send communication to the wordpress server on every activation
and deactivation of plugins on every site.

Out of curiosity, how does WordPress get the "active versions" info that's
displayed on the plugin stats page? I always assumed that that was based on
active plugins... in which case, the total number of active plugins should
be stored somewhere. Whether not it is - or even should be - publicly
accessible is a different question, though.

Yes, I mean the paragraph menu from the visual editor. Browser: Mozilla 
Firefox 3.6.13. But since I can't mail on wp-testers, I'll write on the 
support forum.

Hi Folks,

The following question made me think

One of our security fixes in 3.0.5 was a bit overzealous. That aspect fixed
in 3.1. Otherwise, while there may be some security*enhancements*  in 3.1,
version 3.0.5 is secure at this time.



So it makes me wonder, is there any URL for checking this, perhaps, 
http://status.wordpress.org ?
Would be nice to know for sure when one really needs to upgrade.

Gabriel


Thanks,
Gabriel

Well if you read the update notices or posts about the updates, it'll time
you if it's critical or not. So just read the posts about new releases.

Does wordpress have a function to return the url for the page to edit the
user's profile, like the wp_login_url() function to get the link to a blogs
login page, or do I have to get the blog url and build it myself.

admin_url('profile.php') . The only difference is that this doesn't
take ito account Network Admin (which generally isn't going to be a
problem unless you're dealing with other users who also have network
admin privileges).

Perfect I just wrote a simple function that checks the wp version if it's
3.0 it returns admin_url('profile.php') or if its 3.1 or greater it returns
self_admin_url('profile.php').

Actually, for 3.1, there's a function called get_edit_profile_url( $user_id
), which supports the network admin, the user admin (global dashboard), and
the regular old admin too.

The function is written to properly support the new user admin in 3.1,
whereby in a network situation, a user might not actually belong to a blog.
Thus it might be wp-admin/user/profile.php in those situations.

Related enhancement I just created,
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16686.

Cheers,
Nacin

I think that this problem is because your paragraphs contain some numbers
also and
the paragraphs are old documents...So here is a way.

You can convert all the numbers in a document to text (i.e. to hard-coded
numbers). If you do so, they lose all their automatic numbering ability.
So I would **strongly** suggest that you only use this on copies of your
documents. There's no going back.

To convert all the numbers in a document, open the document. Do Alt-F11.
In the Immediate pane type ActiveDocument.ConvertNumbersToText and press
Enter.

You'll then be able to copy into another document and, since the text
has lost all its automatic numbering ability, it will just paste as
text.

Hope this helps
Warm Regards
Aditya Sharma

Message-ID: <AANLkTimeDMtxWWi7oku9d_pXttH+0G0WVTd+=Y-g9i_=@mail.gmail.com>

I understand that 3.1 introduces some fixes that allows me to accomplish
what I'm looking for - but because it's fresh out, Google isn't coming up
with much. I'm hoping somebody could lead me in the right direction.

Essentially, I have a custom post type called 'Treatments' and a custom
taxonomy called 'Treatment Types'.

I'd like my final URL's to look like:
www.example.com/treatments/[TREATMENT-TYPE]/[TREATMENT]

How would I accomplish that using the 'register_post_type' and
'register_taxonomy' functions?

Many thanks,
Alex

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_cron - How does it know if it's running?
Message-ID: <4D6B005F.4070204@skcdev.com>

I'm assuming wp_cron has some sort of built-in ability to determine if 
it should run a hook or not in the event that wp_cron is still running 
the cron.

So for example, you schedule a cron to be run every 30 minutes. If the 
task runs for longer than 30 minutes, does it know not to run the cron 
again, or does your function need to stop itself from being 'greedy'?

Also, if a specific cron is still running, how does wp_cron know whether 
it needs to run something or not if the job is still going? For example 
(using same 30 minute schedule), someone goes to your site and it kicks 
a sideload of the cron. About 4 minutes later someone else goes to your 
site, does wp_cron attempt to run your cron again since it hasn't finished?

Thanks for the help ahead of time gang, just want to make sure I'm 
making my plugin avoid overlapping jobs.

Message-ID: <15584838.1369.1298858501925.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@vbbfl13>

Just noticed in a response from Otto to another topic, the answer to my 
second question about how does it know whether it's running or not. Still 
unsure whether this covers job overlapping (30 min interval job running for 
45 mins, does the second job fire at the 30 min mark?).

In an extremely unlikely case, yes. There is a bit of a race condition
here. But it's tiny. The spawn_cron() function sets a transient called
doing_cron which it also checks for. Thus, if two hits launched at
almost the same moment, one of them will set the doing_cron transient
first, blocking the other one from continuing. The window for two to
run at once and both succeed is about as small as possible.

For those who haven't looked under the hood, a WP installation routinely 
and regularly sends a list of active plugins (and other info) to 
wordpress.org - whether you like it or not. So those stats (and a lot 
more) is available within the realms of Automattic.

And incidentally, that violates many companies' internal information 
disclosure policies.

Can you please point to exactly where this is in the WordPress core source code?  File name and line number, please.

If it is there, I'd be curious to see it.

No, because I don't remember the location offhand. But, you can do what 
I did: Start with the plugins code in the admin dir and trace it to find 
the point where it's querying wordpress.org, then insert a break point 
and dump out what it sends and receives.

I should probably point out to any devs developing a super secret new 
plugins and themes: Your project isn't really secret - some people know 
about everything running on your private dev box if it has an outbound 
connection to the Internet.  So keep that in mind when you're working 
for clients that have strict privacy policies, most large corps do.

Plus this:

$url =
"http://api.wordpress.org/core/version-check/1.5/?version=$wp_version&php=$php_version&locale=$locale&mysql=$mysql_version&local_package=$local_package&blogs=$num_blogs&users={$user_count['total_users']}&multisite_enabled=$multisite_enabled";

Plus more.

Is that really necessary to determine if plugins, themes, and core need
an update? Nope.

I mentioned it because people need to know since some company's have
incredibly strict privacy policies where such info leakage could
represent a considerable risk in their eyes.

However, nowhere does a WP install tell you this when you install it.

Actually, yes, it is.

- The plugin data is needed to try to match what plugin it is as best
as possible. There is not a unique namespace for plugins, after all.
- The version data is needed for compatibility checking (which we
don't do yet, but have planned). So that, for example, if your PHP
version is too low for 3.2, you won't be getting notified about it
being an upgrade since it would just break your site. That sort of
thing.

You are re-hashing comments from literally four years ago. We're normally
really good about answering questions and addressing concerns over and over
again, but it's time to go search the archives.

Ultimately, we're not unique in having the application send any of this
data. We're also not unique in building aggregate stats from this data. And
it's been done in some form since WordPress 2.3 as a way to directly and
indirectly improve user experience for users of individual WordPress
installs as well as those browsing WordPress.org.

The data sent by the plugin and theme checks is used to ensure we're
absolutely positive we have the right plugin. Name, author, the URL fields,
version (obviously), etc., are all used. Data is then held on the WP.org
grid while it is aggregated and normalized for WP.org plugin stats, then
discarded.

The data sent by the core checks is collectively used to determine which
upgrade package to serve. Some data points are also used for aggregate
stats, which we use to make important decisions such as when to drop PHP4
support.

You can block all outgoing HTTP requests. Or you can block just these. You
can also remove a plugin or theme from the update check:
http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2009/12/14/excluding-your-plugin-or-theme-from-update-checks/
.

I can definitely see why WP wants all that info, and I hardly think any of it is proprietary, but it should be noted somewhere, and I could see someone writing a plugin to disable the sending of that info.

Ok so I finally finished by plugin, i installed it on a test site to test it
out.  I'm bad with missing simple syntax things like adding a ; at the end
of everyline, considering the size of the plugin I am almost sure its
missing at least 1 ; somewhere, but since wp is not telling me what the
error was I don't get any help tracking down what the problem is.  Im not
sure why its not returning the error any suggestions?

Yes. The filter has five total arguments, with $attr being the fifth:

apply_filters( 'post_thumbnail_html', $html, $post_id,
$post_thumbnail_id, $size, $attr )


You're only asking for three. Try this:

add_filter( 'post_thumbnail_html', 'swift_post_image_html', 10, 5 );

It appears that get_editable_user_ids() was removed in WordPress 3.1,
breaking one of my plugins. Any reason for this break with
backward-compatibility?

Thanks,

Clearly spoke too soon -- the method was merely deprecated. However, in a
manner of speaking, the form of deprecating methods in WordPress could
indeed be considered breaking backward-compatibility, as methods are moved
from one file to another. It so happened that the part of my plugin that
used that method was only called via AJAX and only pulled in
wp-admin/includes/user.php. Since the method in question is no longer in
that file, my plugin broke. It might be worth rethinking the approach to
deprecating methods: as can be seen in this instance, I would argue that
moving methods around is an API-breaking change. While it keeps the
currently un-deprecated methods all together neatly, it can break plugins
that I think are executing perfectly valid code (only including what's
necessary).

Now more important is that I get my plugin working again. I could obviously
take the easy approach and just include the deprecated file, but I'd rather
migrate to get_users like a good programmer. So now my question is: what
parameters ought I pass to that function to make it behave like
get_editable_user_ids used to?

Thanks,
Scott

If you were using admin-ajax.php, you wouldn't have run into this problem.
:)

Otherwise, you'll want to include wp-admin/includes/admin.php instead of
individual files, as that allows us the flexibility of moving things around.
That's not going to be great for memory footprint, but for a one-off AJAX
request, it's far better than trying to peg where a function is (which is
never a good idea). We don't plan to change how functions get deprecated,
because this is pretty much the only hiccup, and it's easily avoided.

I'm pretty sure the main argument to match the functionality of
get_editable_user_ids() is 'who' => 'authors'. Beyond that, the other
interesting argument is 'include_selected', which is to include an author
who isn't included in the initial query, such as a post author who lost
permissions.

Hope that helps,

Message-ID: <24905179.1667.1298885873490.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@vbhw19>

So with a site setup using alternative permalink structures (rather than the 
default ?p=X), when you go to a URL with that ?p=X on it, it will redirect 
you to the correct URL. What I'm seeing though is while my browser may do 
this, and headers checks appear to do this, the wp_remote_request returns a 
200 and the content of the final URL. If I set the $options array to set 
'redirection' to 0, then I get a WP_Error, neither of which tell me the new 
URL. I tried to get the information from wp_remote_request, through the 
'response' / 'headers' keys of the returned array.

Anyone have any tips on how to use wp_remote_request AND get the destination 
URL?

Could you have another param that you use to determine logic of what
is displayed on your admin page so that the existing param is picked
up by the admin menu

The WordPress importer (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-importer/) is both an OOP
plugin (it inherits from the built in importer class) and also executes in
multiple steps.

Did you set WP_DEBUG to true in your wp-config.php file?

wp_remote_head() will ignore redirects entirely (ie. it returns the headers
of the exact url you request.)
wp_remote_get() will treat a max-redirections-exceeded as a failed request,
which makes sense under normal situations. However, returning a "normal"
style return in the WP_Error error_data field may make life easier for
developers..

Ahh right, sorry I misunderstood your question.

You shouldn't need to force the item in the admin menu to be
highlighted, WordPress should be handling that for you.

What if you try it with a simple plugin so all it does is add the menu
and print out a different message when you pass in your different
query var, do you get the same problem?

The Codex has information about the XML-RPC WordPress API:

However, it's current as of 2.7.1, so I'm not sure if anything has changed.

Hi Alex
1.You can add or edit pages over XML-RPC
2.It depends on the language you use. what language you are using?

There is a specific mailing lists to discuss things related to XMLRPC
http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists

<http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists>You will get more help there.

You've obviously never worked in the defense contracting or healthcare
industries. Royal, and I mean ROYAL freak-outs have resulted from
less. I've had to make many an argument and/or concession in order to
even get WP seen as a viable solution for internal sites in those
environments.

I understand that there are plugin(s) to turn this off and stop data
being sent out, however I do feel that a simple checkbox under
'Privacy', defaulting to on, to let this to be disabled would be a
more responsible solution.

Tonnes of software sends it's usage data etc to an external place,
which is fine, as long as it asks me first. Currently, WP users need
to know that it's even happening before they have to then go and
install a plugin to stop it.

I know this has been discussed before, but WP is being used by
different groups now, so perhaps it needs to be re-assessed?

Mark, I have several government clients who insist WP does not talk to external servers, as a result I have to strip this functionality from various modules before upgrades each time but overall, it's a great feature. It would be nice if there was an easy method for activating self containment (like airplane mode on a cell phone) but, I suspect that I am one of the few people on the planet who would ever use it.

With regards to the list of active plugins getting bounced back to wordpress.org

Can you give me a quick reference to where it is in the code? (I'm about to go hunting for it in a bit but a pointer would be useful)

It's easy. From my "Making WordPress Work AT Work" WordCamp Philly presentation:

http://www.slideshare.net/zamoose/making-wordpress-work-at-work/66

Slide 65 talks about making nice with proxies, 64 with integrating
into AD/OpenLDAP.

Let me know if you have any questions -- I've done a lot of this for a
Government Contractor Who Must Not Be Named.

Just to get you started, the calls to add or edit pages are:


   - metaWeblog.newPost
   - metaWeblog.editPost


You just specify 'post_type=page' to create a page rather than a post.
 WordPress stores both content types the same way in the database.  There's
deeper detail regarding the parameters you need to send in the code itself
(see /wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php).  You can also view the
documentation I've been building on my blog for the XMLRPC API ... the
MetaWeblog calls are documented here:
http://mindsharestrategy.com/wp-xmlrpc-metaweblog/.

Just for the sake of completeness, there are a couple of additional RPC
calls in the wp namespace for dealing with pages:

   - wp.newPage
   - wp.editPage

These calls are just wrappers for the metaWeblog calls I referenced above.
 They assume you're working with pages, set the appropriate variables for
you, then pass everything off to their metaWeblog equivalents.  If you're
building publicly-available code, I'd recommend using the wp versions
because it will be explicitly obvious what your code is trying to do.  If
you're doing things just for yourself, it doesn't really make a difference.

I wrote such a plugin. It's the first thing that gets installed on a 
site. It blocks the built-in WP update checks completely, and/or it can 
also override the checks to let them run using new functions, but 
without disclosing unnecessary info, such as what I describe in the 
following:

My particular point in the second reply from me was about the sending 
info about MySQL, PHP, whether the site is running multinetwork, how 
many users there are, how many blogs there are, what language the site 
runs, and so on. None of that is required to determine if there's an 
update for a plugin. That far beyond necessity.

I can understand how a company might want to track that sort of info for 
it's own purposes. However, I was flat out shocked to find out that it 
was being sent out. I had no idea. And I recall loads of rather harsh 
press that several well-known companies have received for not disclosing 
that sort of thing.

Anyway I can make the plugin available if people are interested in 
having it.

Thanks for this everyone. Wonderful stuff.

Just out of interest, is it possible to use any old custom post type
there? Could be very useful indeed, as one could write a script that,
say, updates a product list in an Excel spreadsheet into a live
product list on the website or similar.

All the best,

Alex

There is no active disclosure, yes. We've also been down this road
before and those making the decisions as to what content gets included
on the .Org and with the core distribution don't feel that this
disclosure is a priority.

My feeling is that this sort of info/process is fine for companies
whose very lives are lived on the Web (i.e., the vast number of
customers that WP contributors, consultants and users cater to) and so
the necessity just doesn't quite "click".  I also find myself
wondering if the government's addiction to Drupal doesn't coincide
with this...

Again, offer is appreciated, but the mechanism to disable it is already in core.

Someone really need to just make a list of the best of these Hackers 
Debates (Hackerbates? um no.. Hackerbaits?) and post them in a numbered 
list on the wiki.

Then anyone can just simply reply "#4" or "#6" or whichever is appropriate..

During installation, people have the option to set a certain amount of
privacy on their site (stopping search engines from crawling it), shouldn't
we also be asking if usage statistics etc should be sent? Explain, perhaps
there is a minimum amount of data that is needed for updates, and then allow
them to choose whether to send any extra? Or none at all, and disable
updates.

I just think it needs to be made clear to people exactly what is being sent,
why it's being sent, and make it easy for people to opt-out. Requiring them
to edit wp-config.php to stop data being sent isn't right (in my opinion).

Not sure if anyone knows this, but does the page get loaded twice or is the 
second time getting loaded from some sort of cache? I'm specifically calling 
to the idea of using wp_remote_head on a URL to check for a redirect, and 
then using wp_remote_request on the same URL to get the content / etc.

That would be the respectable thing to do.

If WordPress were still only used for minor blogging it'd be fine the 
way it is. However, those days are long gone. This is obviously not 2007 
anymore.

Since WordPress is now extremely widespread and used in a vast array of 
different CMS implementations it might be wise for the decision makers 
to take on some new perspective about privacy - before the media catches 
wind and proceeds to deliver a bashing.

If you think it's not possible then go read the bad press about Facebook 
and Microsoft doing precisely the same thing to get a hint about what

	Post Type
Message-ID: <AANLkTim-eRr7t-EGRoi-70HqZM_XfDWb-HfN3cHSUTZy@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

Dipping into the Custom Post Types and Taxonomy world and I am
wondering what is the best way to do this sort of thing.

Artist is an artist, which is a custom post type. However, artists
have multiple releases, also a custom post type so one can present a
deal of details about the release. How can I link artists with
releases? Obviously, release X under another circumstance could be a
custom taxonomy of Artist, but I want to have a little more depth than
that, so one can list /artists/ also list /artist/ with their releases
and have /artist/release

Any idea of the best approach here? How does one link two custom post
types together.

Thanks a lot for your help.

All the best,

Alex

Check out the plugin Posts 2 Posts:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/posts-to-posts/

I use it all the time on projects where we need to link posts from one
post type to another.

<ignoring all the flamebait>

To get back to the OP's question...

Calling http://api.wordpress.org/stats/plugin/1.0/plugin-name?callback=?
returns the percentages of active versions installed on sites. Is there a
similar API method to get the total number of active plugin installs?

Message-ID: <9388093.1126.1298919472272.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@vbbfl13>

I'm experimenting with running wp_remote_request($url,$args) with the 
ability to pull the URL using a logged in user's cookies. Now the trouble 
is, I'll probably want to create a new user with a specific role for the 
site, get / build the logged in cookie associated for that user, and return 
that in the $args['cookies'] for wp_remote_request to utilize.

Has anyone used the $args['cookies'] variable in wp_remote_* much and if so, 
has anyone attempted what I'm trying to do (maybe not the unique new user, 
but perhaps instead -- the reading of the URL as a logged in WP user.

I'm also assuming $args['cookies'] should be an array of cookie key=value 
items.

No, there is no way to get actual numbers. Only statistics are kept,
not the raw data.

Please prefix your functions. [1]

Also, instead of doing a version compare, simply do a function_exists() on
get_edit_profile_url(), and use it if it does. Better to check for features
than versions.

2 separate requests will be 2 separate requests.
What's the use-case you're working on here?
Personally, I'd do a normal fetch, followed by a head if it was a
exceeded-redirects error if you want the body, otherwise, the url..
But i cant think of a case where you'd want one or the other..

Actually, this is in regards to a plugin I'm currently developing. It's in 
Beta right now but it's available on WP.org. It's called Search Engine and 
it's like a mini-Google on your site. It spiders your site (or other sites 
too) and indexes content into the DB.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-engine/

<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-engine/>The use-case is that I 
want to be able to tell whether a page that's linked to on a site, is really 
redirected elsewhere. Right now, since I switched to wp_remote_request, I 
only get the content of the final destination page, without any knowledge of 
the path it's taken. So the best my script (or any script) can tell is that 
when you get content using wp_remote_request and it's redirected, there page 
exists at the URL requested -- oblivious to the real redirect happening. 
Previously I was using a home-brewed version similar 
to wp_remote_request but calling cURL and others manually).

So it looks like right now I'll need to do a little extra code to make my 
own wp_remote_request like function which does both the 301/302 redirect 
headers check and the body content return.

Not really. The wp_remote_request simply defaults to GET, you can change it
to be HEAD, which is what it seems like you are wanting anyway. You can
check to see if it is a redirect and then send another request. It does not
sound like speed is a concern (albeit one factor since many sites can quite
frankly get up there with the amount of redirects given Canonical URLs might
give you (Hint: Should be at most 2 requests, one for the redirect and one
for the actual page).

You'll probably want to use wp_remote_head() instead, since
wp_remote_request() is a generic function made to accommodated the rest of
the HTTP and HTTP extensions (there isn't any built-in calls support for
Subversion or webdav).

The spidering process can really take a lot of time for a large site, and 
can end up eating resources and adding time to the infamous php 
max_execution_time so I was looking to cut corners. If I've gotta do two 
requests to do this, I'll do it. Thanks for the advice and attention.

reason. Because the free version is just only or mainly for advertising the
premium one and does not add any value as is. I'm trying to put forward what
has been going on - I don't have anything against that model personally.

change wasn't implemented.

However, I'm working on a site that has News, Projects, Insights and
Events. For me, the best approach is to hijack Posts as News (with
some relabelling), then have Projects, Insights and Events as custom
post types. (I'm hacking Events so they publish even when set for the
future, so the publish date can be used as the event date.)

On the home page is a tabbed interface showing the latest two posts of
each type - and the client needs to be able to manually promote
certain older posts to appear here if necessary. Surely an ideal
situation for being able to apply the "sticky" flag to CPTs?

Of course I could have all these as post categories, but I prefer CPTs
because having a UI for each of them *greatly* simplifies things for
the client's editors. It's not just about having separate menu items.
It's also that I create quite a few custom meta boxes for custom
fields, depending on the post type. I'd have to wait until after the
user saved a post (and remembered to select the category) to put the
appropriate boxes in place, if I just used posts with categories.

I don't follow the logic that if CPTs appear on the home page, they
probably should be posts. It seems anachronistic now that it's very
common for WP to be running sites other than blogs, where the home
page is just a list of posts. My situation - giving an overview of the
latest of all kinds of content, with the ability to "stick" older
stuff there to promote it - is presumably far from rare. And because
there was refusal to even allow the option of "sticky" functionality
for CPTs, I now have to build my own system, do a bunch of extra
querying, etc. - or hack the core :(

Any chance of this being re-considered?

cheers,

Steve

If I distribute GPL'd software for a fee, am I required to also make it

No. However, if someone pays your fee and gets a copy, the GPL gives them
the freedom to release it to the public, with or without a fee. For example=
,
someone could pay your fee, and then put her copy on a web site for the
general public.

be visible on my profile.

Plus, afaik, the profiles are listed also as a gsoc project, and one of
the "hot" feature requests for that is some karma rating (you give
feedback on trac/you commit/you validate or contribute a translation/or
get @props -> your karma grows).

Though I don't know if profiles.wordpress.org are still on top priority
list. Last year there was uncertainty about changing/improving them, but
I might be wrong...

Good luck again.

feeds from all the services we want data to get pulled, we're cool.

All we need is to start indexing the following services too:
* GlotPress (not sure if it can offer some per user feed or global
activity feed)
* <locale>.forums.wordpress.org
* <ID>devel.wordpress.com blogs
* codex (recent changes feed)

Engine workflow
---------------

The best would be to have an api/feed we could query and get as much
data about as much usernames is available at that moment, with some
exceptions for:
* trac's global feed (including commits and bugs parts)
* glotpress global feed

Because these can contain information of different value and will
require parsing. Writing parsers for these feeds will update profiles
depending on parsed and found usernames and their activity.

One problem here, trac doesn't reflect full ticket changes in timeline
feed, and patching doesn't look like a good solution here. So I'm
leaving this for later...

GlotPress might require a patch to get a full timeline feed with users
activity, though I'm pretty sure I can write that patch.

Karma
-----

Parsers (SimplePie?!) will trigger actions, so I will be able to hook
and update any user profile once I get the signal. Karma will be saved
as user metadata. Karma values can be discussed/set later, creating a
screen with options for every type of update with a karma value is a
must.

Cron(ing)
---------

This one is tricky. The best would be to somehow make every service
independently notify us when there are updates, though this isn't quite
possible without using something like PubSubHubbub (which would be
awesome, though it will require every service we use to be able to ping
a hub). So the classic way to get the updates is to schedule our
"spider" for parsing the services.

Scheduling should not generate queues, so one parser doesn't wait the
other one. So the best is to use wp-cron, and enable an external dummy
bot to ping the new profiles/.org page to make sure wp-cron works when
there are no visitors too.

Storing data
------------

Post types for updates, with different names for every type of update.
So profile metadata/karma can be recalculated anytime :P

Custom taxonomy or Tag for every kind of update to mark/identify the
service and be able to query for the same data from other users. (This
one will only be useful for end users)

UI
--

Users will be visible as blog authors, so all I need to do is customzie
`author.php` ?! Easy.

Why not BuddyPress
------------------

I'm not missing any of the features BuddyPress can offer with the
workflow I described above, why should I add it as a dependency?!


Sorry for long post.
Feedback welcome.
Thanks.

allow users.ID, deny everything else.
However, also from memory, you need priv_select for columns used in WHERE,
and that applies to any usage of WHERE, so you'd probably have to allow
selecting the email column which might not fit what you're trying to
achieve.
It may have also changed in later versions as what I'm thinking of it old
info.

Perhaps you'd be better off offering a web-based API which applies the
security rules you need?

I would like to mention that this is a bit off topic for wp-hackers however,
and would probably be better suited to a mysql-centered list, whilst I'm
sure we've got some decent minds who will know this stuff like the back of
their hand.. It doesn't change the fact that isn't the best place for it.

clear who will define look of WP side (since this part is only part of idea
that is not clear), student or somebody else.

Several different ideas come to mind while thinking about how it could look
and success of project's result will greatly depend on approach taken for W=

You must have a serialized array in the _options db table that is pulled
from a single call to get_option(); Upon upgrade, you're wanting to add
array keys to this options array without overwriting anything that you're
users have changed.

The best way that I can see to do this is to use wp_parse_args(). This
function should be used when the users options are pulled from the db, and
before any option is used. Here's an example.

//this would be pulled from the db with $user_adjusted_settings =
get_option( 'user_adjusted_setting' );
$user_adjusted_settings = array(
  "setting1" => "on",
  "setting2" => "This is a text field"
);

//you can upgrade these all that you want
$default_settings = array(
  "setting1" => "on",
  "setting2" => "This is a text field",
  "setting3" => "style1"
);

$options_to_use = wp_parse_args( $user_adjusted_settings, $default_settings
);

This would allow you to forget the need to build an upgrade function.

"If the file isn't found in the include_path, include() will finally
check in the calling script's own directory and the current working
directory before failing."

This means if you're in WordPress' admin area, wp-admin is the current
script's directory and will be looked in before the directory the
plugin file lives in. At least, that's how I've always interpreted it.
