For those of you who had questions about securing your SVN logins, you 
can now access the repositories over SSL as well:

https://svn.wp-plugins.org/

Just accept the cert from the nice folks at TextDrive and you should be 
good to go.

Message-ID: <1109394539.14827.44.camel@portnoy.fuzzybelly.org>

http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=915

I attached a patch to the bug that removes wp-rss2.php, wp-atom.php,
etc. from feed links and references index.php with a feed= argument
instead.

Before:

http://weblog/wp/wp-rss2.php

After:

http://weblog/?feed=rss2

This will allow us to deprecate the wp-xxx.php feed files.

I also added some *_feed_link filters where appropriate.

Excellent, too bad we didn't get that in before 1.5.

Message-ID: <422088C3.9070908@skippy.net>

I haven't upgraded to 1.5 yet; and I know that 1.5.1 is around the corner.

I'd like to upgrade, but I know that some things are broken in 1.5 (like 
trackbacks, for example).  Is there a way for users like me to keep up 
with _just_ the bugfixes going into SVN without also applying new (and 
possibly experimental) development items?

I'll be happy to start using SVN to check out the latest _stable_ 
versions, but I don't want to run a development version on my system -- 
mostly because I don't feel like tracking the SVN commits to keep up 
with what may break my site.

I'd like something newer (and less buggy) than the latest release, but 
not something bleeding edge.  Is that possible?

Well, if you feel really comfortable with the source code, you could
go through and pick out the newer more stable functions that you want
out of SVN and apply them to your current version, sortof making your
own release that's a mix of everything.

There are no experimental development items.  SVN trunk is for bug
fixing only right now and will be until 1.5.1 is released.

Soon a branch will be opened for 1.6 code, and that will contain the
experimental features and whatnot. So trunk will always contain just
bugfixes, etc for the most stable version, and code from the branches
will be backported into the trunk, or something similar anyway.

Actually, just the opposite. Once 1.5.1 is out the door, 1.5 will be 
branched off for bugfix releases. From that point the trunk will 
contain the development version of 1.6.

At least that's what Ryan suggested:

Kind of a deviation of the norm though, isn't it?

It depends on who's norm. It is perfectly natural for me to create a
branch to support a previous release and to use the trunk for ongoing
development work. I do this on all my projects. In fact I've been
doing it for 15 years.

Same here, but only for 13 years.  Ongoing development always happens on
the trunk.  That's why it's the trunk.

Some branch strategies use feature branches that eventually merge back
to the trunk to form the next major release, but we don't do that.  I'm
not fond of that strategy since it is very heavyweight and creates lots
of sync/merge work.  However, even in that strategy bug fixing for
previous releases happens in branches, not on the trunk.  The reason
we're still using trunk for 1.5.1 bug fix work is because we haven't
opened 1.6 development.

I see. I guess I might look into that for my projects as well.
