Subject: [wp-hackers] Improving Meta Box Handling
Message-ID: <4C04681C.203@voceconnect.com>

Now that the first release candidate for WP 3.0 is out, I wanted to get 
the ball rolling on a ticket I submitted for 3.1, 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12450.  The idea behind the ticket 
is to improve and simplify the api for meta boxes.  Some of the ideas I 
had for improvement are:

-a registration like that of taxonomies and post types so that plugins 
can optionally apply those to any post types they add.
-an update callback registration, to simplify the checks a developer has 
to make against revision, AJAX, AUTOSAVE, etc.
-transition built in meta boxes (excerpt, comments, publish, etc) to use 
new registration.
-add handling to optionally check against capability before displaying 
meta box based on registration.

What are some features you would like to include or exclude from this 
addition?

At present there is no Term metadata available in Core WP. A number of
plugins I've run accross store the metadata as a serialised string inside
the Description element for the term, A few others create their own metadata
table.

There is a Trac ticket for adding Taxonomy Metadata:

Of note, it's a really short plugin:

Make wrappers for the metadata API (four functions).
On activation, run dbDelta.
On uninstall, remove table (optional).

I like all the ideas mentioned.

It would be nice if the metabox API had a class similar to WP_Widget.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Status of sitewide categories/terms in WP3
Message-ID: <4C04F830.4050007@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm on the verge of finishing a plugin (bbAggregate) which allows you to 
aggregate posts from different blogs in the same WP3 install to be 
aggregated based on sitewide categories.

According to this http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12666 this 
functionality has some issues, but it is not clear what these issues 
are. I have used the same functionality in WordPress MU for multiple 
clients with success and would like to be able to use it in future WP 
releases as well since my clients depend on it.

My questions are:

1) What are the future plans for sitewide categories and?
2) What needs to be done to keep the functionality? Regardless of it 
being part of the core.
3) What are the the remaining issues preventing this from working stable?

I can't find more info other than "the sky will fall on your head" with 
regards to the issues and the info in 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12666 is not helping (yet).

Any help or pointers on more information much appreciated!

All this is pretty much already there, isn't it? Let's run the list:

The fourth parameter of add_meta_box is the post type that the meta
box will appear on.

While these could indeed be simplified, I don't quite see how you'd
make a callback mechanism work any better than a simple if statement.

Goes without saying that you'd move existing things over.

You can do a capability check before calling add_meta_box, can't you?

This may be a good idea, but I didn't think meta boxes were all that
complicated to begin with. Can you give some examples of how this sort
of thing would be easier than the existing code?

Yes, but most plugins don't call add_meta_box until the 'do_metaboxes' 
action, which makes it difficult for plugins that add post types to see 
what meta handlers are available.

If you're able to register a save meta callback instead of having to 
work off of the save_post action, plugin authors no longer have to worry 
about checking against all of these before updating the meta value.

Yes, but the idea is to reduce the amount of code needed for a plugin to 
add a meta handler.

As the title states, the goal is to improve the meta box api.  All of 
this has work-arounds, but so did creating multiple instance sidebar 
widgets and custom post types.  WordPress is popular because it's both 
simple to use and simple to modify.

We refer to sitewide categories as "global terms." Here's a Trac search
using that terminology, http://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=global+terms,
which should reveal many tickets and changesets.

Without getting into the full details for why the sky will fall on your head
-- in a nutshell, they are very messy and probably should never have been
anything more than a plugin -- we are maintaining the ability to use global
terms. If you are performing an upgrade from MU, then global terms will be
on by default; in 3.0, they are off. They can be turned on again via a
filter (or DB option) along with the creation of the sitecategories table
(for which a function does exist). The filter, option and functions are
documented in the ticket you reference, #12666.

Likewise, they can be turned off with the same filter or by deleting or
modifying a row in the sitemeta table.

In case you don't make the connection., this is the StackOverflow idea,
which we discussed a little while ago. Now we can work on starting the site.
The other proposal that he mentioned was a temporary way to propose things
until the proposal site is ready.

Subject: [wp-hackers] $args for register_post_status()?
Message-ID: <1B5FE46E-7319-4EDA-B2AD-02E2FFE4C91B@newclarity.net>

Hi all,

I've been trying to find docs on the $args for register_post_status() somewhere and I can't find anything definitive on Codex or elsewhere.  The code documents three (3) potential $args values:

    * label - A descriptive name for the post status marked for translation. Defaults to $post_status.
    * public - Whether posts of this status should be shown in the admin UI. Defaults to true.
    * exclude_from_search - Whether to exclude posts with this post status from search results. Defaults to true.
    
but there are a lot more defined in the function:

    * label_count
    * exclude_from_search
    * capability_type
    * hierarchical
    * public
    * internal
    * protected
    * private
    * show_in_admin_all
    * publicly_queryable
    * show_in_admin_status_list
    * show_in_admin_all_list
    * single_view_cap

I've review the code in core that calls register_post_status() and can guess at the purpose of some of these in content, but not all. Many of these are "standard" $args names used in other parts of WordPress such as for register_post_type() but I'm wondering how they are relevent without having to trace through all the code for each of the properties. For example, what does "hierarchical" or "publicly_queryable" mean in the context of a status? Basically I need to define a custom status for a plugin and I'm just trying to figure out what I really need to set and what I can safely ignore. 
  
Thanks in advance for any help.

It would be best to look at how each is used in core. For example, we have
public/internal/protected/private to because we needed that many to break up
the half dozen or so built-in stati into appropriately flexible groups.

Some of those strings are quite unique and you could easily find them with a
text search, others could be found by searching for "->private" for example
-- simply search for uses of get_post_status_object().

I imagine the post status API will improve in a future release. It's new in
3.0 and thus we'll wait to see how it is used, how it could be used, and
what we want to do with it, not unlike how register_post_type came to be
first in 2.9, and how it took some time for full UI exposure in custom

An update on this issue. I incorrectly said a user can edit the custom posts
of others. They can't, but it *looks* like they can because they are
presented with the edit links.

For example, a subscriber with "edit_movie" and "edit_movies" capabilities
will see edit links for "movies" posted by an admin. If they follow these
edit links, they can modify the movie post, but once they click "Update", WP
crashes.

Were you seeing this behaviour Andrew? I've tested it on three different WP
3.0 RC installs using this mock plugin: http://gist.github.com/420859 with
an admin and a subscriber.

I've followed the edit links from their beginning in _post_rows function
where it checks if a current_user_can( $post_type_object->cap->edit_post,
$post->ID ) right through to the call to map_meta_cap but have to leave it
there for now. Maybe I'm adding capabilities incorrectly - user error? But a
subscriber user without edit_others_*** capability is definitely being
served edit links when using a custom capability_type.

While this is a logical perspective on the API as a whole (and specifically
how it is exposed in the automatic UI), I don't think it makes up for the
obvious lack of documentation in register_post_type(). In the PHPDoc there
is a specific section defining optional $args contents but it only has three
of the 16 possibilities defined. Why are those three present and not the
others? Is there a reason other than updates to the function that were
either rushed or lazy?

IMHO this is an example of a commit that fails to document the changes it
entails, which happens pretty often in WP, leaving new functionality obtuse
and hard to test for people who would otherwise be finding its bugs and
defining its points that need work.

*Proposal: Any time an argument is added to a function the changeset should
not be committed until relevant PHPDoc sections have been updated to reflect
the change. *

Is that controversial? Isn't it in line with where WP has been coming for
years and where it wants to go?

Always keeping phpdoc updated when making changes also has the wonderful
side effect that when you look at the diff on trac you see both the new code
and the new description. It makes things easier in so many different ways.

IMHO, the process of updating PHPDoc also has an editorial effect on code
and API writing. When you have to spell out in sentences what each function
is supposed to do you tend to realize the dumb parts at that point, rather
than after they are committed.

I'm pretty sure most people already agree with this system. I know that I
always document my own patches simply because it increases their likelihood
of being understood and committed. It would be good to see more consistency
with this from the core committers though, even when they are working on
code that is still in flux. Documenting prototype code will help others
understand what you are doing and test it properly, rather than hacking
around guessing at what you might have done, and when the final product is
ready it will be fully documented (and even the documentation will have been
read by the testers, so it itself will have had chances for revision during
the initial testing process).

Sigh. 

I've spent the past five days doing almost nothing but text searches (and tracing through code with a debugger) in WordPress core and plugins as I've been writing a set of plugins that require a deep understanding of core. I've documented with code-wrappers things that have gone undocumented for a long time (like the admin menu system), and things that have just been added (like the nav menu system.) My project which needed to be done Monday night is still only about 60% done because of all the research that it required. 

Then I came across an almost completely undocumented register_post_status() and it occurred to me that the $args were exactly the type of thing that at least someone in the WordPress community knows about and rather than spend another 2-6 hours of doing text searches and tracing code with a debugger I could just ask the list and hopefully learn from the person who knows in a 10th of the time. And I thought the minimum positive side effect that it would end up being documented in the list archives for anyone who needs this kind of thing in the future.  I figured this type of question was appropriate for this list so after being very careful not to post here much lately I decided it would be a reasonable question to ask.  Knowing the nature of the list I expected at least someone to tell me to RTFC but honestly I didn't expect it would be you.  

I guess then I'll just go and spend another 2-6 hours reinventing the wheel.

I'm concerned that this will splinter the development community, with 
official discussion happening via wordpress.org channels, and 
non-official discussions on StackOverflow. People already complain about 
there being information in too many places and it being hard to know 
which information is official.

I don't think it will. I've already found that any reasonably technical 
questions don't get answered (at least for me) on wordpress.org. I'd go 
here (at least at first) in the hopes of having a better response on 
technical items. I already don't go to wordpress.org with my questions.

People already complain about there being information in too many places and it being hard to know which information is official.

I don't think people looking for answers care so much it if is official as they care about finding a useful answer. 

Looking at the results of the archetypical questions proposed for on and off topic on the proposal site in just the past 24 hours, I think you should become less concerned about splintering and more concerned that many of the official WordPress support channels will become irrelevant. At this point there appear to be many people, with myself explicitly included, who find that the official discussion channels offered by wordpress.org failing to meet their needs. For example, my question regarding register_post_status() earlier today.  It's much like any open source project, if the project significantly fails to meet the needs of users someone will fork it. Just look at Mambo. The WordPress software itself is brilliant but the provided support channels are lacking.

So with a very promising alternative in StackExchange on the horizon those who need better support channels are seeking an alternate custodian to offer them Q&A support. Think of WordPress Answers as a "fork," albeit hopefully a very friendly and positive one for the community as a whole. :)

-Mike
P.S. *Assuming* WordPress Answers really takes off (as it appears it might), probably the best thing Automattic could do would be to embrace it fully and configure it to be served from http://answers.wordpress.org. JMTCW.

The lack of satisfying support would ideally spur the people pushing for 
stack to instead step up and help improve the .org support forums, which 
clearly need it. When your house needs a few repairs, you don't just 
abandon it and move to a new neighborhood.

If you really consider it a fork of .org support, then discussion of it 
should really not be on the .org list, but start its own infrastructure, 
no?

Starting a support forum on a different site is not the same as 
improving the existing forums on wordpress.org. It is a separate project.

I'm personally very much against that. StackExchange and that whole
set of sites in general is extremely user unfriendly. Even I find it
difficult to use and hard to find what I'm looking for on there.

I'd rather we revamp the existing forum structure into something
better, with new features. Forums are better than weird
"question/answer" sites that nobody can follow or have conversations
on.

So no, I'm not supporting this notion at all.

	SVN
Message-ID: <AANLkTimHPolSR9dx8Kymd3j_tcYQbftWqaRKmEKsJzNe@mail.gmail.com>

Hi fellow hackers,

I have been working with WordPress for quite some time now, but I am
switching over to Ubuntu on my laptop, and would like to take the
opportunity to build myself a killer environment, where I'd be able to work
in Eclipse, check out the latest version of WordPress from the trunk with
SVN, and commit and upload my changes to my own server without missing up
everything, and as easily as possible if that is possible.
Until now I was working with Coda on Mac and did not dare working too much
with SVN, only to check out the  latest version of WP, because I was afraid
to mix up WordPress SVN and my own.

A while back some of you exchanged a few emails about having your website
running from trunk with SVN, but I have to say I wasn't that interested in
at that time, and I am not able to find this back in the list.

Would you have any advices or opinions on this, maybe some blog posts you
may have written on the matter? Before to switch completely I would love to
have a good environment to work with.

Thanks!

I was in the middle of writing a similar response, I'll scrap it and fully agree with Eric. How about a "+1".

For Support: A Q/A format is great. The Q/A format groups the question, and a tidbit of the post in the search results. On the actual Q/A page, the question is on the top with the best answer right below the post. Subsequent threads on the answers are in tiny font. I have the Q/A, and further context if I really need it.

For Howtos: A wiki format is the best here.

For Development Discussion: A traditional forum format is best here, or mailing list.

Maybe this is more about UX Design of wordpress.org?

That 'fragmentation' concerned me but then I wondered, what can it hurt?

Many people have yelled for years that the wp-hackers list is too noisy. 
Others have complained they can't get their questions answered in the forums 
and/or they can't stand how the forum software functions.  Still others 
gripe they can't get the harder questions answered in #wordpress IRC.  And 
don't forget the ranting about Codex, where complaints range from the 
content, to the software that Codex uses.

So it would seem, people who are able, and willing, to answer those 
questions, desire a different or more attractive alternative.  If 
StackOverflow provides an experience that allows them to overcome the 
wordpress.org obstacles (real or perceived) and to contribute something 
useful, then that's "a win" for the community.

The focus of the StackOverflow proposal is limited.  It's not for end users. 
It won't replace the forums, it won't replace Codex, it won't replace trac, 
it won't replace the IRC channels, and it won't replace the wp-testers list. 
Based on the target audience, it would probably be the users of this list 
that would be most likely to gravitate to that solution.

If nothing else, it can be another outlet for those who feel 
disenfranchised, disgruntled, and neglected.

I agree with this, however that's why I'm saying that changes need to
be made. But switching to something like StackExchange is not the
solution. If some people want to try it out, more power to them. But I
agree with Jane in thinking that it's a bad idea that will do nothing
but cause fragmentation. I don't think we should support it from
wordpress.org and should develop our own solution instead.

I will certainly not be participating on StackExchange, mainly because
I still can't actually figure out how the stupid site actually works.
It seems to reward ignorance as best I can tell, because I'm seeing
tons of blatantly incorrect answers being very highly rated (I think
that's what the numbers mean, anyway.. it's so difficult to tell).
There's tons of spam, and frankly I find the whole thing confusing and
more than a little annoying. How does anybody get anything done there?

I disagree with that completely. You can do both in one place. There's
no reason that the forums can't accomplish the goal. The fact that
they don't currently accomplish that goal proves nothing more than
they need to change.

?
Why reinvent the wheel?? There's a solution that exists that is fairly popular
that we can use.? Why not see how implementing this solution works before
investing the time required to build our own?
?
I agree that SO can be a little daunting to learn at first.? Then again, every
piece of community software has its distinct learning curve.? It took me months
to figure out how to use the wordpress.org forums effectively ... and I'm still
learning how to interact with codex (beyond merely searching for information).

It is. It's supposed to be focused on code: core, plugins, themes, etc. 
Let's get it back to that. Discuss trac tickets, brainstorm better 
plugins, whatever. For people who want to help us improve the 
wordpress.org forums, please leave your suggestions and ideas on this 
thread: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/405965. One suggestion might 
be to have a developer-specific forum for technical questions. For 
people pursuing the stack overflow 'fork' idea rather than contributing 
to the efforts to improve official support channels, please take the 
discussion off-list to reduce noise on this list. Thanks.

In case I didn't make it clear, the proposed StackExchange site is for
everyone except the *end-users* of hosted Multi-sites (like WordPress.COM).
Those should have their own help system.

What you are looking at is the proposal. The junk questions (spam) are
off-topic questions, or rather, questions that won't belong on the site when
it is started. These are needed now to define what it is for.

+1 to this idea. What you describe sounds good.

An update callback makes a ton of sense even if its easy to do with a single
action/filter. If its so simple then adding it to the API will be easy too
and having it there will avoid time-consuming decision making and testing by
the people adding metaboxes.

While we're at it, can we switch over to using $args and wp_parse_args()
instead of so many impossible-to-remember-or-work-with arguments? Current
add_meta_box() has 7 arguments! IMHO we should switch to $args as soon as
there are more than 3 arguments, esp. when many of them are likely to be
defaults that you often don't want to override: do_thing( '', '', '', '',
'', 'FAIL' );

I wasn't able to respond to the later messages earlier because of a meeting,
but since I feel so strongly about it I do still want to make a comment.

As an open-source project, it's the community that defines what "official"
represents.  We're in a situation where a large portion of users (not
necessarily a majority) feel current "official" channels are not serving
their intended purposes.  In this case, it's the WordPress forums.  One
suggestion is to supplement these forums with a Stack Overflow-like question
and answer site.  It keeps the answers in a concise form while still
maintaining a forum for more verbose discussions of other issues - plug-in
ideas, theme collaborations, etc.  Since Stack Exchange is a freely
available way to do this, people have suggested we go that route since it's
there already, seems to be a proven-enough model, and it's similar enough to
a tool they've used in the past.

I doubt anyone would sincerely suggest that a WordPress Stack Exchange would
ever replace the forums, only supplement them.  Look at the structure of
wordpress.org as it stands - we have a blog for news updates, a forum for
community discussions, and a wiki for documentation and how-to articles.
There's no reason a question-answer stack wouldn't fit into the mix as well.
Using a Stack Exchange for now is the shortest route to having that
implemented.

Considering so many people are worried about a site like this "splintering
the development community" means that we all recognize just how many people
could use a system like this.  The fact that it could be a popular
alternative to a traditional forum is not a reason to dismiss it.

But my biggest issue lies in the knee-jerk dismissal of this idea as a
"fork" that doesn't have a place among "official support channels."  We are
a community working on a common project ... we define what is official and
we define the direction of the software and it's support systems.  At least
one person suggested that an answer stack could live on a subdomain of
wordpress.org, which would make it just as "official" and sanctioned as
codex.wordpress.org ... which itself is also a separate platform (MediaWiki,
if I'm not mistaken).

I actually hesitated to get involved with WordPress for about 2 years for
this very reason - the difference between "official" and "unofficial" in a
community-driven open source project.  As a newcomer, I felt like I was
getting software for free from a corporation that had no interest in my
opinion.  When something broke, I would wait for an "official" moderator to
respond to a question.  When I wanted to submit new code, I would wait for
an "official" committer to take a look and approve it  In the beginning, it
felt nothing at all like I was a member of an open source project ... after
conversations like this, it still feels that way.

The original proposal was to develop an answer site that would live on
wordpress.org and supplement the codex and forums.  If we want to keep the
discussion of that proposal off the mailing list to save on noise that's
fine.  But don't suggest that we're doing so because it's an "unofficial"
project that's competing with other so-called "official support channels."
All that does is insult the "unofficial" developers.

In a perfect world, I might agree.  But you are asking that we prioritize a project of at least 2 greater magnitudes of effort and at least 3 greater magnitudes of time over one that in 24+ hours has generated a really awesome set of sample questions and reached it's goal of 60+ followers as defined by StackExchange to move to the next level.  

Clearly there is interest and demand in the StackExchange method that requires a lot less effort and results in much more instant gratification.

Are you referring to StackExchange or the new WordPress Answers exchange?  If the latter then it's not about answers yet, it's about what are appropriate questions and giving bad questions are an important of the StackExchange process.  If the former, well I seem to remember you often have a unique view of what is correct or incorrect on certain points (just sayin...)  

If WordPress Answers does take off (as it seems it will) maybe it could have better answers if you did contribute.

If you can figure out WP core as well as you have for I feel confident you'll make it over the learning curve of StackExchange. :)

No matter your opinion, it's academic at this point.  It has inertia and we'll see if it works or if it doesn't.

This is probably the most obvious place to discuss it, at least initially. This is where some of the people who care the most about WordPress are.

Thanks.

The irony is that a WordPress exchange would relieve the pressure off of wp-hackers for answers and allow it to get back to what the core people want it to be.  Funny that nobody has mentioned that yet.

> 

Anyway, given that you, Otto and a few others here on the list are disinterested in the exchange I see no reason (at least for me) to continue discussing it here.  It does not seem like it needs any more advocacy at this point. 

So nothing more from me on the issue of WordPress Answers exchange on the wp-hackers list.

A big +1 on that.  I'd love to see add the admin menus functions (i.e. add_submenu_page() et.al.) cleaned up in the same way.  The $args model is a really workable and scalable model.

Hi,
I installed WP in Spanish and I am trying to change the word that
stands for "article" throughout the admin pages with another word. I
edited the language files searching and replacing all instances of the
translation given for article, but once I reload, clear cache and so

How can I do this? Am I missing something? Do I need to change some

Subject: [wp-hackers] help with custom query results
Message-ID: <AANLkTikjFKWbR6_2T5sTf7tIM8C7DLLw4GYKfbffTAye@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working with the following custom query:

$querystr = "
SELECT wp_rg_lead.date_created,
wp_rg_lead_detail.lead_id,
wp_rg_lead_detail.form_id,
wp_rg_lead_detail.field_number,
group_concat(wp_rg_lead_detail.value ORDER BY
wp_rg_lead_detail.field_number) AS resultsrow,
wp_rg_lead.post_id,
wp_rg_lead.source_url,
wp_rg_lead.user_agent
FROM wp_rg_lead_detail INNER JOIN wp_rg_lead ON wp_rg_lead_detail.lead_id =
wp_rg_lead.id
WHERE ( wp_rg_lead_detail.form_id = '3' )
GROUP BY wp_rg_lead_detail.lead_id
";

$results = $wpdb->get_results($querystr, OBJECT);
$resultscount = count($results);

______________________________________________

The item that returns as "resultsrow" needs to be exploded into an array
with a comma delimiter but I'm having difficulties doing so. If
$resultscount = 4, what is the best way to iterate through "resultsrow" so
that I end up with the following that I can then place in my layout?:

$result1[0]
$result1[1]
$result1[2]
$result1[3]

$result2[0]
$result2[1]
$result2[2]
$result2[3]

$result3[0]
$result3[1]
$result3[2]
$result3[3]

$result4[0]
$result4[1]
$result4[2]
$result4[3]

My final layout needs to be a number of rows with the fields pulled from
"resultsrow".

thanks,
brian

As for my last words for a time, I will mention that, as this is one of the
first sites that is being proposed with the new format, they do not have
everything ready yet, and the commit phase should begin later this week or
early next. So we'll be patient and continue improving it in its current
phase. We are ready for the next phase, when it comes out.

Hi Brian,

Yes, you would have difficulties.  wp_rg_lead_detail.value is free-form user-entered text and while I generally applauding using GROUP_CONCAT() it is not appropriate for free form text where the user many have entered a comma into the field.

What's more, the table design used by Gravity Forms is not relationally correct and is essentially impossible to process with only SQL as might be nice.  To get what (I think) you wanted you'd need to write a PHP script that handles all the details. I thought it would be a fun challenge to spend 15 minutes doing it for you; 3 hours later I now have a solution. Your luck is that at times I can be persistent in solving a problem.

Take the code you find here, copy to a file called something like "test.php" into the root of your website and then call it from your browser (i.e. go to http://yoursite.com/test.php):

http://pastebin.com/FSTGNz2i

From this example you should be able to get what you need.  

Hope this helps.

P.S. In general I think the wp-hackers list is not really for this type of question even though I answered it.  If I'm wrong on this others will explain.

Andrew, thanks for the pointer and the correct jargon so I can have a 
look in Trac. I'm using the db option, yet the table is sometime 
(haven't been able to reproduce it) not created. On my server it gets 
created after changing the variable. On my friend's server it doesn't.

Do I understand you correctly that by setting the site option 
global_terms_enabled to the value 1 (true) the table should be created 
automatically, or does my plugin have to call the function mentioned in 
ticket #12666 explicitly? In other words what would be the correct 
behavior of this feature?

Thanks!

It sounds as though you've changed the .po file.  Did you then make a new .mo file from it?  The .po is the human-readable file, and the .mo file is the one that WP actually uses.

Basically you're saying, "We should write it all ourselves so we can control it and keep it 'official'."

Somehow this strikes me as similar to a CEO of a company telling his IT folks not to use that "Word Press" thing for their site because "we want to keep control of our software".

Why reinvent the wheel?  StackOverflow exists, **right now** and you want to hand-create something that does the same job.  I don't get it.

After giving it some consideration I have decided against using sitewide 
categories. The current state and future of the sitewide categories at 
this moment does not look too bright. Since I'm under time pressure to 
deliver the requested functionality I have decided to rewrite my plugin 
to work independently from the WP core for aggregating posts from 
multiple blogs in one WP install.

For those interested in aggregating posts from multiple blogs in a WP 
multisite install: I will publish my plugin in the wp repository under 
the bbAggregate when the first version is finished.

If you want to use StackOverflow, then by all means, use it. You don't
need anybody's approval.

I will be working full-time to revamp WordPress.org in the very near
future (tomorrow is my last day of non-WP-work). So we'll do what we
think is right there. I don't think a recreation of SO will be in the
works, because I fail to see the value inherent to that type of
system. It strikes me mostly as a way to create a FAQ with a rating
system, not as a good way to facilitate communication among users. A
better approach to forums, with special services geared towards plugin
and theme authors (who are the most likely to answer technical
questions relating to their areas of expertise) is a better way to go,
IMO.

I will admit that it doesn't help me that all the SO oriented sites
appear to have been developed by colorblind people. I get eyestrain
trying to read anything on StackOverflow. Looking at ServerFault
actually causes me physical pain.

In the meantime, use whatever system you want to use. If you find SO
and the like useful, then use it. I don't find it useful, so I will
not be using it.

Does any more really need to be said on this topic? If anybody wants
to chat with me about it, my inbox is always open.

Who takes care of the FTP for the codex? I have been looking at it and
thinking that it could use a bunch of help. Here is a list of things that
need help.


   - The MediaWiki theme needs the site bar.
   - The Codex theme needs a few changes, not the least of which being a
   change to the way the views are shown.
   - The word Codex on the Codex theme needs to point to the Main Page.
   - $wgLogo needs to be set to the WordPress logo.

If you want my help, I would be glad to give it. I have done quite a bit
with the Mediawiki engine before, and would gladly contribute.

That's been my experience as well. It's rare that a search turns up a 
link to an answer in the support forums. Whether this is a matter of 
poor content or just poor search indexing, I don't know.

I agree. How can it be bad to have multiple high quality sources of 
information? (okay, "high quality" is subjective)

But I think there can be synergy between multiple support venues. 
Posters on the StackExchange site can point to existing answers in the 
support forums, and vice versa.

Otto doesn't like the Stack Overflow UX. Okay, fine. Personally, I *do* 
like it better than the current WP forums. We're both entitled to our 
opinions, and it doesn't make either one of us "wrong". And it doesn't 
make either resource "better" than the other. It just serves as an 
example that some people will respond more positively to one interface 
than the other.

Where I *do* agree with Otto and Jane is that I don't think there's any 
call for pointing an "official" wordpress.org link at the WordPress 
Answers site. Neither the WordPress Foundation nor Automattic has any 
involvement with that project, and it would be dumb to suggest otherwise.

There have been discussions about revamping them for a long time, so I 
think people should not view the forum activity as a knee-jerk reaction 
to the WordPress Answers StackExchange activity (or vice versa). I'm 
really looking forward to seeing what improvements come along in the 
"official" support forums. But I also don't view the two sites as 
"competitors".

Consider: why do we have both email lists and web-based support forums? 
As far as I know, it's because some people prefer one format over the 
other. Why should it be any different for two different web sites which 
provide such different user experiences?

Message-ID: <A8AB2DF0-6E54-46EE-B5B7-88FEDB6CE6C0@humanmade.co.uk>

Hi Everyone,

We have been working out web app WP Remote for a while now and are ready to start handing out some beta accounts.

The idea behind the web app is simple, as WordPress developers managing lots of sites it was becoming a real pain for us to have to remember which version each of the sites was running on and which sites we were supposed to be updating.

WP Remote provides a simple (but beautiful) place where you can add all the WordPress sites you want to monitor, it then displays which version of WordPress each site is running (using XMLRPC) and allows you to perform updates from within the app.

If you are interested in signing up for a beta account then either reply to this email letting me know or fill out the form on the homepage.

We have lots of plans for future features and are already working on a couple. Our vision is for WP Remote to provide all the functionality one might need for managing / administrating multiple WordPress installations.

Kind Regards,

Tom Willmot

An alternative to this whole route would be to create a plugin using the ideas and process in the following

http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2010/01/02/mangling-strings-for-fun-and-profit/

You would need to do some sort of search/replace but it would make it work for future strings too.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Wordpress StackExchange is ready.
Message-ID: <AANLkTimn3STFFnh8Qwb7FQnB2t9QX2N769ePzWp7J-Rs@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Hackers,

1) Fragmentation of the community

Personally, I google for answers.  Sometimes, I come across WP forum
or codex answers and sometimes SO answers.  Often, I find answers on
random blogs.  Lots of people like different things.  Some people like
forums, some like blogging, some like the codex, and some like the Q&A
nature of SO.  I personally like the rated answers of SO, as I get to
see what a community of peers thinks of the answer.

I've posted to the forum, because I was interested in a discussion.
I've edited the codex, because I found an answer an a blog that wasn't
in the codex.  I'm an active participant in SO, because I like to see
what issues other people have on things I'm actively interested in.  I
participate in this mailing like, because I like to see what's going
on now in the Wordpress world.

I use *all* the resources, not because it's already fragmented, but
because the question I'm asking or information I'm looking for has
different formats for an answer.  I won't stop receiving these emails
just because I sign up with the Q&A site.  This is more than a Q&A
list.  I won't stop using the codex, and I won't stop participating in
the forum (though something like SO has on searching for previously
asked answers while someone is typing in a question would do well for
the forum and is something simple).

2) Stack Exchange is hard to use

Though I am a web developer, I'm impatient and can be somewhat of a
moron when it comes to website browsing.  I found Stack Overflow easy
to use.  A question was asked, and answer was voted on by the
community and accepted by the OP.  Signing up for an account was as
simple as clicking the G for google.  It really is a simple and easy
to browse site, even on my iphone (though I've accidentally flagged
someone's comment instead of upvoted.  quickly remedied)

If you want to know what the Wordpress Stack Exchange is *supposed* to
look like, Stack Overflow is it's closest equivalent, atm.

3) The current support forum doesn't serve some's needs.

It doesn't.  As some other's pointed out, the constant, I have this
problem too posts don't help.  That said, forums are about
conversation, and there are lots of those I've had on the forum.

4) Improve current support forum or rewrite a wordpress custom solution

Improving the current support forum would include things like I said
above about searching previous posts.  Some other things, could be
voting, a who's who in the Wordpress community.  And probably more
active participation by those in the know.  The last is the easiest,
and probably not done.  But for myself, answering the same questions
over and over can be tedious.  The first part of this paragraph could
serve as a solution for this last.

Please don't write a wordpress custom solution.  Stack Exchange is
awesome as is.  In the midst of switching from WP2 to WP 3, is not a
time to go delving into another project.  There's going to be tons of
people looking for answers once the release is official.  Don't
reinvent the wheel, just use what's there.  Maybe, think about a
competing SE solution around WP 3.5 when the majority of major bugs
have been squashed and before the real gear up for WP 4.

Just my 2c.  Have a nice day.

3.0 is nothing special it is just the release between 2.9 and 3.1

Message-ID: <AANLkTimN62WzFVxtGGKC_I6rjdZHzL6_ebm9-oryhtZI@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

do you know if there is any hook action to call after a plugin activation?
activate_plugin does not work and register_activation_hook is not what I
want, because I would need to trigger some behavior when any plugin is
installed so I can't
pass the plugin file name to this last function.

I suppose this should be simple, but I honestly don't find any solution.

Thanks in advance!

I just used a simple workaround for this in my Changelogger plugin where 
I needed the exact same thing.

add_filter('pre_update_option_active_plugins', array(&$this, 
'your_method'));

http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/changelogger/trunk/changelogger.php#L272

Basically just compare the active_plugins option before and after an 
update. If values are different, a plugin has been deactivated or activated.

Message-ID: <f74bb13f-9097-4f7e-a7da-8879ec5a5d71@5g2000yqz.googlegroups.com>

Hi,

i was trying to override some styles (for a custom theme options admin-
UI page), but can't get around loading my custom file later than
colors-***.css from admin-UI. I used the admin_print_styles() hook.
The codex [1] says, that this would be the last one, before the page
get's rendered... but colors-***.css get's in every case rendered
later and overrides my styles.

I would appreciate every explanation (even if it's just "colors get
added after the last hook"), so i could open a ticket on this one.

Thanks.

This doesn't answer your question, but if you are trying to ovveride styles
on your plugin page - why not add a class to the <body> tag just on your
page? Infact, it should already have its own specific class..

Then all you have to do is add body.YOURCLASS before any custom style.

Just another way of doing it I guess, and you don't need to worry about the
order of loading.

Hello all,

I haven't seen much talk about the search API [1]. It looks like it's
going to be integrated into the core in 3.0 [2]. Is that going to make
it into the release? If so, does anyone know if the Sphinx plugin [3]

The search API project did not make it into 3.0. However, a new filter
introduced in 3.0 made it easier to plug in other search systems: the
posts_search filter in wp_query::get_posts.

An example using this new filter to implement fulltext is here:
http://skeltoac.com/fulltext.php.txt

I don't have any plans to update the Sphinx plugin to work this way.

Would this be the basic structure of a Sphinx plugin that worked with 3.0?

function my_posts_search($v) {
  if(is_search()) {
    // get all the post ids from sphinx that match get_query_var('s')
    // return " AND id IN ($ids)
  }
  return '';
}

Outside of that function, the majority of the work in the plugin would
be to get the data into Sphinx, right?

Edward

Subject: [wp-hackers] Geodata storage
Message-ID: <AANLkTimMsA0ZVRZWe9UKJYe5pCvfeWlDRhcmgV3bvF83@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to see all WP geo data stored the same way and in the same
place.  That way geodata stored by one plugin can be used by another,
by the WordPress mobile apps currently out in the wild, or any new
thing that comes out in the future.

I've put up a Codex page with the schema the WordPress mobile apps
use: http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata

Here's the meat of it:

geo_latitude: REQUIRED
 (float) decimal degrees -90 to 90 (negative
 values are in the southern hemisphere).

geo_longitude: REQUIRED
 (float) decimal degrees -180 to 180 (negative
 values are in the western hemisphere).

geo_public: OPTIONAL (if missing, assume public)
 (int) is the geodata public (1) or private (0).

geo_address: OPTIONAL
 (string) freeform textual description of coordinates.
 "221B Baker St, Westminster, London NW1 6XE, UK",
 "Pasadena, CA", "Soho, NYC", "Idaho", etc.
 Accuracy level and language is arbitrary.

Current implementors of this spec:
http://iphone.wordpress.org/ :
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8
http://android.wordpress.org/download/
http://blackberry.wordpress.org/download/
http://nokia.wordpress.org/download/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/geolocation/
WordPress.com

Advantages of the above meta_key names:

1. Lack of underscore prefix means the data is editable without a plugin.

My hypothesis is that people who don't like custom fields clutter
leave that meta_box off anyway.

2. Short and sweet.

3. Implemented and proven.

If anyone has developed or is developing a geo plugin for WordPress
and is using a different storage schema, I'd be happy to help with
whatever compatibility code the plugin needs.

If other keys ar needed (geo_accuracy: int or float: meters?), we can
figure them out and add them.

Hello everyone, Robert from Stack Exchange emailed me the following
concerning the proposals on Area51.

In short, they decided to do things a little differently, and are going to
reset all the votes on questions, and any rep gotten from them. Then we are
going to pick out the best 10 on-topic and off-topic questions. Each person
has five on-topic and 5 off-topic votes they can cast. With the following we
have on the proposal that should be nothing. The reason they did this is
because these questions are suppose to define the site. The followers will
not be reset, which is good, as that is the part of phase 1 that takes a
while. I attached our email conversation for everyone's benefit. The email
conversation makes it clearer. If you don't read the whole thing, at least
read the part toward the end where I asked what they mean by a good
off-topic and on-topic question.

Subject: Changes to Area 51
------------------------

From: *Robert Cartaino* <rcartaino at stackoverflow.com>

To: rcartaino at stackoverflow.com


 Hi! This is Robert Cartaino. I'm the Community Coordinator for Stack
Exchange. As one of our top participants in Area 51, I wanted to give you a
heads up on some changes we are about to make.

Almost as soon as Area 51 went online, we realized the system was not
producing the results we were trying to achieve. It was never our intention
for users to submit large quantities of questions and have everyone vote on
all those questions as on-topic and off topic.

Here is some background and related discussions:
Asking and voting for good (and bad) questions in Area
51<http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/52024/asking-and-voting-for-good-and-bad-questions-in-area-51>
How can we get better quality on- and off-topic questions in our site
proposals?<http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/52168/how-can-we-get-better-quality-on-and-off-topic-questions-in-our-site-proposals>

We are making a few interface changes to present the Discussion phase in a
different light. The purpose of the Discussion phase is for everyone to find
the 10 best on-topic and 10 off-topic question for the FAQ. That's the first
step in defining the site. Each person can submit up to five questions for
voting. From the list of questions, each user picks their favorite questions
(up to 5 on-topic, 5 off-topic) and we tally the results. We also added the
Meh? vote which lets users push less interesting questions down the list.

Unfortunately, the new voting scheme renders the voting data invalid.

We will be:

   - Removing all question votes (on-topic and off-topic)
   - Recalculating everyone's reputation scores

We will *not* be:

   - Removing any proposals or followers
   - Removing any questions
   - Removing any comments or comment voting

Any reputation gained from account association, e-mail verification,
followers, and other non-voting activity will remain with your account.
Existing questions will still be available for voting so reputation will be
regained when voting continues.

It is unfortunate that we have to undo work already put into the system, but
we want to work out these kinks early in the beta before the service is
announced.

We expect to push these changes sometime tomorrow.

I have a question. One thing I always puzzled over is what you mean by a
question that defines the site. Is it questions that are clearly on-topic or
off-topic? Could you explain it?

When an expert visits the site, they are going to see questions. And those
questions are *going to say to them "Yeah! This is the site for me," or
they're not.* Treat your selection of the "ideal" question is like an
audition. It's like an elevator pitch. You have one shot to attract that new
expert. Show them your best stuff. You're saying "At Plumber Overflow, we
ask *these* types of questions, we but doesn't include *these* types of
questions."

ON-TOPIC QUESTIONS
Let's say you were creating a site for plumbers (this is from the FAQ). One
of the questions is "How do I unclog a drain." Clearly on topic, but not a
very good "exemplary" question for the site. It's kind of basic and it
wouldn't really get an expert (your target audience) too excited. Pass.

The next question, "*If you run 2.5 GPM through 50 feet of 1/2" galv pipe,
how many psi will be lost to friction loss?" *Wow! Awesome question. That's
exactly the type of question I would like to see asked on my site for
plumbers. I would pick this one.

OFF-TOPIC QUESTIONS
Off-topic questions help define the site. It's a question you think someone
might actually ask on the site but is off-topic nonetheless. So, let's go
through the same exercise as above . On Super User (a site about computers)
you see a question, "Do cats chase computer mice?" It's obviously off-topic
but it doesn't help tell anyone what this site is (not) about. Pass.

The next question, "How do you merge your World of Warcraft and Battle.net
accounts?" Again, awesome question but Super User is not about video games.
This would be a good off-topic question which helps define the site.

I think it'd be a great idea for us to begin to think about creating
wrappers in core for this, much like the shortlink API we added in 3.0.

I can submit a patch with a basic API.  There's also been talk about
making geo a core plugin.

My only question would be "Do these match what we used to use in core back-in-the day?"

So far I haven't managed to track down an answer.

What sort of wrappers are we thinking here?

I guess something to output the geo metadata in the head if the values exist?
Plus: has_geo(), geo_lat(), geo_long()

Again, I wonder what we had for this back-in-the-day we did have something before geo in core died

So, could anyone enumerate the hooks have been added in wordpress 3.0.

If you svn diff the 2.9 branch vs trunk it should be easy for you to
grep through and find the new actions and filters.

Love the idea of storing geodata .  I thought the GeoJSON format (
http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) was worth throwing into the
discussion.  It can store simple point data, as described, but would have
the flexibility to store more complex geo data as well if a plugin wanted.

Would it be a good idea to store a post's geodata as GeoJSON in a single
custom field, and have the methods proposed in the codex (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata) retrieve parts of that data structure?

Here's an example of GeoJSON:

{ "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    { "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
      },
      "properties": {
        "public": "1",
        "address": "Pasadena, CA"
      }
    },
  ]
}

Message-ID: <AANLkTimSZEhXd4i8bfhUc6xH-Vm_P2li7kKRjWvHS55b@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I've created a reusable options page that I can use for multiple
WordPress themes. It uses add_meta_box and all the options are loaded
into meta boxes, so they can be collapsed, rearranged, hidden (via
Screen Options), just like normal elements on the Post page for
example. However, I'm starting to wonder if this is the best way to do
it. I like how they can be customized, but after reading about
register_setting, I'm thinking that might be the way to go. Would I be
correct in assuming this? Frankly I think the meta boxes look much
better, and add more functionality, but it requires a lot of extra
(bulky) code to setup. I'd normally be all for keeping inline with the
WordPress standards and making the option pages just like how they are
throughout the admin side, but right now I'm not completely convinced
a standard options page (via register_setting) provides enough
customization (that is found in most other pages.)

Which direction is best?

Thanks,
Spencer

The problem with GeoJSON is that you can't easily query it with SQL.

How often are you expecting your users to change the settings? Most
settings are changed once or twice and rarely looked at again. I think
the drag, collapse and hide functionality of meta boxes is completely
unnecessary for a settings page that will be accessed this rarely.

If, however, the settings page acts as some kind of control panel more
like the WordPress dashboard (eg. it provides information in addition
to settings) then meta boxes would be ok, I suppose, but you're
probably still overestimating the likelihood that your users are going
to want to customise the display of the screen.

Personally, if you've already written the settings screen with meta
boxes, then I wouldn't bother wasting too much time rewriting it to
remove them, but personally, I build all my settings screens to look
and act just like native WordPress settings screens for consistency.

This is a really interesting problem. The Settings API currently has a type
of page in mind for what you can create with it, essentially the type of
settings page that core WP uses. These pages show all relevant options in
sections inside a table with one submit button at the bottom which submits
everything. When using the API you can add extra stuff (html etc) to the
top/bottom of the page and the top of each section of the page. You also
control the HTML output for each individual setting's section of the form.

In theory the Settings API could be altered to use metaboxes for each
section instead of a heading followed by a table. This probably wouldn't
mess things up since all the output the current system lets you define could
be slotted into a page with metaboxes (page top would be above the
metaboxes, section top HTML would be at the top inside of the metabox).

Personally I think the existing solution makes sense for pretty much all
situations where you're dealing with actual 'settings', as in configuration
settings/options. While metaboxes are pretty and fun to use it seems like
most of the time they would be overkill for a settings page. If you only
expect users to visit the page once in awhile then screen-configurability
isn't really needed, and users are probably better off seeing all the
options when they come back in case their new experiences make them more
interested in settings that they previously thought were irrelevant.

It's possible that what you are creating is more of a management page of
some kind, but which uses the options table to store data. In that case
metaboxes might make more sense, especially if people are
creating/editing/deleting data objects, as opposed to changing the settings
that govern the behavior of those objects or their manager. If you are
creating a management page the Settings API shouldn't necessarily be changed
to suit your needs.

For example a contact form plugin might have a settings page that governs
all forms, separate from the form generator which actually creates new
forms. Even if the forms are stored in wp_options there are good reasons why
the settings page should be created using the Settings API while the manager
should be done with metaboxes etc. That said its worth considering adding
the contact-forms as a new post-type instead, as that might simplify the
creation of management screens with metaboxes etc.

Some very good points. I originally designed the options pages using
meta boxes because some of the themes had a large number of things
that needed to be changed, and I didn't like the feel of a gigantic
page of options.  Having them in the meta boxes allowed for some
sections to be collapsed/hidden. However, I've since recoded portions
of those themes, and they no longer require the amount of options they
once did.

Since the pages are really just straight forward option pages to set a
few things for the theme (how many posts in certain areas, categories
for certain loops, etc) they should only be changed once or twice once
they are initially set up.

I'm also more keen to using the Settings API as it will most likely
stay compatible with future versions of WordPress. The way I have it
setup now, I am creating *some* of the page structure myself, which
would eventually become out of date.

It just doesn't seem as fancy, but I guess those kind of pages aren't
meant to look flashy. Sometimes stuff just needs to be straight
forward.

Hey, can anyone discuss the use-cases they envision for WordPress and Geo data?  I understand the abstract need but am curious how people are using it.

I'm planning on using it to aggregate foursquare, Twitter and flickr
posts (and their geo data) and then being able to map things together
etc.

Also having this data allows you to do things like search for all
posts in an area.

How ironic.  I'm working on a project that needs exactly that (now why wasn't that obvious for me? Doh!)

That brings up a great question.  Is there a standard way to generate post search results ranked in order of location from a central geo-point?  (if not, should there be?)

You may also want to consider using multiple settings pages rather than one
huge one. There's no limit to how many pages you can add to manage theme
settings, so if you really have that many settings you can probably clump
them into a few groups and make useful pages to hold them. You can also
obviously create links at the top of each page to the others. This would
probably have a more possitive effect on the usability of the theme
configuration than tons of metaboxes on one giant unmanageable page.

That is a very good reason to use the Settings API. The styles will always
match because very little is left in your hands except standard HTML inputs.
The Metaboxes API is excellent and futureproof but AFAIK only if you are
using it on the edit screens where they are supported. I could be wrong
here, I'm not sure how you add them to screens that aren't post editors. If
you're reverse-engineering their HTML structure and javascript then you're
asking for trouble down the line.

Another reason to use the API is that it will handle a lot of the database
stuff for you once you set it up properly. Nothing that a PHP expert
couldn't do by hand, but every line of code you don't write goes toward a
bug you avoid dealing with. It also forces you to think through various
parts of the process specifically so that you end up dealing with
security/filtering because you have no other choice.

WordPress is already pretty fancy but with careful consideration of
usability at every turn. As the core settings pages evolve so will your
Settings API pages, so you can depend on them always being at least as
elegant as the software you chose as a platform ;)

I usually use Adam Brown's incredibly handy hook-finding tool. It can tell
you what hooks are added/removed in a given version along with context about
what file its in and a preview of it in the code:

http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks

It hasn't been updated for 3.0 yet but hopefully will be when the final
release is out. Adam Brown, if you're listening, now would be an excellent
time to update it, there will probably not be any new hooks added/removed
before 3.0 comes out.

There are already plugins that do a lot of interesting stuff with geodata,
they just don't save the data in standardized ways.

One obvious one that I'm interested in is showing a map (google or
otherwise) with points for recent posts. If each post has the meta set up
you use it to create a kml file or whatever that you feed to the map's flash
file.

I would be much more comfortable getting involved with geo data if there was
standard storage though. I'd love the ability to hop from plugin to plugin
with confidence that the data won't need to be converted (except for extras
that plugin authors can add in and use but with the knowledge that they
should make their plugin work with only the standard data if that is all
that's available).

I would suggest that this would definitely be plugin territory, but
that the groundwork to making it more possible/useful would be making
sure that anything/everything that was going to work with geo data was
at least storing it in the same place.

You should be able to (totally guessing here) filter search queries to
do something like this, once you know where to look for the
appropriate geodata (might require an external index of some sort, i
don't have much experience with searching on geo data myself).

Are you saying people would be encoding the geo from where they submitted the post?  I must be missing something, I'm not sure how that is really all that useful?

Me too. I hugely value standards.  I do think that code makes standards more pervasive though, hence why something in core or at least a canonical plugin that supports this would be helpful.

It would be useful to have some small stubs in core that do the storing and retrieving; code gets people following a standard so much better than posted best practices.

So the problem I'm getting stuck on is that every point someone might search from is potentially a different index and thus it seems that every search result would need to be generated by a very slow sequential scan of the database.  The best I can come up with is to build ad-hoc records in an table used for indexing that contains a subset of data that is near the geo point by a square grid, "index" those by the distance from my geo point, then cache the results for 24 hours from the last time someone needed them.  Has anyone got a better way?  (I'm really hoping I'm missing something very obvious here.)

BTW, if there is a good way to do index results based on geo and if geo data were to be included in core then having the searches available to work with geo might be something to consider adding to core. FWIW.

I'm more interested in the specific use-case of wanting to say where the
post is *about* (i.e. on a post about gaza the pin is on gaza on the map),
but that's not really important. If the geo storage is standardized it could
be used to associate a location with a post for any reason.

Like mdawaffe said in the first post the geolocation plugin from
wordpress.com already uses this format. It's use-case is very narrow
(logging where you were when you publish a post) but it serves as a starting
point for plugins that would want to do other things with the data.

Ah, that's more clear, thanks.  For some reason it just wasn't clicking.

Something to consider. If something is in a plugin there's no reasonably expectation that anyone will do it the same way in another plugin, even if written about as a best practice (because the develop may not look for the best practice.) Just look at how many plugins do the same thing only slightly differently.  However if there where a set of functions in core (or a canonical plugin) like get_post_geo() and update_post_geo()  developers would be much more likely to find and follow the conventions because they'd find then doing what they already have to do; search the WordPress code base to understand how to write plugins.

I am against having core add a new table, which is what would be
required to do fast geo lookups of this type. ?IIRC, MySQL can do
geoindices natively, though, so I don't think your approach is
necessary. ?I don't think MySQL is very fast at it, though.

My suggestion to plugins that want to offer this type query (or to
speed this query up if it ends up going into core) would be to require
sphinx: http://sphinxsearch.com/

Sphinx adds a dependency that not every blog will be able to install,
but it's super fast and has great geo search built in.

I think the common geo use case in most of the WP installs out there
is just: let me assign geodata to a post/image/comment/user and then
let me display that textually/on a map/etc. ?You don't need a geoindex
for any of that.

Using Sphinx is likely out of scope for this project, but what is required to host sphinx?  Wouldn't we need to have a VPS or our own host server to install and run it?  Do you have specific experience with it?

I used such data to display Google maps in author profiles recently.
Example: <http://ig-bkh.de/mitglied/toscho/>

On the first request I took the address of the member and pulled the Geo  
data from Google:
<http://github.com/toscho/Static-Google-Map/blob/master/class.Google_Static_Map.php#L232>

Then I stored this as a meta value in the profile (with slightly different  
names than suggested by Michael).

If WP integrates a Geo data API it should cover author profiles too to  
make this interoperable.

Thomas

There's a lot of possibilities. Why did twitter add geo data to
tweets? Lots of ways to use it.

Off the top of my head:
- Searching for posts made from a specific area (there's engines to do
this now for sites that put GeoRSS tags in their feeds).
- Displaying maps on the posts
- Displaying posts ON a map. I've seen a WordPress theme that does
this, the main page is a Google map and the pins on it are the posts.
Think TravelBlogging.

There's a dozen plugins in the repo to store geo data with posts. Not
one of them uses the same format as any other, unfortunately. I'm not
sure we need a core API, necessarily, but that's probably the simplest
way to make the meta data all match up in the plugins. Geolocation or
something like it needs to be a core plugin, IMO.

Jane Wells, are you sure? There is no other email list to ask at, and this
is most definitely a wordpress hacker question.

Yes, she's sure. This list is designed for WordPress core and advanced
development chatter, not for random questions "or something."

There are very helpful support forums at http://wordpress.org/support/, as
well as a general IRC #wordpress channel.

I maintain the website for a real estate management (apartment management) web site.  (Unfortunately, it's in Drupal - ugh).  We have a node type of "building", and each building has its location coded in that we pull up on an embedded Google map.

What project?  Defining a geo schema for core WordPress and/or
building a basic core API/core plugin?

If that's what you mean, then I agree: way out of scope :)

Yes - you need to install Sphinx somewhere.  It's not a solution
available to everyone, but it's a good one when you can do it.
It's pretty straightforward:

> Do you have specific experience with it?

Sphinx powers the WordPress.org Plugins Directory search.

We're experimenting with it a bit on some things for WordPress.com.

Sorry for being unclear; my own project that is for me serendipitously related to this topic.  Time and budget are too small.

Easy eh?  I'm a much better programmer than I am a system admin so it looks hard to me!

But we'll definitely keep it in mind for phase 2 when complaints come in that it is "too slow."  :-) (after the database grows significant, it is starting relatively small, i.e. < 500 records.)

Would sure be nice I could find a detailed article about Spinx implementation for WordPress.  (hint, hint. :)

Seriously though, thanks.

Thank you very much for answers, but for some reason container_class =>
false doesnt help. I still have that container div around UL, any idea?

Clear cache and refresh - it should work.

Also, are you using 3.0 RC?

As Nacin mentioned, you want:

'container' => false

There's pretty good inline documentation for this function:

I was trying to use container_div => false, but container => false did the
trick.

Thanks guys :) much appreciated for all your help

If you use the geolocation plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/geolocation/ then the geo data is
stored as post meta with keys of geo_latitude and geo_longitude.

Searching for posts based on distance from a point would mean writing
a custom query to retrieve post id's based on distance from some
point.

Distance calculation is complex, but fortunately the work has been done:
http://jebaird.com/blog/calculating-distance-miles-latitude-and-longitude

You'd do something like the query at the bottom of that page to
produce a "distance" column in your result, then limit based on
distance < X where x is miles or some such.

Once you have the list of ID's, you can plug that back into your main
posts_query.

Message-ID: <AANLkTin9WAJfnpZ5wKz4jFzCJQb54mDSFh2RVwVV4YqZ@mail.gmail.com>

I have been using the Multi-Site function in WP3 RC2. When I create a new
blog(site) I add the Meta Widget to the sidebar and once I'm on the
front-end I click on "Site Admin" to go to the dashboard. It doesn't send me
to that dashboard, but the root, because somehow it adds another slash in
the address...like:

"http://mysite.com/child-site//wp-admin"

Is this a bug that hasn't been addressed?

Did you add a trailing slash to the blog url? I tried that from the backend,
but it wouldn't let me, so I opened a trac ticket to make it allow the slash
if it was there. I forget what happened with it, but if they had fixed, it
this probably wouldn't have happened. :-)

Can someone look at the list of pluggable
functions<http://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions>,
and tell me whether all of them can be plugged by plugins? At the top of the
page it says "The most up-to-date list of core functions that WordPress
allows plugins to override is available at
wp-includes/pluggable.php<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/pluggable.php>".
Are these the only ones that are plugin plugable, or what does it mean?

But this is a perfectly legal question. If I would ask "are there any
pluggable functions in includes/rss.php, someone would answer it.

This is not a general support mailing list.  And yes I do realize that
there is no such email list.  But that doesn't make it ok to use this
list as such.  Please use the proper channels for support questions
which have now been laid out to you several times.

Arlen. Asking a question lik this is considered. Support request.  
Please post these questions in the Plugins forum at wordpress.org/support 
. We do not have mailing list based support, code related or not.

Hi all,

Is possible to define a rule, that if I have many pages

/contributors/john
/contributors/jack

Where last name is always different but I want that all refer to same page,
with a possibilitie to take name as parameter.

Where I have to start looking ?

Thanks.

URL routing in WordPress can be a real challenge. I've been studying it for well over a year and I still struggle with it so the way I'm going to suggest may not be the best way, but it works for me (modify the function names to suit your preferences.):

===[Add this somewhere in your page.php template, or other page template]========

<?php echo get_person_slug(); ?>

===[Add this to your theme's functions.php]========

add_filter('query_vars','my_query_vars');
add_filter('request','my_request');

function my_query_vars($query_vars) {
	$query_vars[] = 'person_slug';
	return $query_vars;
}
function my_request($request) {
	if (isset($request['pagename'])) {	// "pagename" assumes that there is post_type of "page"  called "contributors", i.e. that you've added a page with a slug of "contributors." 
		$parts = explode('/',$request['pagename']);
		if ($parts[0]=='contributors') {
			$request['pagename'] = $parts[0];
			$request['person_slug'] = $parts[1];
		}
	}
	return $request;
}
function get_person_slug() {
	global $wp;
	return $wp->query_vars['person_slug'];
}

HTH.

The hesitance is most assuredly not a case of NIH (Not Invented Here)
syndrome. Our goal should be to create sustainable communications
tools for the WordPress community. A third party site, running on
proprietary software does not meet our needs. I like Stack Overflow.
I've found it useful at times. But that's today. We're trying to
create a sustainable community around our sustainable web publishing
platform. We have to think about the future.

I don't object to use of Stack Overflow as an experiment, to see how
useful such a question/answer voting site is to WordPress users. You
certainly don't need any "official" blessing to explore that on your
own. But those experiments and their discussion should be in the
context of providing better sustainable communications tools for
WordPress.org that run on WordPress.org. Conversations will happen
where they happen. There are good reasons why there are back channels
(WP Tavern, for instance) and places for special interest discussion
that doesn't fit well on WordPress.org. But we're in trouble if people
in the community start leading little splinter groups away for one of
the core communications functions of WordPress.org: offering a place
for general user support.

Rest assured, the core team is well aware that there are ways in which
WordPress.org is falling short. We're even considering "taking a
release off" to work on WordPress.org, among other things.

In other news... everyone is running 3.0 and testing it against your
themes, plugins and server setups, right? MUSH! ;-)

..And now for a "proper" implementation of it... Mike, I dont get whats so  
hard.. Perhaps you need to start off basic, and work your way up, instead  
of writing a parser from scratch..

Implemented as a plugin, which you can view here:  
http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/example-contributors-rewrite.php

For the sake of people who wont follow links, here's the guts of that  
plugin, without comments, to show the difference to Mikes suggestion:


<?php

register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'example_activate');
function example_activate() {
	global $wp_rewrite;
	example_add_rule();
	$wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}

add_filter('query_vars', 'example_add_query_var');
function example_add_query_var($qvars) {
	$qvars[] = 'contributor';
	return $qvars;
}

add_action('init', 'example_add_rule');
function example_add_rule() {
	add_rewrite_rule('contributors/([^/]+)/?',  
'index.php?pagename=contributors&contributor=$matches[1]', 'top');
}

add_action('template_redirect', 'example_output', 50);
function example_output(){

	if ( get_query_var('contributor') ) {
		echo "We're viewing contributor <em>" . get_query_var('contributor') .  
'</em> in this example';
	}

}

Just to add a little to Andrew's response:

The wp-hackers list is a place for advanced development discussion
(hacking) and WordPress core discussion. This means it's not well
suited for general development discussion and support questions
primarily because a certain level of working knowledge of WordPress
and PHP is assumed.

WordPress doesn't have mailing lists for support and general
development discussion because there are better places for these types
of queries. The WordPress support forums and the WordPress Codex are
the main ones. These resources are much more user friendly and
accessible, and they show up right at the top of search results for
many queries relating to WordPress. These provide permanent, rich
resources that are easily accessible to everyone in a nice format.

In addition, the #wordpress IRC channel provides a great place to ask
and discuss development questions, though you'll often find that it
simply serves as an intermediary for Googling your query.

Now, upon saying all that, I appreciate that the wp-hackers Info Page
completely fails to communicate any of this to people (and the Mailing
Lists article on Codex isn't great either). This is an area that
definitely needs improving, but that's a subject for a wp-docs thread.

Hi Dion:

> ..And now for a "proper" implementation of it... Mike, I dont get whats so hard..

It may be "proper", but in no way do I see it as "less hard."  The (current) "proper" approach is fraught with complexity. The global nature of the regex's use have significant potential for side effects and must be handled in a plugin vs. a theme in order to support activation (i.e. flushing rules.)

> Perhaps you need to start off basic, and work your way up, instead of writing a parser from scratch..

I've written a lot of rewrite code for WordPress. I've run into lots of trouble with it (it's probably the most "fragile" component of WordPress that I've touched.)  And unlike the rest of WordPress, rewriting never really gets easier (at least not for me.)

> For the sake of people who wont follow links, here's the guts of that plugin, without comments, to show the difference to Mikes suggestion:

I'm very much for following best practices but in this case I seriously question if the standard approach to rewrites really are "best."  But then you probably also know I have a trac ticket open to evolve the URL rewrite system[1] that I have been working on as I have had the time.

The global nature of the regex's use have significant potential for side effects and must be handled in a plugin vs. a theme in order to support activation (i.e. flushing rules.)

The flushing of rules is optional. You can achieve the same thing by
telling the user to resave their permalink settings. This just
eliminates the need for that.

Is there a function to test to see if a post is in a specific category?

I don't want to return all of the categories a post belongs to, but rather
to identify if it belongs to one category.

This isn't really the most appropriate mailing list for questions like this,
next time try the support forums (http://wordpress.org/support) or
#wordpress in IRC.

However, this is probably the function you're looking for:

Subject: [wp-hackers] No filter for KSES allowed tags?
Message-ID: <AANLkTilt9LgDGzV88MnPq3_71OZtgVv4JsSkixe_Z3Aa@mail.gmail.com>

The $allowedposttags and $allowedtags arrays which hold the allowed
tags for KSES don't have filters on them. In order to override them
you have to define a CUSTOM_TAGS constant. This is a pretty antiquated
way of doing things, and these two arrays would be better off if they
had filters on them. (The CUSTOM_TAGS constant would still be given
priority for back compat.)

Just checking with the list before I open a ticket - I'm not missing a
filter somewhere am I?

I'm not 100% on this, but kses is used in the core in a lot of places.
A filter on these would make it slightly too easy to override globally
and thus possibly result in accidental side effects, some of which
could impact security. If you need kses for some particular custom
piece, then the wp_kses() function lets you define an array of allowed
tags manually, or you can modify the global variable directly, or you
can use the pre_kses filter to modify them... lots of ways.

I have a post on the topic here: http://ottopress.com/2010/wp-quickie-kses/

Hi Mike,

thanks, I appreciate your persistence! I ended up with a similar solution
which you can see here: http://pastebin.com/UAZHxUdq

Basically I believe I've solved my situation using a nested foreach
statement (which looks very similar to what you've done). I've set up 2
queries, one that grabs the rows with lead_id, and one that loops through
all rows where the the lead_id from query 1 matches the lead_id from query
2.

So, in regards to what is appropriate for WP-Hackers...why wouldn't this be
appropriate? Please email me off the list.

thanks again,
brian

Erm... create a role with no capabilities? On a more serious note, the roles
system doesn't have an 'access_admin' capability.

You will need to set up a redirection:

function no_admin_access() {
  if ( is_admin() && current_user_can( 'a_role' ) )
    wp_redirect( get_bloginfo('url') );
}
add_action('init', 'no_admin_access');

I tried to use CYC plugin (http://www.sugarrae.com/wordpress/cyc/) but this

I think that a solution would create a new function that create a form.


Another solution to solve this problem, is create all user login, register,
lost password all new.

Any idea?

Thanks.

I currently trying to do a business directory (utilizing custom post 
types and taxonomies) with "get directions" links and maps. I found this 
thread while looking for the proper way to store the geodata 
(post_meta). I'm going to tie the geodata to a geocoding API to fetch an 
address, and vice-versa. On this thread I've also found an interesting 
point: I should also consider GeoRSS :) An API would be great right 
around now...

Also, The API could cover the data sent from smart phones using the WP 
apps. That'd certainly be useful to users on the road.

Just catching up on some things, and thought I'd toss in some thoughts....

First of all, having a standard for geodata will be great. I've always 
been interested in geolocation apps, even if I don't do all that much 
with it in practice. I'm curious why you decided to store the lat and 
long values in separate entries? Seems like it would be extremely rare 
that you'd need one value without the other. I think a "lat, long" pair 
would be convenient, storage wise, even though you'd have to parse it 
out later.

Also, are there any thoughts on standardizing storage for structured 
location data? Since geo_address is free-form, it will be pretty much 
impossible to parse reliably. It might be nice to standardize a 
separate, serialized field ('geo_location'?) which could contain 
separate fields for address, locality, country, postal code, etc. There 
are plenty of prior-art examples to draw from. I'd probably start with 
the adr microformat:

If you're searching for posts based on location, you'll want them
separate so as to make use of SQL comparisons. WHERE latitude is
between X and Y, sort of thing.

There are Spatial Extensions in MySQL:

   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/spatial-extensions.html

There are functions for determining distance, or whether a point is 
within a boundry area (among other things). It's also possible to add 
spatial datatypes as fields on a table and to have spatial indexes. 
That's not really applicable to the metadata directly used by WP, but 
might be useful if you wanted to create a separate lookup table linked 
back to standard WP objects (posts, users, comments).

Good point, I didn't think about using BETWEEN to limit the searches. 
That would be a quick way to find matches within a rectangular area. And 
like I said, if you combine them, you'd still have to decouple them for 
usage later. So nevermind on that :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Post Types on Front page
Message-ID: <066D9E62-01DA-48F6-988A-0FD5617DA367@codehooligans.com>

Have been working with the new Custom Post Types and Taxonomies to build out a real estate listing system. So far things work great. Serious hat tip to all who worked on this. 

I've noticed on the Settings > Reading page there are still only the options to show latest posts or a page on the front. In my case I want to display my 'property' Custom Type. I've worked around this via code (below). But wondering if there should not be some way to have the custom types selectable on the Settings > Reading panel. I also checked the /wp-admin/options-reading.php code and don't see anything (actions or filters) that can be used to supplement this. Just wondering if this is to be some future enhancement or a don't care issue since there are more important things to tackle. 


add_filter( 'pre_get_posts', 'property_get_posts_filter' );

function property_get_posts_filter( $query ) {

	if ( is_home() )
		$query->set( 'post_type', array( 'property' ) );

	return $query;
}

Digging in the code of feed-rss.php:

<title><?php bloginfo_rss('name'); wp_title_rss(); ?></title>

I see bloginfo_rss('name') is hard coded in. Why isn't this behavior the default filter of wp_title_rss?

I was looking to set blog feed title's via the headspace plugin.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilBLihWhbyBRgMlALvVuOF2NLHdzO7f7KpHzhKs@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm keen to reuse the Media Upload overlay (i.e. the thickboxed iframe
from the edit post/page screens) when I need to upload files for a
plugin. It seems crazy to be reimplementing file upload and image
resizing code when it's built into WordPress core. However the hooks
aren't there currently.

More info in this ticket: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13817

Would appreciate any feedback...

Best regards,

Simon

I've been looking for this for a while - that would be great to have hooks
for the upload functionality in WP.

Thanks Simon

Hi,

Is it possible to have users select their admin panel language prior
to entrance or after entering? Without changing the installation
language code in the wp-config file of course.

Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Remove wysiwyg not working by deleting or renaming
	tinymce
Message-ID: <AANLkTilPy6eW9F0XXCr4gp6xal3b77f2yKU2DTGUJg0I@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I got 2.9.2 and I desperately need to remove the visual editor to
avoid users to paste all sort of unwanted formatting when they copy
and paste text from wherever (like ms word, which has a heaping amount
of trash attached) in the content of their posts.

I deleted the tinymce folder (I am sure you are all familiar with the
location of the folder, no need for me to write that down) and it used
to work with 2.6.3 but with 2.9.2  (and maybe even previous editions)
it removes the wysiwyg, but also produces a footer error of the likes:

Warning: include_once(/home/user/public_html/test/wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/wp-langs.php)
[function.include-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or
directory in /home/user/public_html/test/wp-admin/includes/post.php on
line 1472

Warning: include_once() [function.include]: Failed opening
'/home/user/public_html/test/wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/wp-langs.php'
for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:/usr/local/lib/php') in
/home/user/public_html/test/wp-admin/includes/post.php on line 1472

I searched a lot but was unable to find anything apart from removing
that folder. I would also be up to a function to be included in the
functions.php or anything.
Thanks in advance

Subject: [wp-hackers] Best way to do user caching
Message-ID: <AANLkTin41qNM05y9Z8y3uW1q4xLh6ndTrW3X_GQI6iaX@mail.gmail.com>

A while ago I noticed that sites with posts by many different users can
generate huge numbers of database queries. [1]

Michael Pretty suggested using the cache_users function (new in 3.0). I've
now incorporated this into my site but thought I'd write to the list a) to
check if this is the best way to do it, and b) so anyone else can use the
code if it's helpful to them.

I've put the following into functions.php:

function my_cache_users() {

    global $wp_query;

    $users = array();

    foreach ( $wp_query->posts as $post ) {
        if ( !in_array( $post->post_author, $users ) ) {
            $users[] = $post->post_author;
        }
    }

    cache_users( $users );

}

I call it from the template file just before the loop starts.

It certainly does the job for me (database queries down from over 110 to
10), but if there are any suggestions for a better way please let me know.

Cheers
Simon

Subject: [wp-hackers] conditional tags not working
Message-ID: <AANLkTinKU7EsWwM-8asaAk5MQGu7Ce8D6kEdW-oACA3-@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,

I'm making some modifications to a Thesis theme-based Wordpress site for a
charity and part of that involves a static homepage.  I don't know whether
any/many of you have used Thesis theme before but they provide their own
additional hooks for hooking in functions.  However, the hook for custom
templates is inadequate for my use as it still presumes one would want the
page/post content as well. So, I wanted to check whether I was on the
homepage and then add extra hooks.

So I have a custom_functions.php file that get's include()'d in the
functions.php file of the Thesis theme and in it, amongst other things, is
the following:

function front_page_check() {
 // echo is_front_page();
// wp_reset_query();
// if (is_front_page()) {
 // global $post;
echo( print_r($post->post_type) );
if ( ($post->post_type == 'page') && ($post->post_title == 'Home') ) {
 // if (is_page('23')) {
die( 'moo' );
echo( $user );
 // add_action('thesis_hook_after_headline','custom_homepage');
// remove_action('thesis_hook_after_post','thesis_comments_link');
 }
}

add_action('init','front_page_check');

The various commented out lines were me trying other things - none of which
work. I can only assume I'm doing something stupid but for the life of me I
cannot seem to get any of the conditionals to return true (i.e. the
echo()/die() are never executed (unless I comment the if)). Also my PHP
debugging skills are fairly limited: for example, that echo only seems to
ever return '1' but I assume that's due to it being a post object and not a
string? Did I just miss the memo that says they only work under
*x*circumstance?!

Anyway, any extra insight into the problem or possible solutions would be
most welcome!

Cheers,
Adam

Haven't seen it before but after looking at the cache_users() function it
seems like that is a good way to get only the users you'll need for the
upcoming loop.

FWIW what this situation really calls for is the missing get_users()
function, which should let you fetch all users or a subset as defined by a
role, post count etc. In many cases users are like wp_options, and you'd be
better off doing one big call that loaded all users into the cache than
worrying about individual database calls or the specific users you'll be
needing for this page.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can't get the thumbnails to work
Message-ID: <AANLkTin-cTyVMvTuryygzzNeq00pVMOd6G-ZqezhXQ_5@mail.gmail.com>

I just can't seem to get the hang of working with thumbnails in Wordpress
2.9.2.

I added the support like so:
if ( function_exists( 'add_theme_support' ) )
    {
     add_theme_support('post-thumbnails', array('page'));
        set_post_thumbnail_size ( 290, 90, TRUE );

        add_image_size('domain-thumb', 700, 270, TRUE); // for domain header
thumbnails
        add_image_size('cluster-thumb', 460, 90, TRUE); // for cluster
thumbnails
    }

And I add them to my theme using:
    get_the_post_thumbnail( $post->ID, 'domain-thumb');
    get_the_post_thumbnail( $post->ID, 'cluster-thumb');
    get_the_post_thumbnail( $post->ID, 'thumbnail');

The problem is that they are retrieved resized, not cropped.
I regenerated the thumbnails 1000 times using the "Regenerate Thumbnails"
plugin.

These are my Media settings. <http://cl.ly/314446f776c98028a7a4>

Any ideas on why?

Subject: [wp-hackers] bug in is_home in query filters for custom post
	landing pages?
Message-ID: <AANLkTilTi9hvZ5oNxU53qEkSayCeIMbWUsLFqilZHD0U@mail.gmail.com>

i've just installed RC3 and it seems that all the post query filters
(posts_join, posts_where, posts_orderby & posts_fields) are seeing is_home()
as true for custom post type landing pages, even when they're not the home
page.

in my case, i have a custom post type called "member", the main landing page
is mydomain.com/members (which is not the home page of my site), but the
following filter runs on that page:

add_filter( 'posts_orderby', 'my_members_orderby' );

function my_members_orderby( $sql ) {

    global $wpdb, $wp_query;

    if ( is_home() ) {
        return $wpdb->prefix . "posts.post_title ASC";
    }

    return $sql;

}

is this a bug or is it correct behaviour - are the landing pages for custom
post types considered a 'home' page? if so, seems a bit odd to me.

I don't know if its a bug as much as it is something that was never 
really discussed.  I think a lot of us that have been working with 
custom post types for a while now, knew that this was the case, but have 
never discussed if the is_home() functionality should change or if an 
alternate function should be made as a work around.  Personally, I have 
been testing against is_home() and get_query_var('post_type').

i guess there could be a knock-on effect for some plugins/themes that test
for is_home() and only expect it to be true for one page on the site. it
seems odd to me that you could have multiple pages all called 'home'.

maybe a new conditional is needed? (can't think of a name for it though!)

i also noticed that although the query filters test against it and return
true, if you test it in the template file it is false, so there is some
inconsistency there.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hierarchical Taxonomies permalinks
Message-ID: <hv6fe1$uh4$1@dough.gmane.org>

Working with a custom Hierarchical Taxonomy, I've noticed that the 
permastructure does not append the parent term to the permalink.

example.com/taxonomy/parent/
example.com/taxonomy/child/

In a default post category permalink, the parent is appended.

example.com/category/parent/
example.com/category/parent/child/

Anyone have a way to make custom taxonomies behave more like categories?

That warrants some consideration (or a swoop of the axe from an opinionated
core committer), but in this case, shouldn't you be using is_front_page()?
(or do you want this to run even when showing the "blog" page when a custom
front page is set?)

I do just the opposite: make (some) categories behave more like custom 
taxonomies. This way, I can use the wonderful category__and parameter of 
get/query_posts (all I got with taxonomies was just a single rewrite, so 
querying two different taxonomy terms at once was a real headache). (How 
I do this exactly is, methinks, out of the scope of this question, but 
if s/o is interested in the details, mail me or whatever).

For this specific problem of yours, I create a Page in the desired 
location, which has a template just like category.php (actually, it's 
the very same category.php, with a header to identify it as Page 
template, and a selector to retrieve query_var('cat') or a custom field 
in the Page, whatever applies). Also, some metadata needs to be added to 
the category; I use a custom termmeta table, but that can be saved as an 
option, just like parents.
As a final step, hook to get_term_link, and return the Page permalink 
instead of the default category permalink, if the category happens to 
link to a Page.

So, you can have
example.com/taxonomy/parent/child

... but if you wanted, you could even have...

example.com/some-taxonomy-wrapper/taxonomy/parent/grandson/third-degree-grandson/subset-additional-page

... that is, add some higher-level all-taxonomy wrapper category (useful 
if, say, you have "system" taxonomies like content-type, and "content" 
taxonomies like "foo", "bar", "barring foo", etc.), skip some children 
or "flatten" some levels (you could have movies/index/t/things-to-come  
"flattened" as movies/things-to-come , and also movies/index and 
movies/index/a), &c.

Anyway, maybe this trick can do for you. Create a Page template that 
reads some custom field/whatever to link it to the term, and hook to 
get_term_link: that could do the job.

Just to confirm, Since the start of custom taxonomies, non-category  
hierarchical taxonomies haven't had /parent/child/subchild/ url's (Which  
i'm honestly disapointed about).
3.0 hasnt changed that.
3.1 will hopefully change that including support for "$taxonomy__in"  
"$taxonomy__not_in" etc.

In the meantime, Here's some code which will give you "category"-link  
permalinks for hierarchical custom taxonomies.

http://dd32.id.au/files/wordpress/example-hierarchical-term-links.php


<?php

add_action('init', '_state_taxonomy');
function _state_taxonomy() {
     global $wp_rewrite;
     register_taxonomy('state', array('note', 'post'), array('hierarchical'  
=> true, 'label' => 'States', 'show_ui' => true, 'query_var' => 'state',  
'rewrite' => true) );
     $wp_rewrite->add_rewrite_tag("%state%", '.*?/?([^/]+)', "state="); //  
Override the query var, do this directly after registering the taxonomy
     // Note on the regex above, May look strange, but is to only match the  
final path item in the url, which is the child slug. WP_Query doesnt  
reconise hierarchical custom tax slugs
     // $wp_rewrite->flush_rules(); // Flush them on activation, not init,  
please?
}

add_filter('term_link', '_hierarchical_terms_hierarchical_links', 9, 3);
function _hierarchical_terms_hierarchical_links($termlink, $term,  
$taxonomy) {
     global $wp_rewrite;

     if ( 'state' != $taxonomy ) // Change 'state' to your required taxonomy
         return $termlink;

     $termstruct = $wp_rewrite->get_extra_permastruct($taxonomy);
     if ( empty($termstruct) ) // If rewrites are disabled, fall back to  
the current link
         return $termlink;

     if ( empty($term->parent) ) // Fall back to the current link for  
parent terms
         return $termlink;

     $nicename = $term->slug;
     while ( !empty($term->parent) ) {
         $term = get_term($term->parent, $taxonomy);
         $nicename = $term->slug . '/' . $nicename;
     }

     $termlink = str_replace("%$taxonomy%", $nicename, $termstruct);
     $termlink = home_url( user_trailingslashit($termlink, 'category') );

     return $termlink;
}

Perhaps we should introduce is_[slug]_home() as well.  Thus: is_post_home(), is_member_home(), and so forth.  Shouldn't be too hard to knock together a patch that calls something like:

    do_action( 'is_' . $post_type_slug . '_home' );

right after "is_home" is called.  (Yes, I think it should be *after* the generic.)

Why not just modify is home to accept an optional post_type parameter instead?

if (is_home('whatever')) ...

Then make it so no parameter (or blank) checks for the main home only,
not for the post type homes.

Okay, seriously. It's fine for anyone who wants to start up their own 
WordPress-related support site to do so. There are entire businesses 
built on it, in fact. This list, wp-hackers, is meant for discussion of 
code, not discussion of who should provide support and on what site and 
using which software. Let's try to use the forums for that, please, to 
keep hackers traffic to actual code issues. Or hey, bring it up on the 
*forums* mailing list with the people who actually moderate the forums 
and where it would be an in-scope topic of discussion.

Continuing to bring it up here is basically spamming the hackers list, 
because that is what it is when numerous messages about building a 
support site somewhere gets sent to tens of thousands of people who are 
subscribed to a list to talk about *code*. Let's try to keep the noise 
down on hackers. We have enough actual code things that need to be 
worked out that there should be plenty to talk about.

Thanks,
Jane

Subject: [wp-hackers] Post excerpts within the_content filter callback
	functions
Message-ID: <AANLkTim-16BoTEwf3amC_ZQoWksTzFLbooRCDxKO02HA@mail.gmail.com>

In short: How can a plugin fetch the post excerpt from within a
'the_content' filter callback function?

In long:

This is technically a bug, but I'm not sure it can be fixed easily, so
recommendations for how it can be worked around would be appreciated.

A plugin of mine adds a filter to 'the_content'. In the callback
function for this filter, I'd like to get the post excerpt. We could
just use the $post->post_excerpt property, but this will only give us
an excerpt if one has been explicitly set; it won't give us a
generated excerpt. So we use get_the_excerpt() like we should. Problem
is, the following code will not work:

function my_content_callback( $content ) {
	global $post;
	$excerpt = get_the_excerpt( $post->ID );
	// do something with $excerpt
	return $content;
}
add_filter( 'the_content', 'my_content_callback' );

The reason this doesn't work is because this will cause an infinite
loop in PHP if the post's post_excerpt field is empty. Why? When
get_the_excerpt() is called, if the post's post_excerpt field is empty
then wp_trim_excerpt() will generate an excerpt using the post
content, and this post content has the_content filter applied to it,
giving us our infinite loop.

Not to worry, we can get around this by removing our content filter
before fetching the excerpt, then re-applying the filter after we get
it:

function my_content_callback( $content ) {
	global $post;
	remove_filter( 'the_content', 'my_content_callback' );
	$excerpt = get_the_excerpt( $post->ID );
	add_filter( 'the_content', 'my_content_callback' );
	// do something with $excerpt
	return $content;
}
add_filter( 'the_content', 'my_content_callback' );

This is far from ideal, but it works.

So we've got around this problem, but we now introduce another
problem. Somehow, somewhere, our shortcodes have all broken. Our
shortcodes are simply not parsed and the body of our post just
displays the raw shortcodes (eg [myshortcode]).

Why is this happening? The do_shortcode() function (which is a filter
applied to the_content in order to parse all our shortcodes) uses
preg_replace_callback(). Because we're calling get_the_excerpt() from
within a function which is itself a callback function for the
'the_content' filter, it means we have nested use of
preg_replace_callback(), and that doesn't work (it's a PHP bug:
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16040). This is (I *think*) why our
shortcodes are not being parsed in this situation.

So to recap: get_the_excerpt() uses wp_trim_excerpt() which applies
'the_content' filter. Calling get_the_excerpt() from within a
'the_content' filter callback function causes nested use of
do_shortcode() which in turn causes nested use of
preg_replace_callback() which causes a PHP bug, and this breaks
shortcodes.

How then do we get the post excerpt from within a 'the_content' filter
callback function without breaking shortcodes?

A plugin could use its own version of the get_the_excerpt() function
which doesn't apply the 'the_content' filter - is this the only way?

Caveat: preg_replace_callback() might not be to blame, but if it's not
then I don't know what is.

Question: Are your shortcodes actually being applied at this point in
the code? Several plugins I've seen hide the add_shortcode function
call behind some sort of function that only takes place on the main
blog page itself, not in the admin screens.

I'll give you an example from Nextgen Gallery:

// Load backend libraries
if ( is_admin() ) {	
	... load a bunch of stuff here ...
// Load frontend libraries							
} else {
...
	require_once (dirname (__FILE__) . '/lib/shortcodes.php'); 		// 92.664
}	

In this case, the shortcode processing bits are only loaded in the
non-admin screens. So, if your code which is trying to get that
excerpt is in the admin screens, then the shortcodes, which are not
loaded, won't be processed.

The key is to make sure that your shortcode functions are *always*
loaded, even in the admin areas. This way, anything trying to get the
content will get the shortcodes processed into normal HTML.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Related Posts spam?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimiBy145ohAH9fkGsbzzOMYPs-4lfHin-y4Z9te@mail.gmail.com>

Is anybody else experiencing this phenomenon?  Basically, every time I
make a post lately, I get hundreds of spam trackbacks to it from blogs
which have the post show up in some kind of "related posts" plugin.

Example:
I made this post:
http://ottopress.com/2010/wordpress-theme-tip-force-an-image-size/
I get linked to from this sort of post:
http://www.thesleepingbagshop.com/sleeping-bags/slumberjack-tourlite-40f-regular-sleeping-bag/

Simple Trackback Validation doesn't stop it because that blog really
is linking to me, albeit by some brain dead algorithm that has
determined that my post is somehow "related".

I've received over 400 trackbacks in this way on that post alone.
Virtually all of them from unrelated sorts of posts. Akismet catches
the majority, but still enough are making it through to become an
annoyance.

Anybody have an idea how to solve or block these?

Yep. I'm using a test shortcode plugin which just outputs some text,
but I noticed the problem originally with shortcodes in my own 'Plugin
Info' plugin and subsequently tested it with a few other random
plugins that use shortcodes.

I'm only testing it on the blog's front page. Haven't tested it on
posts in the admin screens.

The plugin outputs the excerpt above the post content, but in the
process kills any shortcodes for any plugins you have installed,
including the [testy] shortcode included in the plugin. If you remove
the 'the_content' filter, shortcodes work fine.

Hey Otto,

Not sure if this helps, but it looks like the offending blog shows a ul
class of "pc_pingback" wrapping the related posts.  After a quick Google
search for "pc_pingback", this looks like the plugin:

@Otto

A look at source of the url you gave (
http://www.thesleepingbagshop.com/sleeping-bags/slumberjack-tourlite-40f-regular-sleeping-bag/)
shows that the related blogs section has a class of pc_pingback. A
search
on google for pc_pingback turns up
http://joshteam.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/pingcrawl-wordpress-plugin/

It works thus (according to the website)

**

   - The plugin will listen to anytime a post is saved, published, updated,
   etc.
   - The plugin on execution time will find all the tags on the post and
   perform the following per tag:
      - Use Google API to check for ( 35 ) results with the tag name.
      - With the ( 35 ) results it loops through them and performs the
      following
         - Does the result have a pingback meta tag?
         - Does the result have trackback somewhere in the source
         - (if yes to both) it stores the pingback xmlrpc location in
         memory.
         - (if no to either) we skip that record and move to the next.
         - Once their are 5 legit pingable servers we then append their
         links to the post we currently added.
         - We then retrieve the xmlrpc urls from memory, and execute
         a pingback.ping against the xmlrpc as defined in the pingback 1.0
         spec <http://hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0>.



A bit of irony. The offending website (the sleeping bags website) is using
a  spam plugin to stop comment spam.

Perhaps a look at the plugins source (
http://joshteam.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/pingcrawl2/ ) will reveal a method
to block it? (I would look but I won't get the time for at least a month or
2)

Maybe try something like...

function my_content_callback( $content ) {
	global $post;
	static $flag = 0;
	while (0 == $flag++) {
		$excerpt = get_the_excerpt( $post->ID );
		// do something with $excerpt
	}
	return $content;
}
add_filter( 'the_content', 'my_content_callback' );

The first time through, it should call your excerpt function, but when 
wp_trim_excerpt() calls your filter again, the static $flag variable 
should be 1, and skip calling get_the_excerpt() again.

I haven't actually tested it, but I think that should work.

Try this:

function content( $content ) {
     global $wp_current_filter;
     if ( !in_array( 'get_the_excerpt', $wp_current_filter ) ) {
         $excerpt = get_the_excerpt();

Subject: [wp-hackers] Theme setting location
Message-ID: <AANLkTilrxmCBZEqMozjr4sGouwzfb3WM-SbMffSbprO-@mail.gmail.com>

I've got an idea to play around with the location of my theme, but I can not
seem to find where the active theme is defined as far as paths, etc.. Can
someone give me a clue as to where wordpress stores this information. I've
looked through just about every record in the DB, but its not there, so I'm
assuming it updates a file somewhere. Same question for the plugins.

It's the 'stylesheet' and 'template' rows in the options table.
Plugins are in the 'active_plugins' row in the same table.

Thanks, I wasn't looking at everything in the table. Can't get used to
PHPAdmin since I'm from a Windows background.

Subject: [wp-hackers] What do you name the localization .mo when the locale
	is not set?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimhIKBBxAxb3v03dhf-dNQf5dFtMnEPFipMWcQ-@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a localized template and have my .mo working fine for default
installs of WP. Love it: Just use _e('whatever', 'textdomain') and it echos
out the value based on the "whatever" key.

Unfortunately, my code fails after taking it from my personal dev
environment into a professional one. I've troubleshooted what I can and
think it's because the locale is not set on the new dev environment. I ran
this code to check:

<?php
$locale = get_locale();
if($locale == "en_US") {
   echo "english: $locale";
} else { echo "not english: $locale"; } ?>

In the working dev environment, it echos out "english: en_US"

In the non-working dev environment, it echos out "not english: "

In both installs the WP_Lang constant is not set (wp-config: "define
('WPLANG', '');"). It's a bit confusing to me as to why one install defaults
to en_US (as I might expect) but the other doesn't seem to have the locale
set at all. In any case, I suspect my .mo is failing because it's named
en_US.mo in the theme folder and since the locale on the second setup is not
en_US it's not finding it.

In any case, I figure my .mo has a chance if I name it the right thing for a
WP install with no language set. Is there such a namespace? What do you name
the localization .mo when the locale doesn't seem to be set?

Thank you!

A small example, works fine.
i have this in a function and hook this on init (WordPress smaller
3.0) and greater
than or equal WP 3.0 via hook after_setup_theme.

    define( 'FB_GREYFOTO_TEXTDOMAIN', 'photoblog' );

    if ( defined( 'WPLANG') )
        $locale = WPLANG;
    if ( empty($locale) )
        $locale = 'en_US';
    load_theme_textdomain( FB_GREYFOTO_TEXTDOMAIN );
    $locale = get_locale();
    $locale_file = TEMPLATEPATH . '/languages/' . $locale . '.php';
    if ( is_readable( $locale_file ) )
        require_once( $locale_file );

The default is indeed en_US. See the get_locale() function in the l10n.php file.

Thanks Frank! I've seen code like that in the past. I haven't seen an
explanation of what /langages/$locale.php does. I don't think I have a file
like this in my theme. I can't get your code working for me yet but I'm
optimistic. Can you tell me what it does and why I need it?

$locale_file is only interestet for use the subfolder with a php-file for
custom functions for a language
Example: in my language we have special strings ? ? ? etc. and WordPress has
on default problems with this. When active the language de_DE, then i will
include the de_DE.php for remove this problems and include my functions.
This problem give it in many languages and WordPress has the same function
for the translation-files on core in folder wp-content/languages

There must have been some higher-level code in the theme -- huge, not coded
by me -- that was unsetting the locale. Setting it in wp-config.php didn't
change the output of my unit test and I couldn't reset it on the fly.

But I went into the code for load_theme_textdomain() and saw it was more or
less just a stub for load_textdomain(). Just called that instead, specifying
the .mo filepath myself, and voila -- it works.

If you can specify the $path, I wonder why you can't just specify the
location of the .mo? Maybe the design was intended to enforce "good coding
practices" or whatever and make people name their .mo a certain way. In any
case, a more direct approach worked better for me.

Thanks Frank and Otto for your responses. I plan to hang around this mailing
list more often and answer some questions when I have answers, so perhaps I
can soon return the favor.

<../_functions/load_child_theme_textdomain.html>($domain

If you can get remote access to the server use HeidiSQL. It's a free download for Windows and it's awesome.

In Matt's release notes, he mentioned "We?re going to take a release cycle
off to focus on all of the things around WordPress."

One of those things should be long term support for the huge amount of
commercial web properties now using WP that are caught in the never-ending
cycle of release-update.

I once again wish that Wordpress would adopt a two-pronged release strategy.
Yes, go ahead and release the latest, greatest bleeding edge version as your
main release. But please, PLEASE, start a long-term-support (LTS) branch.
Backport all the security fixes and keep something stable for at least the
previous release version.

As Wordpress gets bigger, more and more companies are using it. Companies
that are using it for more than their personal blog. Companies that are
using it as a CMS, as their primary website, or for countless other cases.
Unlike if your personal blog goes down, having one of these sites go down
can create havoc for an entire company's bottom line.

Having to continually update a website because of security enhancements
isn't a big deal. Updating a website because of some cool new feature, a
feature that can introduce new bugs and security flaws, shouldn't be
mandatory.

I'm sorry for bringing this up again, and I'm sorry if you feel it's off
topic, but you are the only developers who can make it happen.

We tried this in the past with 2.0 and we found the following:

 * Actually very few people used it
 * Alot of the security improvements and fixes we made post 2.0 were not trivial and backporting them would have taken a lot of time and testing

I would happily support and maintain a LTS branch for WordPress if there was a community around that really wanted it.

This really means that if this is something you want and you have clients that want then please provide patches and help us reach the goal you aspire.

It needs to be a community effort it is not something we can do on our own - the time would be better spent supporting the millions of people who do upgrade.

It would be interesting to see the difference in the overall user base from
2.0 to 2.9/3.0. I would venture to guess that there are significantly far
more commercial entities using a current version of WP for their main web
properties than <= 2.0, and those commercial entities would be more likely
to either sponsor or support a LTS branch.

Just looking at the features released with 2.0, I can see why it would have
been a pain to back port:

http://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/

But taking a second look at that, all of those features that were added were
drastic, and are essentially foundational now. I don't foresee much being
added to WP that would be that drastic of a change.

If I were more of a developer, I'd be on the front lines helping out. As it
is, I'm just a theme/plugin developer and user. But I'd be happy to work as
an evangelizer, if there's a need for one :)

In addition to what westi said,  another issue I see with adopting the
LTS concept is allocation of planned additions and changes between LTS
and non-LTS.  Because, obviously, you don?t want to provide long-term
support for a release which experimented too much and is more likely
to introduce issues.

Now, determining in advance what is safe for an LTS is not easy.  Some
things, like the MU merge, would obviously not fit in an LTS, but the
line is not as easy to draw in all cases.  This would make planning
difficult.

These are just some thoughts.  I am not opposed in principle to the
concept of LTS.

Cheers, and congratulations to all for 3.0!

I think experience with v3.0 will be fundamentally different than with v2.9 and before.  Before, the only real usage patterns were blogging and simple brochure websites.  For that, stability was not nearly as important because relatively speaking very little custom development was bring done on the platform.

With 3.0 and custom post type I expect a huge amount of demand for custom development to support vertical market solutions (much like Drupal has benefitted from in the past 2-3 years), and that custom development will need more stable releases.

BTW, as I organize this conference[1] next week in Atlanta around business use of WordPress, pretty much all our presenters are echoing the same opinions (i.e. that businesses will en-masse commission custom functionality built around custom post types.)

OTOH, this might be a huge opportunity for 3rd party (or Automattic) to provide this level of support much like Acquia does for Drupal?

Its not what was added in 2.0 but what we did post 2.0 that was hard to backport.

http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/the-wordpress-2-0-x-legacy-branch-is-deprecated/

We added a lot of security enhancements post 2.0 and some of these were quite deep changes

Realistically the best way to help this happen is to keep an eye on security related changes which happen and work on backporting them.

This is the best way to make a LTS version viable.

Patches Welcome :-)

I agree, in principle. I don't like forcing people to choose between
security and a new, less time-tested version. There's no chance of LTS
like our 2.0 experiment (our goal was five years... it proved
impossible). But a "short-term-support" period with security-only
updates for the previous version is a possibility. There is less
chance of the fixes being difficult to port backwards, and it is
offered over a much shorter timeframe.

We haven't committed to doing that, but it's something I'm certainly
giving a lot of thought. It has to be presented in the right way, so
as to not discourage upgrading to the latest version, while still
offering more complicated WP rollouts a chance to be secure while they
get their plugins checked for compatibility.

I think what what might be missing here is the core commit team 
confirming, "if you submit security patches for an LTS branch, we'll 
commit them." Every time this topic comes up, the response basically 
boils down to "It's too much work in addition to moving forward with the 
main branch." I don't think that anyone (well, anyone reasonable) 
expects the core team to be the only people responsible for backporting 
security patches. But with what seems to be negative push-back on the 
idea, not many community members are going to willing to put forth the 
effort to work on patches for "unsupported" versions.

Like you say, it's a community effort. But for something like this, the 
community members who might be able to help out need some affirmation 
that their work can come to fruition. Two-way street, and all that. What 
if we established a core+community security team, perhaps on a private 
mailing list, as a start? Put out a volunteer call (privately, even -- 
cherry pick candidates if you want), gauge interest/participation 
levels, put out some procedural guidelines, etc.

Alex,
There is the 3rd annual WordCamp UK taking place next month (17th and 18th),
this year it is in Manchester. Details here http://uk.wordcamp.org/ I
believe a number of people from mainland Europe will be coming.

There are also several regional meetups/groups meeting more regularly (
http://wiki.wordcampuk.tonyscott.org.uk/WordPress_UK_locals), for instance I
run a monthly Manchester WordPress User Group (http://mwug.info/)

A lot of people use sites like meetup.com to organize smaller/more
frequent meetups in their local areas (me, here in San Francisco
included).

Users savvy enough to want/need an LTS version are also savvy enough to use
source control, I would think. Just make the branch available via SVN only.

The 2.9 SVN branch was treated to a few fixes after 2.9.2's release,
same for the 2.8 branch and 2.8.6's release. A few were hardening
patches, but none were major security issues, if I recall correctly.

I don't see an LTS version like 2.0.x ever happening again. If you're
looking for the current legacy branch to be maintained with backported
security fixes, I think we'd all be amenable to that as this is what
we have been doing, even though we haven't been driven by a formal
commitment yet to do so.

Patches always welcome. I don't think you'll ever see Peter or me
reject a valid one :-)

A big thumbs up for Meetup.com.  

I've organized a Web Entrepreneur meetup for 3+ years using Meetup.com.  It's great because you can let Meetup's website worry about marketing your group and RSVP logistics and you can instead just worry about venues and producing stellar events. 

I also recently blogged a "best practices" list for meetup organizers:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Database Maintenance and Canonical Plug-ins
Message-ID: <004901cb0e99$5ee45ac0$1cad1040$@com>

I'm one of the many people who use a shared hosting solution to house a
WordPress blog.  In my case, I'm running three sites off the same
installation of WordPress (previously using WP-Hive, but I'm going to try
transitioning to the multisite feature of WP 3.0).  The issue I'm facing is
that my databases have an upper size limit of 100MB.  Normally this wouldn't
be an issue, but I checked today and found out that across my three sites I
had built a 30MB database already.

 

I found a system called WP Optimize that allowed me to quickly purge my old
post revisions from the database (realistically, I'm not going to review
articles from last month) and I was able to pare things back down to a
manageable 6MB total.  That's 6MB for three sites - a 3-times-per-week blog,
a once-in-a-while-when-I'm-bored writing blog, and a semi-static
professional portfolio, all of which have about 3 years of content.  Not too
bad when you think about it.

 

My concern is with the huge bloating effect that post revisions and
extraneous tables (left over from long-since-removed plug-ins) seem to have
on the size of the database.  I can't say whether or not this has had any
impact on performance, but I guarantee it would have caused issues had I let
it grow much closer to the 100MB limit.

 

So I'm proposing we implement a canonical plug-in for database management.
I'm suggesting the plug-in route because, really, this only affects a subset
of WP users . most people never look to see how large their database is, and
many of them will never have a problem with outgrowing their host.  But for
serious developers and long-term bloggers it could be a useful feature.

 

I'm thinking of a system that would do the following:

1)      Track what options and tables are created by plug-ins on
installation.  If the plug-ins are deleted, start a timer (maybe 1 month,
but configurable) and remove these deprecated values after they've aged out.
This would catch plug-ins with authors who fail to build in clean uninstall
functions.  I've seen far too many (and been guilty of it myself) lazy
systems that set up huge data structures and abandon them on uninstall.

2)      If a post hasn't been revised for a significant period of time
(again, configurable) its revision history will either be deleted or
archived (moved out of the database and into a static text file . maybe
XML?).  A lot of us have massive amounts of unused storage space on our
servers, so storing 100MB of post revisions in a mostly empty 5GB file
system would be a lot more efficient than keeping them around cluttering the
limited-size database.  Since the post revisions aren't used heavily, I
doubt not having them indexed in the DB would be too big of an issue .
still, they're there if you ever want to go back and look.

 

Now that 3.0 is out and we're all taking some time to step back, stretch,
and look at the whole landscape, I think spending some time revamping the
way we maintain the database would be nice.  As an added bonus, we could
also build some kind of auto-backup into a maintenance plug-in . something
that works outside the regular WordPress framework, automatically backs up
the system at regular intervals, and can be called upon to automatically
roll things back if necessary.  Then, if a future upgrade goes poorly, or if
a new plug-in borks things, you can just go to
http://myblog.url/wp-admin/database_restore.php, log in as usual, and roll
everything back to your last restore point.

 

In any case, I'm trolling for ideas, input, and feedback here.  Is this
worth some serious design time?  Would this be appropriate for consideration
as a canonical plug-in?  What else would you add to make it a serviceable
system?

When I'm asked to review or test a plugin, or inspect it for suitability,
any plugin that leaves a mess behind will get very low marks. Unfortunately,
it'd be quite difficult to determine which options and tables came from
where. The only true solution here is to educate plugin developers to use
deactivation and uninstall hooks properly -- "Leave No Trace" is an
excellent mentality of any plugin or feature -- and do what it can to limit
the number of options and tables needed.

Our philosophy is plugin over core option, of course, and this seems like a
perfect candidate for a plugin.

Generally speaking, core plugins will come not only out of a need, but
proven demand. While I don't see it here, it could of course gain traction
over time.

Since we're taking some time off for wp.org updates... How about we
start an LTS tag or similar in trac now and see how it works? If it
gets enough traction, go with it. If not, don't. Like Peter said, it
has to be a community thing. If people are willing to backport and
submit patches, then tag them with LTS and roll with it.

3.0 may not be the greatest release to try this with, but given extra
time, it can't hurt.

Thought: Perhaps we can check for uninstall code and flag plugins as
being known to be uninstallable? Just an idea...

Absolutely in support of that, both in the repo and in core.

Something to consider: if WordPress.org/extend were evolved to have some new mechanisms it's possible that people in the community could augment plugins, i.e. maybe there's a plugin that is otherwise great with many users but maybe it doesn't clean up after itself. If there was a way to allow community members to associate plugins as options to an existing plugin maybe the community to solve some of these issues?

It would be nice if we could extrapolate on that idea and go beyond uninstall to include other attributes that can be derived from automated inspection of code, i.e. "has shortcodes", "has custom post types", "has taxonomies", etc.?  It would be really nice if we could drill down to find, for example, all the plugns that offer custom post types.  

Again, something to consider (and it sounds like post 3.0 is exactly the right time to consider such things?)

LTS generally defines "Long" in *years.* Ubuntu, for example. What is
on the table is something substantially shorter than most definitions
of "long," so we'd do well to avoid referring to it as "LTS" release.
I'd be happy to backport security patches one version (so, if 3.0
branch is current stable, backport to 2.9 branch), if there are no
objections from the other leads. If we are not offering these releases
via the one-click upgrader, there's not much that needs to be done.
Commit to the branch. Tag a new version. Push it out. It'll be
available via SVN and via the release archive only. We can soft launch
it (that is, not announce it), and see how it goes. If it is working
out, and isn't too much of a burden, then we can consider formally
committing to it. As noted, we've been doing some backporting already.
The only thing we're really missing is doing a version bump and a
package.

But, if some issues are important enough to justify a release,
shouldn?t we also tell people about it?

That is, either (1) announce the update to installations that are on
the same branch, or (2) have a mailing list in place that annnounces
all releases, major and minor.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugins and CSS - newbie question
Message-ID: <AANLkTilAEOxhc9HIW1C5jA_KFW-Jw4nzP79u0kPW0oh3@mail.gmail.com>

I'm planning to re-write a plugin I use and I want to include some CSS
with the plugin so I don't have to modify the theme CSS file. I did
some searches and I think I should use the call 'wp_print_styles' to
add the CSS ... but unfortunately I can't find any documentation of
this call.

Does anyone know where I can find this? (looking at the definition in
source code didn't help me much unfortunately)

(or should I do it some other way?)

Hey Jan,

Please use the WordPress support forums at
http://wordpress.org/support/ for support requests in the future, this
mailing list is for advanced development discussion (hacking) and
WordPress core discussion.

That said, the function you actually need is wp_enqueue_style. A quick
Google should bring up many examples for you.

Thanks for the suggestions Doug and rovo89, they're both more elegant
than removing and re-applying the filters.

It seems there's no way around the problem of nested calls to
preg_replace_callback() though, so I've had to drop the use of
get_the_excerpt() and use my own function (which is pretty much a
clone of get_the_excerpt() without the 'the_content' filter).

Hi Alex. WordPress meetups are generally informal local gatherings that 
tend to happen monthly in a given location. Though we are planning to 
bring planning functionality for these into wordpress.org soon, for now 
a lot of people use http://meetup.com to organize these kind of regular 
meetup groups.

WordCamps are annual gatherings that bring together more people, often 
from surrounding areas, and are organized via wordcamp.org. The WordCamp 
UK event that Mike Little linked to is the official event for this year. 
That said, places that have in past years had one all-encompassing event 
named for their country (or in the UK's case, their collection of 
countries) are finding that with the rapid growth of WordPress and 
people who want to grow their local communities, there are more 
WordCamps happening than ever. For example, there's WordCamp UK, but 
there was also a WordCamp Ireland this year. I would not be surprised to 
see a WordCamp London separate from a WordCamp Manchester at some point 
in the future (just as an example), let alone seeing breakout events in 
Scotland or Wales as those communities grow, so there are opportunities 
to get involved. The first step is to get involved with your local 
meetup group if there is one, and if there's not one, then start one. :)

Jose Fontainhas has also talked about organizing a "WordCamp Europe" 
that would be larger and bring together people of many countries and 
have a bit more focus on international issues, though that event has not 
been confirmed yet.

If you have any questions about setting up a meetup or WordCamp feel 
free to email me offlist at jane at wordcamp.org.

Like others I think your idea is okay but your solution is actually much
more specific to your needs than you think it is.

As far as revisions go I think they are the biggest issue with database size
in WordPress at the moment. Before they were added in core my databases
rarely got over 20mb but since their addition even moderately-sized sites
invariably skyrocket to over 100mb of database, making it near-impossible to
manage them with common tools like PHPMyAdmin and complicate all processes
related to backing up, migrating and maintaining development copies.

Personally I think everyone should be carefully considering how many
revisions they want to store for each post, rather than storing them all.
Usually the revision you want happened recently (due to some error on your
part or network error on the system's part), so you don't need that
revisions from 15 saves ago. There are plugins that limit the number but it
is much easier to use the constant:

        if (!defined('WP_POST_REVISIONS')) define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 5);

Everyone should add this in their wp-config.php, it makes a HUGE difference.


IMHO the number of revisions should be an option in the SETTINGS > WRITING
screen, and there should be a default that is not infinity.

+1 for backporting security patches by one version. This will let enterprise
sites have ~6months between mandatory upgrades instead of 3, which would
make a big difference, while also keeping it reasonable for the devs.

For the record there are so many good reasons why the 2.0 LTS experiment
failed that its IMHO not even worth considering it when contemplating future
attempts:

   - It was driven by the demands of Debian and not the
   community/developers. This alone probably doomed it.
   - 2.0 was probably the buggiest release of WP ever. It added a ton of new
   features that kind of worked but felt really strange. It had a full UI
   reworking without the user testing that went into subsequent UI overhauls.
   It was also the first use of the visual editor, and it was a nightmare that
   needed to be disabled immediately.
   - The plugin API was very immature at that point compared to everything
   since 2.5 or so.
   - Few enterprises (LTS customers) were using WP because compared to today
   it really was 'just a blog'. There were few CMS-y plugins and no big players
   (NYT) had committed to it yet.
   - WP SECURITY PROBLEMS DIDNT REALLY EXIST YET. This is probably the most
   important one. The large-scale WP exploits didn't start until around version
   2.2/2.3. That was when we all started freaking out about upgrades and
   demanding that all users upgrade on release day or be damned. By the time
   security became a big issue everyone had already moved on past 2.0,
   especially plugin and theme developers. Once we knew that versions and
   upgrading were issues we should pay attention to it was already too late for
   the 2.0 branch. The only "LTS" option was to build new sites using an almost
   completely dead branch of the software which also happened to be  buggy and
   wierd.

I was probably one of the few people who kept running 2.0.x for years on my
own personal site. I ended up getting hacked despite staying on top of the
releases, though I was mostly expecting it by the time it happened, since
there had been no new releases for so long.

Here's to a secure 3.0 (and 3.1 and 3.2)!

As far as I'm concerned 3.0 is the release that comes after the longest safe
period in the history of WP, I can't even remember when the last real
exploit wave happened that wasn't more than a release behind the current
one. I'm pretty sure 2.8.4 is still secure, a testament to all the work
that's been put into WP since 2.0 and those tragic dark ages of 2.3.x :D

What I think is kind if funny (humorous) is that people say things  
like that a lot, but if you look at the last couple of years, it's  
been 6 months between releases anyway. We keep saying we want to do  
three per year, but starting with 2.7, when I started, it's only been  
2 per year (every six months or so) anyway.

Not just 2.7: 1.5 (when WP really came of age with plugins and themes)
was released in 2005, and since then we've had 10 major releases.

Matt Mullenweg is one of those optimistic people: in the latest 3.0
release announcement, he predicts that we'll average about 4 releases
per year for the next two and a half years.

Thats because he's not the one who has to write all the code anymore! ;)
Maybe there would be 4 releases a year if his fingers were taping away day  
and night still :)

I used to think this was valid, hence the 2.0 LTS branch. Now, after 
working with hundreds of the largest companies and media properties in 
the world, I am philosophically opposed.

While I like the theory of LTS, what happens in practice is it covers up 
the incompetence of IT or developers because they put off small slightly 
painful upgrades until they get so out of date of trunk (3 years? 5 
years?) and you have to go through a giant, painful, screws everybody 
over upgrade.

At a deeper level, it's disrespectful to your users. A good example is 
WYSIWYG, which we improved dramatically in the releases following 2.0. I 
would run into businesses who were sticking on 2.0 because it was LTS 
but their users were HATING WordPress because "making the WYSIWYG not 
suck" wasn't backported as a security fix.

I would rather have them hating some other out-of-date CMS. I would 
rather the IT department do two hours of work every 3-4 months than a 
two-month death upgrade project every 5 years.

Not backporting is a conscious decision. I would rather invest 100 hours 
in backward compatibility in a new version than 2 hours in backporting a 
fix to an obsolete version of WordPress. Plus, as noted by everyone 
else, backporting was often impossible because it wasn't one or two line 
fixes, it was architecture changes that would touch dozens of files. The 
LTS was actually *less* stable with these "fixes" backported because it 
had almost no one using it. Why?

So if we had been able to stick to the 5 year cycle for 2.0, you would 
still be on something roughly like this version of WordPress:

http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.0.11.zip

Please download it. Install it (someplace private). Make a post. Edit a 
theme. Upload a photo gallery. Use a custom post type (oh wait). It 
sucks. It's embarrassing we used to promote this software. We've learned 
so much, gotten so much better, and we're going to continue to.

You don't even need to go that far back. Use 2.6 for a month. It's only 
about 2 years old.

The best thing we could do for the savvy people inside these big 
companies is to give them a scapegoat they could blame the constant 
upgrades on (those open source hippies! keep making new software.) all 
the while they know it's really best for their site and their users.

Plus, this is wp-hackers, we know upgrades aren't that bad. Half the 
people here run trunk. So does WP.com a good chunk of the year (and all 
the major sites hosted there).

As the wizards of WordPress, the question we should be asking isn't how 
do we trap people in the jail of old versions for years at a time, but 
rather how do we make upgrading as easy, safe, and painless as possible 
to the point where we could even start auto-upgrading.

This is not true -- if anything we had some real honkers in those days. 
Now it's pretty obscure stuff, then it was remote database privilege

Really good points Matt.

It's a shame to ask for LTS old software when upgrading WordPress has ended
up being a fun thing to do.

Fair point, that sentence shouldn't have been emphasized and wasn't
qualified enough. What I meant was that the *perception* of long-term
insecurity wasn't nearly as strong as it is today. Most people didn't feel
the problem until 2.0 was already out of date. If 2.5 had been an LTS
release I think the result would have been very different.

Hi everybody, 3.0 is great and everything. Nice to see post thumbnails!

I have this problem: I got a bunch of product images and I want to associate
"Price" and "Size" fields to them for easy display in galleries. My guts
tells me someone has already done this but I can't find any examples. Any
pointers?

You could do it with postmeta data, but if it was me, I'd do it with
custom taxonomies.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies

Either way you're looking at a custom plugin to add the data, and some
theme work to display it.

Yeah, but I think what we're* talking about here is more realistic. 
Maybe we should call it "STS" (Short-Term Support) instead of "LTS"? I 
don't think we have to make any commitment (official or otherwise) to 
support any particular release for years. But if we could just support 
the "current-minus-one" release up until the time that the 
"current-plus-one" version came out, it would provide a 
not-too-unreasonable window for those who hesitate to upgrade to the 
shiniest new version, for whatever reason.

For a pure feature release, like 3.0 (AFAIK there are still no known 
security holes in 2.9), it's not that big a deal. But if someone 
theoretically discovered a 3.0 security hole 3 months from now which 
also affected 2.9, I think it would behoove us to backport the patch 
into the 2.9 branch and do a point release, even if backporting the fix 
is a pain in the neck due to code refactoring.

The main thing here is that it would be nice to have "official" support 
from the core team, even if it's community members at-large who do the 
actual bugfix backporting. Yes, I'm sure that if this had occurred in 
the past, such patches would have been welcomed, but there has been no 
stated process around it. It would be nice if someone would actually say 
that such patches would be reviewed, and that there would be a "real" 
-minus-one update release.

Here's a possible pain-point:  if you are running 2.9.2, and there was a 
2.9.3 release while 3.0 is current, I'm assuming that the updater will 
only show you 3.0 as an upgrade path. I'm guessing this could be 
addressed with a plugin, though.

   * And when I say "we", I'm really only speaking for myself. :)

Whoops, I missed this message when I wrote my previous reply. This is 
pretty much right in line with what I was asking for (except for me 
wanting "real" releases on the -minus-one versions from the get-go). 
Thanks for ticking in on this, Mark. Like I said, I think that just like 
with the rest of WP, the at-large community devs will kick in on this, 
as well, especially if there is some level of commitment from the core team.

+1 for the idea of keeping the current-1 release up to date with security.
?There are several other open source systems on the market that already do this
(the best example is YUI). ?So long as we're making security/stability patches
to the 3.0 branch, we could still port them to the 2.9 branch. ?Once 3.1 comes
out, we can "officially" deprecate the 2.9 branch and just maintain the 3.0
branch with security patches.
?
It seems straight-forward to me. ?Am I missing anything here?

Exactly. Isn't there a plugin that can do this for me already?

We've discussed alot the idea of a Short-Term Support in the dev chats in months past and from what I can remember we have the following stumbling blocks:

 * What kind of UI do you offer to people?
 * What kind of fixes to you backport?
 * Who wants it?
 * How do plugins and themes fit in?

Now in general the consensus has been that the idea of providing security support for version-1 till version+1 is released sounds sane.

However, I'm starting to think that from a suckage point of view it starts to fight back.  It doesn't just add extra work for the core team of contributors is back porting security fixes, testing releases and getting them shipped but it adds a whole lot of extra work on theme/plugin authors - as soon as we step forward and say version-1 is supported for security fixes until version+1 is released we are now effectively saying to all the plugin/theme devs that you need to support both these versions in order to not get alot of grief from users who want to use them.

I'm also unsure how the upgrade paths would work for someone using this STS release.

Hypothetically let say we did the following:

Released a 2.9.3 tomorrow for people to upgrade to
Released a 3.0.1 in the future
Released 3.1

If someone is running 2.9.3 when we release 3.1 they now get pushed to which version - 3.0.1 a 6 month old release or 3.1?

It feels a bit like short term support sucks too as you just end up with more work for all the contributors and trying to support two different versions

Cheers

Subject: [wp-hackers] Customizing wp-admin
Message-ID: <4C1BB3B6.7020101@olumidealabi.com>

Hi Guys,
I'm trying to customize the admin backend in WordPress to make it look 
more like the custom theme I've built. I would be glad if I could get a 
few pointers as to what to do or links to any posts written on the subject.

I'm trying to not use any plugins unless they are absolutely necessary 
as this is the route I've gone with building the needed functionality 
into the theme's *functions.php* file.

I've also had some success with customizing the *wp-login.php* look and 
feel without using any plugins and/or making any modification in the 
core, that would break should there be an upgrade.

I'm running WordPress 3.0 Thelonius.

Thanks.

You know what? You haven't dealt with real IT professionals and decent
developers then.
9 times out of 10, it's not IT's fault -- it's idiotic "change
management" "controls" that require 15 forms of sign-off so that a
single install of something can be upgraded. Most halfway-decent
admins that I know and have interacted and, yes, worked with can
process an upgrade (particularly a well-written one) in a very decent
amount of time and, when upgrades go awry, will stick through to see
the upgrade to the end, regardless of the lateness of the hour.

So don't go the "blame IT!" route, thankyouverymuch.

END OF LINE.

You're looking for wp_enqueue_style:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_style

There's a few posts on the subject on Google. But that will let you
load a new stylesheet into the admin areas, and then you can style
away.

Otto Thanks,
Seen that and I've already been able to load up a custom style sheet. 
I've also figured out how to change the background color for the header 
and footer in the Admin Dashboard but the rest of it is kinda blurry.

Does a list exist anywhere with the IDs and Classes that I need to 
override in my custom stylesheet? That would be very helpful.

Thanks.

Jon,

I'm assuming you want two new fields to show on the Upload Media form and or the form under the Media nav. Simple enough. 

There are two actions you want to hook into 

attachment_fields_to_edit and attachment_fields_to_save

The first action lets you add fields to the media popup form. The second action gets called when the user saves the form. This will let you process the form fields and update the post meta or whatever. 

Do a search via Google to find some code examples. I wrote a plugin called Media-Tags which does this. 

P-

Use DOM Inpsector in Chrome or Firebug in Firefox to see what classes are
used on various admin screens. Much more practical than a static list of ids
and classes, IMO.

Subject: [wp-hackers] post management page empty if enablign custom taxonomy
Message-ID: <4C1BD385.1070308@maddler.net>

Hello,
I've just installed and playing around with Wp 3.0.

I'm trying to add custom taxonomy to make easier to handle different
post types on my own blog.

Everything seems to be working fine. I can add new taxonomies, edit them
and whatever. But if I move to the post management page no post is being
shown there, I get total for all, published end deleted posts, but no
post is being shown. Only posts being shown are those with custom
taxonomies assigned. Any clue? My fault?

I've added this ty my theme's functions.php

function ls_taxonomies() {
        register_taxonomy( 'post_type', 'post', array( 'hierarchical' =>
true, 'label' => 'Post Type', 'query_var' => true, 'rewrite' => true ) );
        add_action( 'init', 'build_taxonomies', 0 );
}

add_action( 'init', 'lstaxonomies', 0 );

Thank you

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP 3.0 and beyond: Custom post types + custom fields
Message-ID: <AANLkTik5JTp988nQxRdyhzUn0T5zMdhHRFdIMs8IhV1G@mail.gmail.com>

Now that the custom post type functionality has been refined with 3.0, one
important next step would be to more closely integrate post types with
custom fields.

There's no easy way -- using only core -- to assign certain custom fields to
a new post depending on its post type.

For example, a new "Soccer Team" post type. You'd likely want to see custom
fields like "wins", "losses", "home_field", and "roster" (some sort of
relationship) show up by default when adding a new Soccer Team.

The closest thing I could find was the "register_meta_box_cb" argument,
which lets you add new meta boxes -- not alter the "Custom Fields" area.

Here's a *really* rough idea of how this functionality could work:

$args = array(
    'public' => true,
    'publicly_queryable' => true,
    'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail', 'custom-fields'),
    'custom_fields' => array(
        'wins' => array('label' => __('Wins'), 'widget' => 'number'),
        'losses' => array('label' => __('Losses'), 'widget' => 'number',
'default' => 0),
        'home_field' => array('label' => __('Home Field'), 'widget' =>
'text-single')
    ),
    ... etc ...
);
register_post_type('soccer_team', $args);


Has any serious thought been given towards this aspect of WP? There are
several plugins out there that attempt to tackle this in various ways. I'm
curious as to if there's much interest in this making it into core, and if
so, what steps have been made thus far.

Matt

Yes, I'd seriously be happy to see such a function in WP core. As of now
I've been using custom fields but, you know, ain't that straight forward.

Being able to easily define custom posts an attributes would make
everything a LOT easier. IMHO

William

Indeed poorly implemented change management control can be a real pain.

This tends to get in the way of /any/ change though so I'm not sure that a security backport process would help.

I sometimes wonder if one of the blockers to upgrade for sites is where the site has been sold as a one of cost.

i.e. I will create you a site for X

The end-customer hasn't been pre-cultured to the need for an ongoing service of maintenance and upgrades to keep them secure and therefore they only upgrade in a panic once they have been hacked.

Yeah, for this I like to fuzz via Firebug. With extentions, you can even
find the unused CSS selectors:

I've been toying with the idea of a register_metadata_field function that
would allow you to register a custom field type much like you can custom
post types. I think it would be great to build out something like the
settings API where you can register settings, and setting sections, and
support standard input types (text, textarea, select, etc.) but also allow
custom rendering.

For anyone interested, I started writing out a method signature for the
function:

register_metadata_field('fieldName1', 'post-type', array(
    group = '' // To which meta_box the field should be added
    , field_type => 'text' // The type of field; possibly values: text,
checkbox, radio, select, image. 'custom' if display_callback is specified
    , label => '' // Label for the field
    , description => '' // Description of the field, displayed below the
input
    , value => array() // values for select, checkbox, radio buttons
    , display_callback => '' // function to render the field, if not using a
built-in type
    , save_callback => '' // function name for saving
    , client_validation_callback => '' // function name for client-side
validation
    , server_validation_callback => '' // function name for server-side
validation
    , show_in_columns => false // Add the field to the columns when viewing
all posts
    , add_to_edit => false // Add the field to the Edit page
    , add_to_quick_edit => false // Add the field to Quick edit
) );

It might be overkill for core (at this point, at least) but anyone want to
join forces to make this happen as a plugin?

William,

Maybe you should have this:

instead of this?

> add_action( 'init', 'lstaxonomies', 0 );

I haven't looked at the rest to verify but it certainly won't work as presented in the email...

You mean a "one-off" cost? Sometimes that's the issue. Other times,
it's bureaucracy run amok, with endless meetings that are little more
than territorial scrambles by self-interested parties, the insane
diktats of which line engineers and IT admins will have to make a show
of implementing lest the entire thing be shown to be a giant sinkhole
of time, money and serotonin and which results in little more than
security kabuki theater.

Hi Matt,

I've got huge respect for you and your accomplishments in building the community that you have. And it's in large part to your instinct and idealism.  So kudos.

OTOH I think that philosophy is at least a tad unrealistic.  But knowing you and knowing the community I'm not going to challenge your position.  It is what it is and what it will be.  Still I would like to bring up a concern I have that could minimize issues if the core committers could take certain criteria into consideration when deciding upon which patches have higher priority than others.

======
The primary concern is lack of apparent priority given to patches that can potentially make existing plugins more robust to potential future changes made in core.
======

With custom post types more companies (especially agencies) are likely to be building custom vertical functionality on top of WordPress. I'm in Atlanta and we have over 100 agencies that build websites for clients, and many of them do it for the 11 local Fortune 500 companies.  These agencies and others are going to be commissioned to build enhancements to WordPress on projects with a fixed budget and they are going to do it in whatever way they can that minimizes their time spent and their effort required. After the site is deployed there will be a skeleton budget for maintenance, but not enough of a budget to rebuild functionality broken by changes made between versions of core.

When a new version of WordPress comes out and someone upgrades it's often possible that a major corporation's site will be broken. Fingers get pointed every which direction and there is no budget to pay the agency to fix it.  And head's roll when that happens.

What I'm describing actually happened for a site I built for a company whose name everyone on this list would recognize. The site broke after I was out of the picture but the agency (who was my client) told me all about it.  It got ugly for them.  What happened?  I had to hack NextGen Gallery because it's database wasn't relational and simply could not do what the client required. I forked it so it wouldn't automatically upgrade. But a forced security upgrade of WordPress caused the forked NextGen to break because of a hack that NextGen had used which required my client to use the new version of NextGen which lost my modifications. All in all I think they had to eat over $5000 in billing to correct the problem. 

Think that agency will ever chose WordPress again? Think that large company will ever let WordPress be used again? I can promise you the answer is no, at least not as long as anyone involved on the project has anything to say about it. (It also means I get no more work from that agency since I only work on WordPress at this point.)

So the negative upshot is that either agencies or clients says "Never again will we EVER allow a site to be built on WordPress."  Clearly we wouldn't want that happening often, right?

Again, I know Matt you are going push everyone to upgrade and we just have to accept that.  But one of the problems is that developers need to write hacks to parts of WordPress to make custom plugins do what their clients want and those hacks make the plugins fragile to improvements in the core. Then developers (like me) request mods to core to protect against future changes but those patches are often ignored or just punted to future versions.

As an example I'll present ticket #13694 [1].  It's not a perfect example nor it is a huge hot-button for me because it was simple and I could work around it but it is the best example of my concern which I can dredge up on short notice. On that ticket filosofo said "I don't think the public menus API should expose or depend on the fact that menus are actually taxonomy items" [2] for which I am in 100% agreement with.  He suggested a simple patch that would introduce a hook that would have allowed me to code my plugin so that it didn't depend on knowledge of the underlying storage of menus but Nacin punted that patch to a future version. So now I have to write my plugin to depend on the knowledge of how menus are stored[3] and it might break in the future. (I'm not 2nd guessing the decision to bypass 3.0 on this specific patch, just using it as the best example of the concern I have.)

======
So in summary, if priority could be given to patches that help future proof APIs just like priorities are given to security issues then much of these concerns would be rendered moot.
======

JMTCW, and thanks for considering.

-Mike
P.S. If priority is given to these types of patches and I just am not aware of it, please forgive me for voicing the concern.  I'm just trying to help...

[1] http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13694
[2] http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13694#comment:1
[3]  I have lots of other code now that I've recently written with the deep knowledge of how menus are stored because I couldn't make it work any other way and I'm afraid a future upgrade will break my client's plugin and he'll blame me for it breaking.

The general idea is definitely appropriate for core. It's an obvious and
common need, and when putting together a theme the functions.php file is an
obvious place to define custom fields that will be displayed in the theme.

I actually have something like this hacked together for myself that lets me
define an array in functions.php which then gets converted into a metabox
(hacked it off an old coffee2code plugin that no longer works). It is
incredibly useful and handy and I couldn't live without it. Having the same
functionality in core is a no-brainer.

Your proposed function is pretty intense, though most of it seems relevant.
Ideally it would be modeled on the Settings API and add_settings_field() but
those functions are a huge mess and dearly in need of some wp_parse_args(),
so I like your idea of balancing the mandatory info and overrides.

Not sure about the naming, here are some other ideas:

 add_metadata_field()
 add_post_meta_field()
 register_post_meta_field()
 add_custom_post_meta_field()

They get pretty long at the end there but I think its worth being specific.
"metadata" is a very general term in WP especially with the 'metadata api'
that can be used for any purpose. Specifying 'post' (as in 'post-type', not
as in post-type='post') will make it much clearer.

We'd probably also want something like:

 add_post_meta_section()

Which could be used to define a 'group' which would have its own metabox,
similar to add_settings_section().

The paste and formatting of your proposed function were all messed up in my
gmail so I'll repaste it below (also at http://pastie.org/1010807 ):

register_metadata_field('fieldName1', 'post-type', array(
    'group' => '', // To which meta_box the field should be added
    'field_type' => 'text', // The type of field; possibly values:
text,checkbox, radio, select, image. 'custom' if display_callback is
specified
    'label' => '', // Label for the field
    'description' => '', // Description of the field, displayed below the
input
    'value' => array(), // values for select, checkbox, radio buttons
    'display_callback' => '', // function to render the field, if not using
a built-in type
    'save_callback' => '', // function name for saving
    'client_validation_callback' => '', // function name for client-side
validation
    'server_validation_callback' => '', // function name for server-side
validation
    'show_in_columns' => false, // Add the field to the columns when viewing
all posts
    'add_to_edit' => false, // Add the field to the Edit page
    'add_to_quick_edit' => false // Add the field to Quick edit
) );

There already are several plugins in this area (albeit probably not
supporting custom post types yet):

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-field-template/

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/verve-meta-boxes/

I don't see any point in bundling this with Core.

I've used that and it's approach has a flavor that feels very different from the way the WordPress API is evolving.

Haven't tried that yet but will try it soon.

> I don't see any point in bundling this with Core.

Have to disagree there.  I can't think of something more appropriate for a next step past custom post types than being able to define the custom fields for a post type.  Of course if making it a "core plugin" is the approach, that'd be good too.

We'll probably continue to do that as convenient, it's just not 
something I want to promise. When it moves from something we might do to 
must do it creates a lot of trouble. Not all fixes are equal, for some 
of them the best advice might be "bite the bullet and go to 3.0."

Not in any way related to LTS, but I wish to address this. We have been
aiming to get 3.0 released for some time, and enhancements were getting
swift boots. In this case, filosofo linked to a filter added to 3.0 (not a
patch) which you found sufficient, and then found insufficient. Not that it
wouldn't enable you to do what you wanted to do, but because you didn't feel
it was efficient enough.

These are edge case enhancements that we cannot research and flesh out in
the matter of minutes, because that's the most amount of time I'd want to
devote to something like this at such a late stage in the release cycle.
Hence, I punted it and would do so again.

Sigh. I was explicitly trying not to point fingers at anyone, I even caveated my comments about that patch saying I wasn't 2nd guessing.  

I didn't have a great example so I used the only one I had. I was simply trying to call the question on patch/development priorities. The only types of patches/development that appear to have any significant priority over others are security-related. I was simply trying to suggest we consider some explicit priority for those things that can help plugin and theme authors write more future-looking robust code. That's all.  

More specifically I've run into a lot of concerns about future robustness related to code I've been writing recently because of rough edges in the available APIs but I've been reluctant to discuss the issues here or on trac (especially before 3.0) because I feared my comments might  be taken wrongly, much as my quoted comment above was taken...

I'm just trying to help.

@scribu

I would say a god reason to put this in core woudl be that the more
3rd party code you introduce into a website (especiialy unvestted
code) the more potential instabilities, potential exploits and
upgrading issues(what happens if the plugin stops being supported?).

You have to remember that nowadays many wordpress websites are now
being used at least in part as CM (as per Matt's recent speech) and
that most are not being maintained by professionals. Giving theme
developers an api for custom fields + custom post types would allow us
to keep the amount of software required to just 2 pieces. 1) Wordpress
and 2) the theme.

Plugins are one of the greatest things about wordpress, but they are
also where most of the breakage occurs (In my experience).

For corporate/mission critical websites plugins are an iffy solution at best.

Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the plugin api. I use it to do
all sorts of neat things with the themes I build. But I tend to build
the functionality into the theme rather than rely on a plugin (with a
few exceptions) as it makes it easier to maintain the site going
forward and doesn't make every upgrade a crap shoot.

Just my 2 cents.

That's not why I want to do it... and if we backport one version, we
wouldn't enable them to safely skip versions. If we stop doing
security backports for 2.9 when 3.1 is in beta, they have to upgrade
to 3.0.latest at that point. What I want to avoid is offering someone
a choice between x.(y-1).latest, which is insecure, and x.y (i.e.
x.y.0) which is potentially (and historically) less than stable. We've
done that before. That's a fundamentally crappy choice.

I completely agree with what Matt said in the other e-mail about
actual LTS releases. I'd fight hard against that, as  I was the one
twisted under the impossible task of keeping our 2.0 LTS experiment
going. And I don't want to enable people to stay on old versions for
long periods of time because of developer laziness. But I don't think
it's lazy for a developer to want to keep their clients on 2.9.x until
3.0 has been out for a bit, and more plugins have been updated. Many
people "wait for the x.y.1 release" as a matter of principle. We have
had situations in the past where a branch of WordPress goes from the
stable recommended version for everyone, to a completely deprecated
and insecure version, in an instant. Again, I don't want any sort of
long term support (we shouldn't support the old versions in Trac or in
the Support forms), or anything more than essential security
backports. I just want people who don't want to upgrade on day 1 to
have options if a security issue should present itself on day 2.

This should have little effect on most of our users, as I'm not
proposing we present this in any way in the WordPress interface ?
they'd still only have the option of updating to the latest and
greatest.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Codex and old versions of WordPress
Message-ID: <AANLkTinq80TwxunfAdofN_sSIXrUSn8Iw0Tc_oMbQnai@mail.gmail.com>

I'm not too sure if the hackers list is the right place for this, but
following on from the latest discussions about LTS, not supporting old
versions of WordPress, encouraging people to upgrade, etc, plus the
announcement that the core team are now planning to spend some time on
wp.org, documentation, etc, maybe it's time to remove all the sections from
the Codex referring to old versions of WordPress?

Sections such as these appear all over the place:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts#Parameters:_WordPress_2.5_And_Older

http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_pages#List_Sub-Pages (that
even has a section for versions prior to 2.0.1!)

The Codex is seen as official and therefore authoritative, so these give the
impression it's fine to still be running these old versions. Surely one way
of encouraging people to stay up to date is to remove such outdated content?

I would also propose removing the older versions from the "Select the
version of WordPress you are using" drop-down when you write a new post on
the support forums - currently it goes right back to 2.6.5.

Yeah, I think it should only go back to the "latest version - 1" (currently
2.9) at most.

I think we should keep the codex page about each release, or course, but
mark it as being for historical reference only.

This sounds reasonable.

The best place to discuss the codex is the wp-docs list - CC'd

That way you can interact with all the volunteers who write documentation but are not subscribed to wp-hackers

But, we'll have to do things the hard way or use a plugin because more

So, I'm guessing corporate sites don't use WP Super Cache (or any other
caching plugin) because it's a plugin, right?

I have a government client which runs 50+ WordPress websites (both inside and outside firewalls) and no plugins are allowed on the site, with no exceptions. This includes stripping internal update calls, pings etc. from the core before a site can be upgraded and I know from experience, big companies are the same.

Besides, everything WP Super Cache does can be easily done without a plugin :)

I've also worked with a company that doesn't like plugins at all. 
Caching can be done easily without a plugin so we didn't use it. I 
personally also dislike plugins on my sites so avoid them at all costs. 
If anything can be done easily without them that's how it's done.

If that's for performance concerns, just note that a significant amount of
core uses the Plugin API to hook into itself.

We're good. No commitment. If security issues pop up that are valid in the current - 1 branch, I'll backport if it is straightforward. But no promises. Devs and maintainers should be scrambling now (weeks ago, really) to get plugins and sites on 3.0.

That should resolve this thread for now.

I find that fascinating.  I would love to hear, for my benefit and the benefit of all on the list, what the specific concerns they have about using plugins and the rationale for not using them?  Maybe there are things we could improve/change that would resolve their concerns?

Are their reasons tangible or intangible?  For example, do they dislike plugins:

1.) Because admins can enable/disable them and thus potentially break the site?

2.) Because they believe plugins slow down a site?

3.) Because they feel that plugins are not as well tested nor as well "supported" as core WordPress?

4.) Are they concerned about plugins that don't clean up after themselves?

5.) Do they require Askimet *not* be used because it is bundled as a plugin and not as core?

6.) Would they have a different view of core plugins vs. other plugins?

7.) Will they have the same opinion 100% prohibition of plugins as plugins that support vertical market functionality emerge that are specific to their business cases?

8.) I wonder if they understand that almost all the same code for a plugin can be put in a theme and if they have any issues with the same code in the theme?

9.) Is there something else?

10.) Or is it all simply a knee-jerk reaction because they assume anything labeled "plugin" is bad?

I'm not at all debating their perspective but instead simply wanting to understand it.  By understanding it we as a community might be able to make the situation better for them and still achieve many of the goals of the WordPress community.

A thought:

Sometimes it might be useful, instead of completely deleting
instructions and howtos for older versions, to make a very short
synopsis and put in an Historical Notes section at the bottom of the
article.

EXAMPLE

Historical Note

Function foo_bar() [the function documented in the article] got the
blah blah functionality in WordPress v2.9.  Before that people used
elaborate hacks to achieve the same result.  You don?t need to use
such hacks anymore and it is recommended to avoid them.

END OF EXAMPLE

In this way, people that have used or read about the obsolete way of
doing things will know where things stand at present and where things
stood in the past, and, for example, will not think that they
themselves, or the advice they have been following up to now, are just
stupid. :-D

Mike, in the case of our government clients it's a security concern. Their servers house sensitive data, the intranets we run using WP include politically sensitive, often classified  materials. You're correct any code in a plugin could also be in a theme but those themes are tested and approved prior to installation, whereas plugins code slip past during updates.  The threat doesn't even have to be large, a plugin that simply turning on the RSS or pingomatic feature on one of these sites would be enough to destroy careers.

The rest of the time, I think it's almost always the visual that I hear complaints about. Often (and I've been guilty of this) when a plugin is added, it creates menus in the wrong places, or adds menus without really needing to. If we could simply 'hide' the plugin (which is what I do when I copy it into the functions.php file) and turn off future updates (or at least the warnings), that would solve a lot of the problems for less technical end users.

Very helpful, thanks.  

Does this mean that if there were a *core* (aka "canonical"[1]) plugin that, for example, offered an image management API, or an base event calendar plugin they would feel the same?

And what about plugins that offer business-specific custom post type functionality? For example, what about a plugin that adds a custom post type of "courts" or "police precincts" or "voting districts" or "representatives?"  Would they not use those? What if they were commercially supported?

Just trying to fully understand...

In my isolated case yes, they'd still refuse the upgrade because it hasn't been vetted by their IT team but overall, I think having official vs. unofficial plugins would be great. 

Throw an iStore type payment option for plugins on there (WP collects the money, sends it out to developers) and I think you just made my year :)

Thanks Guys,
Will just have to fire up Firefox then. The Chrome DOM Inspector is what 
has got me this far but I think Firebug is just the ticket.

Been putting that off because Firefox somehow manages to slow my Mac 
Book Pro down but not as much as Safari does, which I find rather odd.

We should NOT remove the documentation for the earlier versions. There may
be some people running installations of wordpress which simply cannot be
upgraded. Although it is in the users' best interest to upgrade we should
not be so cold as to remove documentation for the earlier versions and make
their lives unnecessarily difficult.

Wiki's have histories.

It should be possible to remove outdated information from the codex and  
instead, link to a "This page as-of WordPress 2.5" etc possibly?

You cant include information on every tiny difference between every single  
version of WordPress on the page, it just becomes long and cluttered.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Math Comment Spam Protection plugin 2.2 doesn't work
	with WP 3.0...
Message-ID: <4C1E0E43.2050300@optimiced.com>

...but it was working perfectly with WP 2.9.2 and lower (down to WP 
2.0.5, when I first tested the plugin).

(My first post here, I hope it's the right place...)

Link:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/math-comment-spam-protection/

I am trying to investigate the issue, since I rely on this plugin for 
quite a long time -- more than 3 years -- and I have it installed in 
quite a few blogs.

But my PHP-fu is not so strong, so I am not sure what changed in the 
core of WordPress in 3.0 (especially the part that is related to posting 
of comments).

I am not the developer of the plugin, I am just using it. I even made my 
own modified version (not posted anywhere, for now, sorry), that made 
the plugin compatible with WP Super Cache!

Up to 2.9.2, the plugin worked perfectly with WP, but since 3.0, 
spambots bypass the field with the spam question (they can leave it 
blank!), and post easly spam comments. AKISMET works, but it still 
allows spam into database... which I am trying to prevent.

Any idea, where should I search inside the code of the plugin and inside 
WordPress, so that I could fix the plugin and make it work with WP 3.0? 
I suppose, some core WP function, related to posting of comments, has 
changed in 3.0.

I'd happily then re-release the plugin to the WP community (since the 
original author no longer develops it), and since simple and effective 
anti-spam plugins are not so many... (Not sure, but looks like WP Spam 
Free is not working with 3.0, too. It was quite a simple plugin, too.)

Thanks for any help!


Cheers,
--Michel

Actually, no. You should report the problem in the support forum for that
plugin:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Retreive menu item permalink
Message-ID: <AANLkTik83u4C1l7jZSKqd6H7fHjrXLx0Q0ADpF7DvC30@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working on a plugin that uses custom posts to manage a list a
feature "menu item". For each created item I can set an image, a text
and the menu item that it points to. When saved I record the menu item
ID.

I can display my featured custom post on the home page but I am having
trouble retriving a menu item permlink using its ID (I mean the
permalink the menu item points too)

- get_permalink($post->ID) fails
- I have tried wp_setup_nav_menu_item( get_post($post->ID)) witch fails too

Any thought?

Regards

Hi Lox,

Sounds like you've worked on something very similar to something I worked on recently.  Based on your description though I'm not sure how you are relating your custom post type to your menu item?  In my case I created a custom field in postmeta for the custom post type and stored the menu ID in it for the post of post type "nav_menu_item."  Is that how you did it, or something else?  Maybe a little more specific details of what you are trying to accomplish would help us help you?

-Mike

Concept is simple. A custom post type is called "Featured page". For
each I can add a title, a descriptive text, a secondary title, the
feature image, and the menu item to point to, on click. This last part
is done with two combo boxes, first u choose the menu in first one
then the second one get populated with the selected menu's items using
ajax. There u select the menu item. Both menu id and menu item are
stored for each "features page" custom post.

I then retreive them on home page and animate them using javascript.
When I retreive them, I make use of wordpress loop.

So the problem is to retreive a menu_item url from a menu_item's ID. I
can do it looping throught menu_items but I find that looping this way
for every "feature page" is ressource consuming:

function fp_get_menu_item ($menuId, $itemId) {
	
    $menu = wp_get_nav_menu_object( $menuId );

    if ( $menu && ! is_wp_error($menu) && !isset($menu_items) )
        $menu_items = wp_get_nav_menu_items( $menu->term_id );
    else return false;

    foreach ($menu_items as $item) {
    	echo $item->ID . ' '. $itemId; echo "\n";
    	if($item->ID === (int)$itemId) return $item;
    }
    return false;
}

Mmh well. It seems it was my bad.

Giving the fact that a menu_item is stored in featured-pages-menuItem
meta, this will give its url:

$item = wp_setup_nav_menu_item( get_post( get_post_meta($post->ID,
'featured-pages-menuItem',true) )));
echo $item->url;

Message-ID: <AANLkTiljY1F5quKMkYQzY5tEGm6Y_HB_U-pjXsx0pX1O@mail.gmail.com>

HI

I am currently building a site for a client where access to the blog
is restricted to paid members.

I am wrapping the loop in an if statement testing for user capability:
if ( current_user_can( 'custom_capability'  ) ) {

And this does not work

but when I do it for role:
if ( current_user_can( 'custom_role'  ) ) {

It does.

Is there something I am missing or is this a bug? According to my
understanding of the documentation it should take role or capability
equally.

Thanks!

Ash

Both should work, I'd be triple checking that the capability is actually  
being applied to the role.

Throw this in there beforehand:

$role = get_role('custom_role');
var_dump($role->capabilities);

As I mentioned (I think I did), the Math Comment Spam Protection plugin 
is no longer developed by the original author. There is no point in 
posting here:
   http://wordpress.org/tags/math-comment-spam-protection
because the author will never answer support questions. :(

So I was trying to understand myself, what was the core change in WP 
2.9.2 > 3.0 that made this simple plugin 100% un-usable.

Any hints into the right direction will be greatly appreciated! (Where 
should I look in the WP code and in the code of the plugin?)

This plugin worked fine for many years, and was perfectly OK with WP 2.0 
till 2.9. It doesn't work only in 3.0.

Stephen Rider suggested to me to try Quiz plugin instead 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/quiz/) which I am currently doing. 
But still, I'd like to see if the Math Spam Protection plugin could be 
fixed and perhaps re-released for WP 3.0 and above...

Thanks again!

Cheers,
--Michel

Hi Dion, Thanks

I have created a role called 'singleseat' with capability 'canread'

I added the check you told me and it shows the capability being added
( string(7) "canread" ). Also when I check the wp_options table the
role with capability is added.

But when I add a capability check:  current_user_can('canread') in the
loop it does not work. If I add a role check:
current_user_can('singleseat') it does.

I am using the Kubrick default theme on 2.9.2 (client doesn't want to
move to 3.0 yet)

What about this? I realise it may seem basic, i'm just trying to figure  
out where the cause could be in this case.

global $current_user;
var_dump($current_user->allcaps, $current_user->roles);

only a fast view from me; i think its a problem with the  $user_ID in the
plugin, this var is in WP3.0 0, not isset.
i attached a version with small changes, please test it.

the plugin, this var is in WP3.0 0, not isset.
i attached a version with small changes, please test it.


Hi, Frank,

Thanks for the hint!

Unfortunately, I do not see an attachment here -- are attachments to 
messages automatically removed from the list (or I don't see it)? Can 
you post the php file/code somewhere, with a link? Many thanks!! :)

Cheers,

Hi Dion, no worries about basic, I am still a learner :)

Here is the output:

array(2) { [0]=> string(7) "canread" ["singleseat"]=> string(1) "1" }
array(1) { [0]=> string(10) "singleseat" }

Thanks for looking at this.

Scribu I'm bummed to hear you asking a leading question like that. I think
its clear that most sites will have some kind of sliding scale of importance
v. risk that they use to decide which plugins are worth it. Core WP needs to
assess each need and decide whether its fit for inclusion in core. Implying
that everything should be a plugin because some things have to be plugins is
not a good way to deal with feature requests.

Also: Super Cache, as has been constantly debated and pointed out, is a
particularly poignant example of functionality that by all rights
*should*be included in core but which isn't because it's too complex
and
server-dependent to be appropriate. Lots of people want caching in WP but
when faced with the realities and complexities we all agree that it should
stay plugins to save everyone extra headaches.

Compared to caching this proposal for a non-UI API for registering custom
fields is a perfect example of some functionality that should be carefully
considered for inclusion in core because its so simple, obvious and
appropriate. Not only would many theme and custom-plugin developers use the
functions in their implementations but public-plugin developers could use
the new API in their GUI plugins, standardizing the process and making those
plugins more future-proof than ever.

Unlike caching there aren't many good reasons to avoid this idea. Do you
know of any?

IMHO pointing out that there are already plugins that accomplish something
is not a reason not to put it in core, it is a reason to consider it even
harder! If the test for inclusion in core is "Are there already popular
plugins that do this job, proving that there is user desire?" then a custom
fields API is something that has had enough proof of its value since WP 1.5.

Subject: [wp-hackers] new menu management 3.0
Message-ID: <AANLkTindC-jsvdUuQ7vhmSMQSB9EdFfeV0HjE9DiZ6Ob@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am playing around with 3.0 and the new menu system. I love it but I
have noticed it doesn't play well with the existing menu management
features.

Forgive me if this has been brought up before. On the page editor
screen if you select a parent page from the drop down this is not
respected by the new menus interface and vice versa. I understand why
(what with categories and custom post types etc), but shouldn't the
old ways of managing the menus be hidden if the new way is activated?
Maybe something that happens when a theme is activated that declares
support for the new menu system?

I can just imagine users banging their heads against the wall trying
to edit the menu from the page editor. Telling them, 'oh I know those
controls are still there, but they don't work, use the other instead'
isn't going to cut it. Its opening the door for unnecessary confusion.

Even better I think would be if some way could be found to handle menu
management *both* on the page editor screen and using the new
interface. It makes sense from a usability viewpoint that you would be
able to assign the page to a menu and a location within that menu when
creating the page without having to go to a separate interface to do
it. But it also makes sense to be able to edit menus en masse from one
location.  I think if we can have the ideal solution we need both
options.

Just my 2 cents please don't flame!

Great point, Ash!  I completely agree with all the points you raise, and
would like to add one of my own, though mine is really more of a feature
request.

It would be great if you could set the top level pages for a menu, and then
tell it to automatically drill-down through child pages as well, rather than
having to manually create the entire multi-tiered menu structure and then
also maintain that.  Also, it's slightly misleading that the default
behaviour for Twenty Ten if you add pages but no menu, is to fallback to
wp_page_menu and output a nice multi-tiered menu... but then when you create
a menu of top-level pages only, this automatic behaviour disappears.  Like
Ash said, I understand why, I just think it's counter-intuitive.

At the moment, while I applaud the effort that has gone into menus for WP
3.0, I wouldn't consider them to be production-ready and there's a lot of
work left to be done.

Cheers,
Japh

as far as i can make out, presently the menu is static and completely
separate from the general logic of the site. all other features work
as is. this helps in making custom menus and IMHO it would be cool to
have intelligent menu features like the ones u stated but we should
not treat it like a bug but as an enhancement...

I don't think anyone is trying to say that these are bugs. The menu system,
as is, works perfectly.

However, parts of it are a bit unintuitive, especially when considering
training a client.

I agree with Japh that if I setup a top-level menu it would be nice to *have
the option* to tell the menu to auto-populate the children (and keep them
updated when a new child is created).
The user could still go to the menu page and use the nice drag and drop
interface to remove or add items... but the basic structure would be
populated automatically.

Again, I don't think these are bugs, but I do agree that whilst the efforts
of the WP team on the menu system are awesome, and that it is perfect for
smaller custom menus, when it comes to the main navigation on a large
page-heavy site, it currently doesn't cut the mustard in terms of features
and intuitiveness.

At the end of the day, we sell Wordpress to our clients because it's
easy-to-use, because they don't have to do things manually, so I'm going to
continue using wp_list_pages, and the PageMash and Page Links Manager
plugins to manage main navigation.

Just my 2p

Sounds like a pretty trivial plugin to write prior to when (and if) such improvements can be made to the core.

Best place for these suggestions, btw, are as tickets on http://core.trac.wordpress.org/

I think at the moment we're all just commenting on and sharing our
experience of using the new Menu system in practice.

I'm pretty sure that once there is a solid idea of what (and whether)
features are needed a plugin or patch will be found from somewhere, but it's
early days yet :)

I'm sure it's something obvious on my behalf, but do any of you know why
as of Wordpress 3.0, in Page Templates, you can no longer call
"the_content()" without being in the loop, or calling "the_post()"
first?

Strangely, I can still call other functions such as the_title() with no
problem. Seems a strange behaviour, as surely on a single page, there
isn't really anything to "loop" through.

"the_content() is a Loop-specific template function.  You should not
expect to be able to use it outside the Loop.

You don't have to "loop," per se, just call "the_post()" to set up the
current Loop object properties.  Perhaps the_post() should be called
prior to including singular templates, as you suggest, but if
something similar happened in the past it was undocumented behavior.

someone interested? i can make a github repo for this and we can make
a plugin "smart menu" later, if the core dev feel so we can add that
to the core :)

Sorry, didn't mean it to come across as dismissive.  

Let me restate; if you discuss it on a trac ticket it will capture the discussion in the place where the core devs will review it and queue it, and will make it more likely that it will get addressed in core sooner than later.  

JMTCW anyway.

My biggest concerns about using plugins are:

1. Not cleaning out the DB if they're uninstalled. Most plugins don't do 
this in my experience. The should be some sort of API call to allow the 
user to download a .zip of the data then clean out the DB of the dead 
information.

2. Doing way more than I need. Many plugins try to catch all of the edge 
cases so introduce way more functionality than I need.

3. Future support. If we look at the last WP upgrade to 3 last week the 
Podcast TSG plugin broke a number of sites (including mine). WordPress 
3.0 was out to test for quite a while yet the plugin didn't get updated 
in time for the launch. Yes it was quickly fixed, and yes I should have 
tested it first before upgrading, but I'd rather have WP at the newest 
and find a new solution for podcasting.

4. Many things/features are easy to add as a theme option so don't 
require a plugin. Take switching out a Feedburner RSS feed for the 
normal RSS feed. It's trivial to add a text box as a theme option and 
have it overwrite the normal WP RSS feed.

For the company I used to work for the biggest issue was #3. If it's 
code written in house then in theory we can fix/test it easily if there 
is an issue instead of being reliant on a 3rd party to fix the issue. 
Yeah I can dig into the plugin and see about fixing it myself but it's 
not my code so it will take me longer to do it. There also is really not 
a good way for users to submit patches to plugins. I have contributed to 
a few Open Source projects through Github which has a pretty slick/easy 
model for forking and offering patches.

Akismet is a fine plugin to use because it comes bundled with the 
software. This puts it at a different level than other plugins. I do 
think that core plugins would be also put on a different level than 3rd 
party plugins (and this is what people are afraid of).

I've never worked where there has been a 100% ban on plugins. As someone 
else said it's a sliding scale. I use Google XML sitemaps, wp-db-backup, 
and one or two others without any thoughts of writing the functionality 
again.

To improve plugins I'd love to see a 'checklist' that rates a plugin. 
I'd expect to see easily if a plugin totally cleans up after itself, 
will backup the data it introduced...It would also be great for WP to 
check to see if plugins are noted as version compatible before you 
upgrade and warn you which plugins are not compatible.

Summarizing what I've read so far:

Plugins are for hobbyists. Serious sites don't trust them.

Themes are ok, because [unlike plugins?!] their code can be reviewed.

Yeah that's probably pretty close. Like I said if there was a more 
robust system for plugins to get into the repository or a checklist that 
plugins had to match up against I believe that some of the issues would 
not be present.

So let's put together a checklist. ?Quite a few plug-in developers follow this
mailing list, so if we build a checklist and mark it as complete (perhaps even
add a page to the plug-in development section of the codex?) then it gives us
the foundation for a standard.
?
So far you've covered a few points:
1) Clean install/uninstall (document what options and db tables are created -
remove both on uninstall).
2) Version compatibility (the WP site already has a framework in place for this,
but it's not as explicit as many of us would like - maybe set a few standard
tests and checks to verify it works with each version? ?Like a documented list
of which WP functions the plug-in depends on which can easily be compared to the
list of out-dated/deprecated/unsupported functions in core).
?
Some things I'd like to see are explicit guarantees of support. ?When is the
plug-in released? ?Who is the individual responsible for coordinating support if
something breaks? ?How long does the author intend to support the plug-in?
?There are people still using a plug-in I wrote years ago that I've stated many
times I no longer support (the functionality it provides is now a part of core
and redundant), but I still get the occasional "X broke when I did Y" email.
?
If we put together a standard, then it's a quick matter for plug-in authors to
say "My plug-in meets the ---- standard as of 6/21/2010" and offer that
additional level of comfort for end-users. ?It also makes it easy to audit that
statement if, for example, an author failed to actually test against a new
release.

?

There should also be an easy mechanism of transferring plugin 
ownership/responsibility to a new person. I know this has been discussed 
in previous threads so...

There should be a way for you to remove a plugin from the repo as well. 
As you've stated people bug you about a plugin that you haven't 
supported in years. If it's still in the repo I'd ask why? It really 
should be removed and it should be easy for a plugin author to remove it.

On top of clean uninstall it should offer to give you a downloadable 
.zip of the data before deletion. If you're removing it I'm guessing you 
don't need it but having it as a standard option is a good idea IMO.

With version compatibility I think WP should recognize if a plugin is 
not listed as 3.0 (or whatever) compatible and warn you of that.

Hey Curtis,

Your list was great.  I've had exactly the same issues, especially #2.  I figure "core" plugins will likely be more APIs than end-user features and that would work nicely.

Sounds like #3 would not be an issue with "core" plugins, since they would be tested to work prior to release.

As for non-core plugins and #3 I'm wondering if it would be viable for WordPress.org to form a volunteer team of plugin testers that could "certify" plugins to be compatible (yes, it would only happen for ~10% of plugins, but those would likely be the most used 10%.)  Add to that the ability to "chain" optional plugins that augment a given plugin and then the community to identify and fix incompatible plugins.

Automattic could even potentially offer a service to companies where the companies register the plugins their websites use and pay an annual fee to have those plugins maintained.  The fee could be a sliding scale depending on which plugins they needed maintained. With the revenue Automattic could then hire people to work on the plugins that nobody works on on a volunteer basis.

Just some thoughts...

-Mike

Just to address the feature request here. I think it's perfectly valid, and
I'm bummed we couldn't get it into 3.0. We did get auto-add top pages in,
because the UX and UI was straightforward.

However, dealing with the UX and UI surrounding auto-adding children was
more difficult, and after lengthy conversations (and attempted patches) with
some of the other devs, we just couldn't nail down what would be appropriate
functionality in order to make it happen in time. (I won't get into it here
unless someone wants to here it, but it is much more complicated than you'd
think.) We keep saying menus are just v1. We would definitely accept this
feature request for consideration for v2 of menus, and I'm pretty sure
there's already a ticket for it.

While building the menus system, I've seen various statements of "I guess
I'll just end up using other plugins and wp_list_pages/wp_page_menu then".
In some instances, they were legitimate weaknesses and we adjusted. But
often, wp_list_pages is far more suitable for the use case being described
anyway. ErinDS points out she will continue to use it and some plugins for
some clients, and that's perfectly valid.

This is something I lamented about early on, and I fully understand
why it didn't make it into 3.0. Still, it's something that I think is
necessary for menus to be usable for more than trivial cases.

What I'd really like to see though is more generic than that. I'd like
what constitutes a "menu item" to be pluggable. Because of the design
of the menu items, menus basically consist of a static name and URL,
stored in a custom post type. This is a pretty strange way of thinking
about menus, it seems to be, because it doesn't allow plugins to
easily create their own callbacks to produce more than just a simple
menu item. It doesn't allow for a way to easily create new menu
"types", as it were.

Unfortunately, after looking over the code, I see no easy fix for
this. The menu system seems to make that implicit assumption that a
menu item is a static thing. If you want menus that dynamically adjust
to the content of the system, using the new menu system is simply a
poor fit. You just have to stick with wp_list_pages.

I just tried it and it worked for me. If you want to submit a bug 
report, you might want to do it on Trac, under wordpress.org component. 
make sure you include your platform, browser, etc.

Thanks, I reinstalled it on the updates page and now it works. It said it
was up to date, so I hit "reinstall automatically". That is one thing to
remember for people with problems that no one can replicate.

I'm sure I've just missed the conversation, but is it possible with the new
Custom Post Type API to override existing post types? Or would there be a
better way to strip out a lot of the extra stuff (meta, revisions, ect) from
the UI for users?

I am working on a plugin that provides just that for the new menu
system. I have been able to have wordpress devs to add a custom filter
in the last days before official release to make this possible.
It is a work in progress so espect some bugs (fixes are welcomed) and
some texts in french ....

You can just re-register the 'post' post type, overwriting the arguments
found in create_initial_post_types() in wp-includes/post.php

If you want an excerpt on pages then install my Page Excerpt plugin.

Search for pjw page excerpt ( on iPhone so don't have a link to hand)

Subject: [wp-hackers] fetch_feed fatal memory error
Message-ID: <AANLkTikTi2krH7vdAjSJ7TGcrQpCCVWrX7r3BjCGR77J@mail.gmail.com>

If you put too large of a feed into the function fetch_feed() a memory
error will occur, flushing everything in the buffer, and WP will exit
with a fatal error. Parsing any large XML document like this as a
document tree has a tendency to run into memory allocation errors, RSS
being no exception.

Increasing the WP_MEMORY_LIMIT fixes the problem, but ideally,
shouldn't the feed be buffered away from WP, so that whoever controls
the provider end of the feed doesn't have the power to cripple your
blog?

The example warning given when wp_debug is true:

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to
allocate 1158121 bytes) in /home/www/public_html/wp-includes/wp-db.php
?on line 478

I thought of submitting this as a bug ticket, but I've never done that
before. Would this qualify?

Yep, that should do it.  

But be prepared to test some edge cases where it doesn't behave as you'd expect, and maybe even find bugs because I doubt "post" nor "page" were tested with anything other than that standard values.  

If you do find issues, of course, please report on trac...

To add excerpt, this does the trick:

register_post_type( 'page', array(
		'public' => true,
		'_builtin' => true, /* internal use only. don't use this when
registering your own post type. */
		'_edit_link' => 'post.php?post=%d', /* internal use only. don't use
this when registering your own post type. */
		'capability_type' => 'page',
		'hierarchical' => true,
		'rewrite' => false,
		'query_var' => false,
		'supports' => array( 'title', 'editor', 'author', 'thumbnail',
'excerpt', 'page-attributes', 'custom-fields', 'comments', 'revisions'
),
		) );

Don't re-register the post type. There's a proper way to do this that is
more forwards compatible:

add_post_type_support( 'page', 'excerpt' );

Just make sure you attach that to the init hook.

What about removing support?

Ideally, when re-registering a post type, register_post_type() should merge
the new arguments with the existing ones. That would allow maximum
flexibility, with minimum code duplication.

Andrew,

Can I use that function to override/remove features that are already in Post
and Page? Or only add features?

Just for clarity, when I said "trivial" I meant for someone to address their own needs and ignore edge cases, not to address the needs of the entire user base.  As you stated, the latter is far from trivial.

Citing an exception does not disprove the rule. Citing one example out
of 10,000 as a means of disregarding my statement isn't just poor
debating skills, its irrational. I thought this was a place for
discussion. Or is it only a place for discussion when that discussion
doesn't challenge your views?

I would have thought we all have the right to be heard and voice our
opinions without our opinions being subjected to sarcasm and
belittling.

nuff said - onto the meat of the debate:

>

Nope that's not it at all.

Let me try to explain what I am saying.

1) What type of WordPress user am I referring to?

I am referring to corporate, government/ 'mission critical' sites
where unpredictable behavior or site breakage is *not* an option.
These sites don't tend to use off the shelf themes, they either hire
someone to build them one from scratch or hire someone to modify one
for them.

Like it or not WordPress has outgrown it's usage as *just* a blogging
platform. More sites today are built as CMS then blogs today. Along
with this growth has come a change in the WordPress userbase. Its not
just for hobbyist bloggers anymore. Now it's used in all sorts of
environments by people who are not qualified to detect one good plugin
amongst the 1000's available.

I am not saying most plugins are bad, not at all. I am saying that the
average end user is not equipped to tell between the good and the bad.
In such circumstances blanket assumptions get made. Corporate and
government clients have neither the inclination nor the resources to
become experts. So the end result: plugins = bad is the assumption
most arrive at after a few breakage experiences. Like it or not, right
or not the baby with the bathwater approach is the way these types of
clients think. They just don't get the 'case by case' mentality
required to use plugins.

Like it or not, the average user of WordPress today has no idea what
constitutes a good plugin and what doesn't. Many of them even think
the current "it works/it's broken' rating system in the repo is
'official' and provides some kind of guarantee.

9 out of 10 times a WordPress site breaks (in my experience) it's due
to a plugin either being poorly written or with conflicting javascript
libraries of other plugins.

2) What do I think about plugins?

Plugins are brilliant, they are a part of WordPress that makes it
great. They are a tremendous resource for innovation, experimentation,
education and community involvement.

However, because of this, when plugins are taken as a whole, they are
unreliable and not 'corporate ready'.

Yes there are exceptions, but I'll bet if you take 10 developers and
ask them to cite 10 plugins they would recommend to their corporate
clients as stable/reliable plugins (regardless of function) all 10
would have a different list. Even we developers cannot always agree
what plugins are reliable. (Note: I am discussing reliability NOT
usefulness)

3) So what's the problem exactly?

Plugins can introduce script conflicts, site breakage, security holes,
and unpredictable behavior. None of this is acceptable within a
corporate or government website.

Yes, so can themes. But the users I am referring to have *paid*
someone a lot of money to build a theme. They are not downloading and
installing themes from the repository.

This segment of the WordPress user base is quite large and growing
larger everyday.

Plugins also suffer from abandonment. For whatever reason, be it lack
of time, other interests or what have you plugins can, at any time, be
abandoned. The average end user does not know how to edit code or
manage a plugin themselves. Nor do they expect to have to.

The end result is suddenly a  core feature of your site stops working
because the developer stopped developing it.

4) What exactly am I suggesting

Nothing new really. Nothing others haven't already suggested. Plugins
would probably be better labeled as 'community plugins' with a clearly
stated disclaimer indicating they are not, in any way, guaranteed. The
'it works/its broken' compatibility rating system needs to be clearly
marked as a community effort and not some sort of official stamp of
reliability as many end users assume it is. Yes a lot of end users do
think this, it's a commonly held assumption that I have to correct
with almost every client I deal with.

I think Core plugins are a good solution. When I said that support for
custom post types + custom feilds should be core and not a plugin, I
had not yet thought through all  of the implications of core plugins.
I have since had a couple of conversations about core plugins with
other readers of this list (you know who you are) and agree that core
plugins could be the solution.

Some functionality is commonplace enough and has high enough demand
that an official solution would be welcome. Assuming core plugins meet
the following criteria I think the corporate and government users
would be happy to use them:

1) Guaranteed by WordPress to work with WordPress
2) Guaranteed by WordPress to be well maintained and updated and *not*
subject to abandonment
3) Guaranteed by WordPress not to introduce security holes or
instabilities insofar as the WordPress software and other core plugins
are concerned.
4) Guaranteed by WordPress to be updated in tandem with WordPress so
that when a new version of WordPress is released core plugins are
guaranteed to continue working.

They key word here when talking about corporate or government users is
'official'. They are looking for official solutions, they do not trust
community efforts - yes we all know that that is how WordPress is
built, but *they* generally speaking don't know or understand that,
and as a rule, they shouldn't have to.

What should become a core plugin? I would say that's open to debate
(and hopefully rational debate). But at a start we could look at
plugins that have gained traction, that have become popular. Start
using community plugins as the test bed for new functionality.

They do not necessarily need to be bundled with WordPress. In fact, if
keeping WordPress light weight is a goal I could see some
functionality being taken out of core and rebuilt as a core plugin.
For example the featured image or new menu management system.

This could have the added benefit of allowing new functionality to be
added to WordPress outside of the normal release cycle while still
allowing that functionality to be 'trusted'. Not saying it's a good
idea to release things outside of the release cycle, just saying it's
a possibility.

Of course all of this is moot if the target market for WordPress is
developers only. But if WordPress is serious about spurring further
growth of its user base it's going to have to accept that the needs
and expectations of said users are changing and will continue to do
so.

Should core plugins be a replacement for community plugins? No!
Community plugins are a vital part of WordPress and I would never want
to see them removed. But there is no reason the two types of plugins
cannot and should not coexist.

What makes me qualified to hold an opinion on this?

1) I use WordPress
2) I 'own' WordPress, as do we all
3) I am able to think and formulate opinions
4) WordPress is meant to be about community involvement, I would
expect that to extend to this list as well.
5) I have been using WordPress for more than 5 years
6) I have been hacking WordPress, be it just for layouts or for
functionality for the last 4 years.
7) I develop with WordPress professionally and have done so for the
last 4 years, in fact, for the last two years my company has built
sites exclusively with WordPress, I actually turn away business that
is not WordPress
8) I have built, through my company, more than 50 sites on WordPress
in the last 2 years. My clients include everyone from a work at home
mother of 5, to government agencies, to all kinds of corporate clients
to SME's to 'Mom n Pop' businesses. All of them have had problems with
plugins. On average I get 3-4 emails a year per client of the 'Help my
site if broken variety'. In 90% of cases its down to a plugin they
recently installed or updated.

1+ for core plugins
u dnt need to make a huge speech man english would have done d trick too :P
i am learnin both drupal and wordpress together and what core plugins
seem to me is an attempt to have modules of drupal kinda thing added
to wp also. (its just a layman language remark) IMHO it would b nice
if we have that and can move the best plugins(in terms of reliability,
time between a new wp version being released and the plugin getting
updated, popularity n usability) to core plugins. will help everyone

Subject: [wp-hackers] Making use of The Loop in a shortcode function
Message-ID: <AANLkTimzgRIzsrJnlv8n3gjYNbQbZLwxDsq7AuFTjlnC@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using a Loop in a Wordpress shortcode function. Because it is
really nice ;) and because it allows me to make use of templates for
the shortcode output.

But because the content made by the shortcode function must be
returned and not printed with echo, I have to use output buffering:

public function shortcode_featured ($atts, $content, $code) {
		
    extract( shortcode_atts( array( 'cat' => 0, 'template' => '') , $atts ) );

    global $wp_query, $post;
		
    if(!preg_match('/^[a-z0-9\-_]+$/is',$template)) $template='';

    if(!$template) $template = 'Featured';
    $template .= '.php';

    // backup main loop
    $temp_query = clone $wp_query;

    // setup new loop
    $wp_query = new WP_Query('post_type=featured_pages&orderby=rand');
    setup_postdata($post);

    ob_start();
    // look for $template file in current theme directory
    if (file_exists(TEMPLATEPATH.'/'.$template) ) {
	    include (TEMPLATEPATH.'/'.$template);
    }
    // fallback to default template
    else {
	    include( GKNC_PATH . '/Templates/Featured.php' );
    }

    // restore main loop
    $wp_query = clone $temp_query;
    setup_postdata($post);

    return ob_get_clean();

Isn't their a better way to achieve it ? I find it really ugly....

Yes I did.

Hopefully I have managed to have a filter added in latest 3.0 RC to
make this possible (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13858)

That's pretty much it for PHP5, AFAIK.

In php4 you'd just assign it.  

A code sample from a legacy theme:
$temp = $wp_query; 
$wp_query = null;
$wp_query = new WP_Query();
[..]
$wp_query = null;
$wp_query = $temp;

The old school object shuffle.

I've never thought of using it in a shortcode though... nifty.

It seems to me that that would also be undesirable. Working with single.php
and page.php is complicated because you often want to assume that it is one
big loop for the individual post being managed, but that is an assumption
that WP should not make.

It is very possible that other posts, from custom queries etc, may be shown
inside a single.php or page.php screen before the main content, the result
of making the entire template a loop would be awkward and unpredictable in
this scenario.

If anything the bug is that the in-loop functions work outside the loop at
all. If they failed more consistently it would help avoid the confusion
caused by things like the_title working but not the content. I think
the_title() probably works because it is more likely to be used in the
header and other situations, so at some point it was given special powers to
inspect the singular title that the_content wasn't given.

Ok, here's something that strikes me as a bit odd, but maybe there's a
reason for it?

add_post_type_support allows the second argument to be an array of features
to be removed. remove_post_type_support does not. Is there a reason for
this, or just an oversight?

 Just a limitation when it was written. It'd be an easy patch if you want to

Subject: [wp-hackers] Running the WordPress test suite with PHPUnit
Message-ID: <AANLkTinETkquqCzBQEvKkKkw_a-EkSqdSYsuK56wBzLa@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone ever gotten the wordpress test suite (
svn.automattic.com/wordpress-tests/) to run using PHPUnit from the command
line, instead of running "php wp-test.php"?

I would like to integrate testing into a continuous integration environment,
and I am having trouble translating wp-test.php into a PHPUnit bootstrap
file. I would like to run the Wordpress test suite like this:

phpunit --bootstrap bootstrap.php --log-junit phpunit.xml
wp-testcase/test_actions.php

I created a bootstrap.php file that is heavily based on wp-test.php, and I
when I run it, I get this error:

Fatal error: Call to undefined method stdClass::set_prefix() in
C:\wamp\www\wordpress\trunk\src\wp-settings.php on line 286

Line 286 of wp-settings.php is this:

$prefix = $wpdb->set_prefix($table_prefix); // set up global tables

It appears that $wpdb is not being defined properly by this point in the
execution of the bootstrap.php file, but when I run "php wp-test.php", which
is almost the same execution steps, it works. It leads me to believe that
there is some issue with the way PHPUnit bootstrap files handle all of
WordPress' global variables, like $wpdb.

Another alternative for me would be to get the "php wp-test.php" to spit out
junit style xml files, which would probably be sufficient for me right now.
I have been unable to get it to work so far.

Anyways, someone on the IRC channel suggested I ask the wp-hackers list. Any
help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Dave Morris

I assume the output to XML would just mean changing the PHPUnitPrinter  
class we use.

I'll try and have a look tonight.

I have a feeling that running the test suite like this, is resulting in  
WordPress being included within a function..

The WordPress files expect that they're being included into global scope,  
As a result, you'll get errors like that if you run it in a local scope..

I've seen some people recomend adding somethign such this to your  
wp-config.php file to simulate it being included in global scope:

foreach ( $GLOBALS as $key => $var )  $$key = &$var;

Dion, I tried the $GLOBALS suggestion in my bootstrap and my wp-config file,
and neither seemed to work. I still get the same error.

Peter, I will look into switching out the result printer in the wp-test.php
file to the junit one.

Thanks for your help,

Dave

Hi Arlen. If you would look back through the trac tickets and dev chats, 
you would see all these issues were discussed and are targeted for the 
next revision of the menus feature, vs trying to do it all in v1.

By menu order of the pages and then title order.

Filter "nav_menu_meta_box_object" and change the _default_query
property (see the _wp_nav_menu_meta_box_object function in
wp-admin/includes/nav-menu.php for default behavior).

I'm trying to built a multi-level menu with wp_nav_menu and I need to style
the parent menu with children a little bit differently form the rest. Any
luck that will be fixed soon? Shall I fire a ticket for that?

Kindly,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Sidebar widget HTML/DOM
Message-ID: <7CCD2DD5-681A-4463-8B15-0B24C86AEDE1@g8o.net>

Hello all,

right now, register_sidebar() provides a few options to make additions to the HTML in widgets through the args ?before_widget?, ?after_widget?, ?before_title?, ?after_title?. However, this does not give me a good way to style the contents of the widgets (in a theme). One possibility is to use ?after_title? and ?after_widget? to wrap the content in a DIV, but that?s not always reliable, since some widgets do not have titles.

Currently I have a hack in jQuery to handle the special case of non-titled widgets, but its a hack and I am not happy with it. I am poring over the action/filter hooks to see if I can use one of them to modify widget HTML. But I figured I would ask the WP gurus here: any suggestions on how to go about this business?

Regards,

	?ravi

Message-ID: <AANLkTilxVN4QS0MVC0idXF7ARlRUkhSQ9PixR_cr3QMY@mail.gmail.com>

Question asked at WPMU-Dev with no solution.

Is there a way to add static links to a logged in members profile settings
as widget? The site runs WPMU+BuddyPpress MU and I'd like to have links that
point to:

http://domain/members/MEMBERNAME/activity
http://domain/members/MEMBERNAME/settings
http://domain/members/MEMBERNAME/social-media
etc

I'm no good at writing plugins so I'm hoping for some ideas or direction on
whether it can be done. Therefore any responses appreciated.

Instead of cloning and retaining the original values of the current
post as well as  wp_query it might be better to simply create a local
instance of wp_query and not overwrite the global instance.

This would require directly accessing wp_query's methods from your
local instance and not using the template tags, etc. that wordpress
provides, but might be better in terms of not missing any globals that
get over-written.

wp-includes/query.php might be helpful to see what I mean.

Yeah you have to grab a plugin that let's you run PHP inside a widget. There is one but I'm on my iPhone. Then use the is logged in conditional around the links.

Tried the PHP Code Widget
Entered the following:

<?php echo bp_loggedin_user_domain() . '/settings/'; ?>

also tried:

<?php
echo bp_loggedin_user_domain() . '/settings/';
echo bp_loggedin_user_domain() . '/activity/';
echo bp_loggedin_user_domain() . '/social-media/';
?>

No luck as the widget only displays the URL as:
http://domain/members/membername/settings

I usually use a Plugin called Exec-PHP for that.  Maybe that's the one you
mean?

FYI, the jQuery hack I have is to first use ?before_title? to add an <h2> element with class=?widgettitle? to each element that has a title. This gives me something like this in the sidebar (using the Pages widget as an example):

<div class=?widget ?.? ?.>
	<h2 class=?widgettitle? ?.>Pages</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> ? page1 ? </li>
		<li> ? page2 ? </li>
	</ul>
</div>

Since I want to wrap the UL (in this example) in a DIV so I can style it (make it collapsible, actually, in my case), here?s what I do in jQuery:

   jQuery('.widgettitle').each(
       function()
       {
           jQuery(this).nextAll().wrapAll('<div class="widgetcontent" />?);
       }
   );

This works for me, for now, but it would still be nice to be able to wrap it explicitly/deterministically in PHP, so if anyone has any ideas, including filters/actions that would accomplish this on the server end, please do let me know.

The PHP Code Widget is slightly safer, as it doesn't allow PHP code to
work from anywhere. This is something to consider if you have a
multi-user site.

What are you trying to do in CSS that can't be accomplished with the current
widget markup?

Why do you need to wrap it in a div? It's directly addressable with
jQuery(".widget ul") if you want to do it that way.

Scribu,

I am trying to make the widget contents collapsible, with hide/show triggered by clicking on the title.

Otto, I am not sure each widget will have a UL. For e.g the text widget does not, I think. This may be the case for custom/plug-in inserted widgets as well.

Ok, I see. With the way widgets work currently, I think jQuery is your best
bet.

Fair enough. You can use after_title and after_widget to wrap the
contents of the widget in a div. That's the best way, although as you
pointed out, it's not 100% reliable.

The thing is, the widget itself controls what its contents are,
completely. Before and after widget will always be displayed, but
whether the widget displays the before and after title bits is really
entirely up to the widget. So there's no 100% way to do what you're
asking, since you can't control what the contents of the widget are.

If you want to include extra (and potentially unnecessary) HTML markup
instead of going the fully jQuery route:

before_widget - <div class="widget-notitle-content-container">
before_title - </div><h4>
after_title - </h4><div class="widget-content-container">
after_widget - </div>

I however would recommend using JavaScript, considering you are after all
looking to implement a JavaScript effect with show/hide of content on title
click. But I wanted to show how this could be done more reliably.

If you're coding this collapsible widgets stuff for one specific
theme, then that will work since you can decide what the markup will
be.  You could probably also get away without any extra markup by
using some jQuery sibling, child and not selectors.

If you want this to be a plugin that works with any theme (is that the
goal?), you can't change the markup like that.

And since the markup is controlled by the theme, it'd be hard to find
a pure JS solution that works universally (unless you attach something
to the register_sidebar hook to detect the markup the theme is using).

Below is a little plugin that wraps divs around all widgets in all
themes.  It'll probably break styling for some themes, but that's
unavoidable if you want to add markup to widgets.

Maybe add in a CSS rule: .widget-content-container-no-title:empty {
display: none; }

In case this doesn't come through via email: http://pastebin.com/PvJfR9eh

function widget_wrap_register_sidebar( $sidebar ) {
        // Here's what we want: a wrapper div just around the content,
not around the title.
        $sidebar['after_title'] .= '<div class="widget-content-container">';
        $sidebar['after_widget'] = "</div>{$sidebar['after_widget']}";

        // But if a widget is titleless, the above will result in an
unpaired </div>
        // So we do the next two lines to ensure we always have valid HTML
        $sidebar['before_widget'] .= '<div
class="widget-content-container-no-title">';
        $sidebar['before_title'] = "</div>{$sidebar['before_title']}";

        remove_action( 'register_sidebar', 'widget_wrap_register_sidebar' );
        register_sidebar( $sidebar );
        add_action( 'register_sidebar', 'widget_wrap_register_sidebar' );
}

add_action( 'register_sidebar', 'widget_wrap_register_sidebar' );

Ah, that?s brilliant. (I would expand on that, for my needs, to add another wrapper div in ?before_widget? and a corresponding closing div in ?after-widget? so I can style the widget itself).

What makes me queasy with my jQuery ?hack?, is that DOM manipulation of this sort ? not triggered by some user action ? is IMO a poor substitute for generating the HTML the right way at the server end. Call it a [dubious] philosophical preference!

Ah yes. I realise that [now!]. I think I can live with that, for my theme. If there?s no title, specifically so marked, you don?t get the fancy collapse/expand effect. Such is life! ;-)

Michael [Adams]: yes, this is for a specific theme, but I am glad you posted the generic solution as well.

Thank you to all for the responses.

Message-ID: <AANLkTil9SpdmyzU2b5ruuYO-LgX1kMlDyAxiUoTrQCwx@mail.gmail.com>

I ran into this same issue while designing a fluid-width site. In order to
keep the width and and padding balanced in all widgets, as well as achieve a
consistent style that  I wanted (specifically a colored box around all
widget content but not their headings) I needed a div around the content
only but not the title. I needed it both because of situations where you
need a double-div to simplify browser-compatible floating/padding/width and
because adding the special color style to each different kind of widget is a
nightmare that causes massive CSS bloat compared to adding it to a standard
widget content container (in my case <div class="widget-contents">), which
makes it just one definition that covers all widgets regardless of their
content.

Here is the sidebar definition for the record (I think this is what ravi was
talking about in his initial question):

    register_sidebar(array(
        'name'=>'Sidebar Promo',
        'id' => 'sidebar_promo',
        'description' => 'Sidebar widgets shown on all pages. TEXT WIDGETS
MUST HAVE TITLES!!!',
        'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
        'after_widget' =>
"</div><!--.widget-contents-->\n</div><!--.div-->",
        'before_title' => "<h2 class='widgettitle'>",
        'after_title' => "</h2>\n<div class='widget-contents'>\n"
    ));

As Ravi implied, this is a house of cards. It depends on all widgets using
the before_title and after_title html as well as having a title in the first
place. If a title is missing then the whole sidebar falls apart and ruins
the page because the after_widget closes an extra div.

In my case I found this to be an acceptable tradeoff. Except for the text
widget all core widgets have a title no matter what. If you don't supply one
a default is used. I haven't run into any 3rd party widgets that don't
behave in essentially the same way, though I'm sure they are out there, and
I am more of a code-it-myself kind of person for widgets anyway.

In coding my own widgets for this theme I've found that it's easy enough to
ensure that they all have a default title as well, and that any widgets
where a default title makes no sense can be set up specifically to deal with
that scenario/markup -- I do this by adding an optional $args parameter that
inserts html to match the sidebar definition above, again not a particularly
perfect solution but it achieves the final output I desire and because its a
switch the default widget still works well without it. Personally I think
.widget-contents is a generically useful class like .widget and like .widget
i've started using it on parts of the site that aren't even widgetized, so
that they can match up with the sidebars that are.

In the end the biggest problem is the need to enforce a mandatory title on
text widgets. The theme I'm talking about is used on two dozen sites with
different admins controlling the widgets, so enforcing anything with
instructions instead of code isn't ideal. Luckily if they forget to add a
title the sidebar gets all fucked up, so they can tell they've done
something wrong. I also used instructions in the 'description' field for the
widget to declare that titles are mandatory (Don't forget your descriptions
guys, they are super useful!). So far only one of the sites has ended up
with a broken sidebar that the admin couldn't figure out themselves.

IMHO this implies that ideally the widget system should have had 6 optional
HTML parameters from the start, the two missing ones being 'before_content'
and 'after_content'. It seems to me that in many situations having a
containing div around the content, whether its a div, ul or a bunch of p's,
makes sense, and that many people would use that extra bit of formatting to
great effect.

I'm not sure if adding them now would make any sense though, since most
plugin-defined widgets would just completely ignore the new arguments and
nothing would be shown, so themers couldn't depend on it very much.

Actually, looking at the code now I'm seeing a filter on the title in text
widgets (default-widgets.php):

    $title = apply_filters( 'widget_title', empty($instance['title']) ? '' :
$instance['title'], $instance );

I don't have time to check it right now, but to me it looks like this could
almost definitely be used to filter the title of a text widget and make sure
there is SOMETHING there in all situations. If the title is empty you could
either insert a &nbsp; to fill space or a warning message like 'Dude you
need to add a title to this widget!', depending on your taste and the nature
of your theme. Either way having something there would set off the
before_title and after_title parameters of your sidebar and stop it from
breaking. I'll have to look into that for my theme at some point.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Post Type with contributor-like capabilities?
Message-ID: <4C250EB7.2090208@jakemgold.myfastmail.com>

  I'm attempting to create a custom post type "guest blogs" with a 
contributor-like custom role, "guest blogger".

When registering the custom post type, I pass a custom capability for 
"edit_posts" using the "capabilities" argument ("guest_blog"). The 
"guest blog" capability is added to the new custom "guest blogger" role, 
as well as a few other roles (like administrator).

The Guest Posts menu does show up for users with the custom role, as 
expected, along with the "Add New" sub menu item.

Clicking Add New successfully takes the "guest blogger" to the add new 
post page. As soon as the editor is focused, a warning that the user is 
not allowed to edit the post appears. Attempting to save a draft or 
submit for review results in a "not allowed to edit this post" error. To 
troubleshoot, I bumped the user up to Admin, and he was able to save a 
draft guest post. I then dialed the user back down to "guest blogger", 
and the user is not able to edit the post in the post list either.

I've tinkered with the other post type capabilities, including the 
"edit_post" (singular) which  - in theory - shouldn't need to be messed 
around with. Explicitly adding an "edit_post" capability to the role 
does actually let the user submit posts for review and edit his or her 
own posts - in addition to *all* user posts.

Seems like a bug in the custom post type functionality. Am I missing 
something? Before I start copying and pasting code, does anyone else 
have experience with this problem?

Didn't see anything obvious in Trac, but it can be tricky to search.

Hi hackers,

I have a rather big readme file for my JSON API plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/other_notes/) and I'm concerned that it's getting a bit unwieldy in its current form. As far as I know there's not a way to create hash links (#foo) in plugin readme files. Markdown doesn't seem to provide a way to made id attributes (see: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text which resorts to <h2 id="section">...</h2>) and I'm not sure what a reasonable syntax might look like. But I thought I'd float the general idea here and see if anyone else might find this useful.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <AANLkTimFB32IiKnxmPbq_9vvwmY7she0xe3FRB-_RFLr@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I'm adding a 'Questions' section on my site by adding a custom post type. So
far, so good:

    add_action('init', 'question_register');
    function question_register() {
    $args = array(
              'label' => __('Questions'),
              'singular_label' => __('Question'),
              'public' => true,
              'show_ui' => true,
              'capability_type' => 'question',
              'hierarchical' => false,
              'rewrite' => true,
              'supports' => array('title', 'comments', 'editor')
             );

        register_post_type( 'question' , $args );
    }

I'd like users to register and be able to post Questions, so I thought:

'capability_type' => 'question',

Therefore I created a user role and add those caps:

add_role( 'questions_writer', 'Questions Writer',
array('read,question,edit_question,publish_question,read_question,delete_question'));

read to see the dashboard + profile, everything else to read, edit, delete
the questions publish by him.

As I changed the code several times before getting the 'final' code I
thought adding:
global $wp_roles;
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'question' );
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'edit_question' );
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'edit_others_question' );
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'publish_question' );
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'read_question' );
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'read_private_question' );
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'delete_question' );
$wp_roles->add_cap( 'questions_writer', 'read' );

Problem: I can't get the Questions panel to be viewable by this user :'(

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Chocks

If you use a capability type like "gpost", which defaults to "post" then
WordPress will automatically generate the edit_gposts, publish_gposts,
delete_gposts (etc) capabilities for you. Additionally, it will know how to
properly handle the edit_gpost, publish_gpost, and delete_gpost meta
capabilities.

If you want finer grained control, you can individual name each of the
capabilities WP would otherwise generate for you based on the capability
type.

See register_post_type() and get_post_type_capabilities(), in
wp-includes/post.php.

  That (mostly) works... but that's not what I'm trying to do.

I'm trying to create an equivalent to post *contributors*, not authors 
(which I can do).

Are you able to create a new role that can submit "questions" for review 
via the admin, and can edit his / her own questions before publication, 
but can't edit others' questions or published questions?

Please see get_post_type_capabilities() in wp-includes/post.php to see how
capabilities get generated from the capability_type. You're missing the
plural aspect.

Also, don't give meta capabilities like edit_question to a role. Those get
re-mapped depending on context to the primitive capabilities, like
edit_questions, edit_published_questions, etc.

Deny them the publish_questions capability. In fact, the only capability
they should have (to be even with contributors) is the edit_questions
capability.

  I will experiment more with that, but let me flesh out my (I think 
legitimate) use case.

if ( !get_role('guestblogger') )
{
     $caps = get_role('subscriber')->capabilities;
     $caps = array_merge( $caps, array( 'guest_blog' => true ) );
     add_role( 'guestblogger', 'Guest Blogger', $caps );

    // add guest blogger capability to others
     $role = get_role( 'administrator' );
     $role->add_cap('guest_blog');
     $role = get_role( 'adminlite' );
     $role->add_cap('guest_blog');
     $role = get_role( 'editor' );
     $role->add_cap('guest_blog');
     $role = get_role( 'author' );
     $role->add_cap('guest_blog');
}

register_post_type( 'guest-blogs', array(
     'label' => 'Guest Posts',
     'singular_label' => 'Guest Blog Post',
     'description' => 'Guest blog posts from the members.',
     'public' => true,
     'capability_type' => 'post',
     'capabilities' => array( 'edit_posts' => 'guest_blog' ),
     'supports' => 
array('title','editor','comments','revisions','author','excerpt'),
     'menu_position' => 6
));

The idea here, anyhow, is that I don't want to add a bunch of new 
capabilities to administrators, editors, and authors (who should full 
access to guest posts). I want most of the new content type's 
capabilities to inherit those of "posts". In other words, if a role has 
the capability to "publish_posts", it should be able to publish "guest 
posts" (without a new capability). I /only/ want a unique capability for 
basic, contributor-like "edit_posts".

Perhaps I simply need to add unique, strictly named capabilities for 
'edit_post' and 'delete_post'? Or am I fundamentally missing something here?

Thanks for the input.

Jake

For your case, it looks like you only need to link to headings within
what the Plugins Directory displays as "Other Notes" (the URL you
linked: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/other_notes/ ).
Is that true or do you want to be able to link to arbitrary places
(not just headings)?

What if the plugins directory automatically generated id attributes
for the header elements (like MediaWiki does)?

So for your example:


See the [API Reference](#API Reference) section below for a complete
method listing.

== API Reference ==

The JSON API reference is split into four sections


Might turn into:


<p>See the <a href="#api-reference">API Reference</a> section below
for a complete method listing.</p>

<h3 id="api-reference">API Reference</h3>

<p>The JSON API reference is split into four sections:</p>


Or maybe even:


See the <#API Reference> section below for a complete method listing.

Which parser is used for the readme files?  If it is PHP Markdown
Extra, it already offers a way to add linkable ID attributes to
headings:

Message-ID: <003601cb1537$43e11480$cba33d80$@com>

I use WordPress to manage a web site for our swim team.  Users have to login
to register their children for swim team but once they've done that, many
don't login again until the next season.  I get a lot of requests for
assistance with passwords and password resets.  Recently I asked a couple of
the people who've had trouble to forward the password reset e-mail they
receive to me and what I am seeing is the link being broken across two
lines.

 

With a user base which isn't super technical, many people don't know how to
"fix" the URL, it is simply broken for them.

 

I am wondering if the Wordpress URL short link could be used for these
e-mails.  Is anyone aware of a plugin that already does this or any reason
why this won't work should  I choose to try and develop a plugin for it?

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

What if WordPress wrapped the URL in angle brackets (the less than and
greater than signs) before sending it?

I think all major mail clients understand the angle brackets convention.

Yeah, that's all I need it for. But I could see it being useful for the FAQ section, for those who have one.

That sounds like a perfect solution. I like that existing readmes would be covered -- no need to update.

I think the Markdown link syntax is sufficient, but this would be fine with me too.

Based on my experimentation, if a user had only the "edit_questions"
capability, they would be able to view the "Questions" admin page, as well
as the "Add Question" page. However, when entering a question on the "Add
Question" page, the auto save script would throw a "You are not allowed to
edit this post" error at the bottom of the edit box. When they click "Submit
for Review" WordPress dies showing the "You are not allowed to edit this
post" error.

Andrew, have you created a custom post type with a custom capability and
successfully been able to recreate a contributor role using just
"edit_{custom_post}"? I haven't been able to make it work.

Andrew, Jake,

Thanks for your comments. I'm not able to create the new role that can
submit questions for review.. I was able to send it via the front end using
the quickpress widget, that works great btw. Yet I'd like them to use the
admin.

Andrew, I've noticed that I was missing the plural aspect. You said "Also,
don't give meta capabilities like edit_question to a role. Those get
re-mapped depending on context to the primitive capabilities, like
edit_questions, edit_published_questions, etc." What do you mean by "those
get re-mapped to the primitive cap"? How can I tell WP to map que cap set on
the post type to that user and deny him the publish_questions cap?

Should I *just* set the new role the edit_questions capability?

Thank again!

In two hours Argentina vs Mexico so off to have a bbq!

I have been playing around with ways to streamline adding new post types to
my site and in doing so, discovered that you cannot pass any values to the
add_meta_boxes_ function call on line 877 of post.php. I tried increasing
the number of arguments, but I'm definitely messing in areas I am unfamiliar
with.

Before I go any further, I'm wondering what peoples' thoughts are about
expanding this functionality? Is it a good idea or bad? Trivial or
complicated? Just lameness? }8{D>

        add_action('add_meta_boxes_' . $post_type,
$args->register_meta_box_cb, 10, 1);

Are you sure you need absolutely need to pass arguments for that callback?

I mean, you already know the post type.

Well, here is what I am wanting to do: is like to be able to hold all the
info about a post type in an array - actual post type info and then meta box
info. The foreach through them, passing values to the register_meta_box_cb.
This works for everything but the meta boxes.

I found out that you can attach arbitrary info directly to the post type
object:

register_post_type('example', array(
  'foo' => array('bar')
));


... later ...


$foo = get_post_type_object('example')->foo;

didn't know about that one but could be useful - is it an intended behaviour
that i can safely start to make use of without fear it will cease to exist
in a future version, or just something that 'happens to work'?

Jake,

Based on your code I added:
'capabilities' => array( 'edit_post' => 'guest_question','edit_posts' =>
'guest_questions'),
And that allowed me to submit it for review.

I couldn't succeed to show the new post type on any other user than the
guest blogger.. does this bit helps what are you trying to achieve?

It may. Let me experiment. I think my confusion surrounds not fully 
understanding the way the singular "edit_post" and "delete_post" 
capabilities are handled on the back end.

As to your question, you need to add those new capabilities 
($role->add_cap) to the roles who should be able to edit those posts.

Evening all,

Just wondering if any of you kind ladies and gentleman has found a way to add a "first" class, to the first item of each submenu within a menu generated by wp_nav_menu.

Adding a class to the first ever li is easy (preg_replace on menu-item x1), adding it to the first li "under" each and every submenu UL has confused me, without going into stupidly complex preg_replaces.

E.g.   (look for the FIRST's) ::

<ul>
	<li class="menu-item">Home</li>
	<li class="menu-item">Page1
		<ul class="submenu">
			<li class="FIRST menu-item">Subpage 1</li>
			<li class="menu-item">Subpage 2</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="menu-item">Page3</li>
	<li class="menu-item">Page4
		<ul class="submenu">
			<li class="FIRST menu-item">Subpage 1</li>
			<li class="menu-item">Subpage 2</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

  This isn't right, Chocks.

And I'm now virtually certain - after trying a few other things - that 
granular / "special" capabilities on custom post types is broken in 3.0.

As to your code, Chocks, you can submit your posts for review. It still 
shows the "not allowed" error in the editor, though it does allow 
submission anyhow. Problem is every other "contributor" can edit your 
posts too. I think it's getting confused by the existence of the meta 
capability in the roles primitive capabilities.

I'm 99% certain WordPress should handle the meta capabilities (the 
"singulars") on its own (we should not have to assign those).

Here's some pretty basic code (from my functions file) that registers a 
new custom post type with a special (non-default) 'capability_type'. It 
is followed by some code that adds a new role with the plural 'edit_' 
capability (they still get errors trying to edit content or submit for 
review). That latter block of code also and adds every other custom 
plural capability to roles with similar (generic) post roles, yet 
administrators cannot edit others posts!

I can confirm that this code gives the "guestblogger" role 
"edit_guest_posts" capability, and that the 'guest-blogs'  content type 
has 'edit_guest_posts' as the value of its 'edit_posts' capability.

Andrew - I'd really like your opinion on whether there's something wrong 
with this code, and if not, whether the roles work as expected for you.


register_post_type('guest-blogs',array(
     'label' => 'Guest Posts',
     'singular_label' => 'Guest Blog Post',
     'description' => 'Guest blog posts from the members.',
     'public' => true,
     'capability_type' => 'guest_post',
     'supports' => 
array('title','editor','comments','revisions','author','excerpt')
));

// remove_role('guestblogger');

if ( !get_role('guestblogger') )
{
     global $wp_roles;
     if ( !isset( $wp_roles ) ) $wp_roles = new WP_Roles();

     $caps = $wp_roles->get_role('subscriber')->capabilities; //let's 
use the subscriber as the base  capabilities
     $wp_roles->add_role( 'guestblogger', 'Guest Blogger', $caps );
     $wp_roles->add_cap( 'guestblogger', 'edit_guest_posts' );

     // add guest blogger capability to others
     foreach ( $wp_roles->role_objects as $role ) :

         if ( in_array( 'edit_posts', $role->capabilities ) ) 
$role->add_cap( 'edit_guest_posts' );
         if ( in_array( 'publish_posts', $role->capabilities ) ) 
$role->add_cap( 'publish_guest_posts' );
         if ( in_array( 'edit_others_posts', $role->capabilities ) ) 
$role->add_cap( 'edit_others_guest_posts' );
         if ( in_array( 'read_private_posts', $role->capabilities ) ) 
$role->add_cap( 'read_private_guest_posts' );

     endforeach;
}

Hi Gavin,

There is the "nav_menu_css_class" filter hook which will allow you to do it but it will be a bit hackish. You are passed the existing CSS as well as the menu item but nothing that indicates the menu item's position.  You can access the items of the menu in the filter hook by retrieving them from the wp_get_nav_menu_items() function and then traversing the items to see if the item passed is "first" or not.  

If I were to do it I'd probably pre-process the list of items and create a global array keyed by item ids for only those that are "first." Then in the filter hook just use isset() on the indexed global array to determine if you should add "FIRST" to the CSS. (Of course, if you use the same menu items as submenus in multiple places it might be more difficult.)

Anyway, not elegant but except for the caveat it should probably get what you need.

HTH.

-Mike

Why would you need that? Just use "ul.sub-menu li:first-child". CSS2
has you covered on that score.

FYI, li:first-child doesn't work 100%[1] in IE8 nor at all in IE7, unfortunately.

Actually, according to your link, it does work in IE7 and up. The
caveats it mentions occur when you change the DOM via javascript.

Point taken. But for IE8:

"IE8 does the right thing only after you remove the focus from the test link."

Unless I misread, that's not related to DOM manipulation?  FWIW.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Leaving no trace in plugins
Message-ID: <4C28111D.10801@voceconnect.com>

I've seen a lot of discussions on the list mentioning to leave no trace 
when your plugin is deactivated by removing any options the plugin may 
have added to the options table.  The problem with doing this is that 
users may deactivate a plugin for reasons other than removing it 
permanently; ie, they may be doing an upgrade and disable all plugins to 
prevent conflicts that may occur.  When this is the case, removing all 
of the options your plugin may have saved will cause the user's 
preferences to be lost.  Here are a couple of options I see for this:


1.  Create a delete action hook for plugins to permanently remove 
options.  The issue with this, obviously, is that the plugin wouldn't be 
running register it's delete action.  There may be a solution to this.

2.  The second suggestion would be to use the autoload field of the 
options table to create a third status that would designate that the 
option is no longer used.  Options with this new status could even be 
cleaned out every so often.

Thoughts?

Message-ID: <AANLkTikzV11TIlwvBO3szFC1SQEETH5hCAjO986sHwzV@mail.gmail.com>

I'm setting up a video project using a three column theme called
videographEx which comes with two sidebars set at 170 each. Atop of the two
sidebars site an ad_sidebar.php file which allows you to add a 300x300 ad or
banner. What I'd like to do is at a 300x300 video. I've managed to locate a
slew of decent YouTube widget plugins but none seem to instruct on adding
the widget to the theme using the php code. In other words I can drag and
drop within WordPress but this looks like one instance where I'd like to
hard code the code for this particular template.
I'm mainly using YouTube plugins so if anyone knows of any way for me to
make this happen I'd greatly appreciate it!

Any responses applied.

If you use the uninstall.php file, then it's only run when the plugin
is actually uninstalled, not when it's deactivated.

Nope, it is. See their test page. They use a "test link" which adds
stuff to the DOM via Javascript.

If it's a more recent widget using the widget class, then you can use
the_widget function in the theme to display it as a template tag.

Example:

class Test_Widget extends WP_Widget {
... bunch of widget code ...
}

the_widget('Test_Widget'); will display the widget anywhere you like.
You can add an array of instance parameters as the second argument if
necessary.

I would much prefer if old plugins were officially "retired" or archived rather than being removed.  I have had situations where I've wanted to see an old plugin -- knowing it no longer worked, but wanting to see the original code for some reason.

For example, a coder built a web site for a company I worked with, and used a customized version on a plugin.  Later when I was trying to upgrade, I wanted to see what exactly he customized.  I could have done this easily if the original was still available for download, (diff folders), but it wasn't.  Really made things hard for me at the time....

To consolidate the other two responses:

There are two things already implemented, register_uninstall_hook() and uninstall.php.

The first hook registers code to run when a plugin is deleted (not deactivated) through the plugins page GUI.

Second, if your plugin directory contains an uninstall.php file, it will be loaded when your plugin is deleted.

Two different ways of doing the same thing, basically.

Some plugins do (incorrectly, IMO) remove their own data when deactivated, but this is not official best practice.

I think this policy should apply to themes as well which may add quite
a few options. As with plugins though there are a lot of reason a
theme may be deactivated. We also have to allow for those who
install/uninstall via FTP and not through the dashboard.

Some kind of 'leave no trace' button you can click before deactivating
 plugin or theme seems like a good solution. But given all the
different things a plugin/theme can do, is there a way to standardize
it enough to wrap in a  function that any theme/plugin could call?

Can themes also take advantage of the delete hook, via functions.php?

If so, I'll run this recommendation by the Theme Reviewers mail-list,
since we are currently updating/revising the general guidelines for
repository-hosted themes.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilGQ5062Arw31QQG7vETEmK6YwHO4GZVFFuZdLO@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am working on several custom fields based and a custom type post based
upon information from two sources which I indicated in the code @
http://wordpress.pastebin.com/TAL2C0DX . All custom fields *except* my
multipl checkboxes field - line 163 - 172 - are properly stored in the
database and returned in the Dashboard. Does anyone know how I can remedy
this? I have been added if for a long time now and am pretty much stuck. One
checkbox based on
http://sltaylor.co.uk/blog/control-your-own-wordpress-custom-fields/ code
works well, but my code two check several options to be stored does not.
FYI print_r lines were just added to print some data for testing.

Thanks in advance for any input you guys can give me.

Cheers,

Jasper

Jasper,

This sounds like something that belongs in the support forums (granted this
would be my first reply to this list, so that may be for others to decide).

I may have missed something looking at your code, however the problem looks
like the value you are using for your name attribute on the checkboxes.
To store multiple values, your name has to be in the format of
name="checkboxname[]" - the empty brackets let the processing script know
that it is
to accept an array of values, and not just an true/false value.

So, try putting a set of square brackets after the name of your checkbox
field and I'd assume you'll be good to go.

Define "flakey". See, I see a lot of this sort of response, but nobody
ever explains what they mean.

In my experience, :first-child and other CSS selectors work fine.

What's "flakey" is poorly conceived and implemented PHP hacks designed
to needlessly alter HTML in order to accomplish the same thing that
the selector can do just fine.

  Also never had an issue with first-child selector in IE7+, or any 
version in recent memory of the other browsers. I have seen a lot of 
HTML/CSS developers confuse what exactly this selector does, however.

Often times we let IE6 users "live with" losing the first-child selector 
styles. If its essential, I recommend using IE6 conditional JavaScript 
to apply the style (super easy with jquery if it's loaded anyways).

When a plugin goes to uninstall it should present the option to the user 
about removing options stored in the database. It would be great if it 
could offer the user a downloadable copy of those options as well just 
in case they want to use it again at a later date. It would be wonderful 
if WordPress had this built in so that plugin authors could just call 
the function to get the feature.

It would also be a great if themes could do the same thing.

Hi All,

I present you a very simple solution to this issue using jquery:

$('ul.sub-menu :first-child').addClass('first-child');


equally (but more specific):


$('.menu ul.sub-menu :first-child').addClass('first-child');



This will add the class first-child to all the matching first item.



Kind Regards,
Azizur Rahman

+1

This also helps with security reviews of a site with old plugins/themes.
 Being able to diff against the original version is much quicker than trying
to find any inserted code.

Hi all,

I'm building a social network with BuddyPress and WordPress, but I have a
special use case which I'd like some advice on. This isn't a BP specific
question though.

We need a database of 'members', but some will be offline (no need for a
login, possibly won't have an email address) and some will be online
(username/password). I'd like to build this on top of WordPress because all
of the other tools I'm building are WP plugins. There will also be different
'types' of members, which I will use custom user roles for.

I have a two options I think:

   - Custom post type for each 'member', and for online ones create an
   actual WP user in wp_users, assign that wp_user ID to a 'member' via post
   meta
   - Kind of hack wp_users with users who don't have an email address or
   password (auto generate a username?) - will WP allow me to do this, and is
   it best-practice?

Does anyone have any better ideas? I'm not totally happy these are the best.

Many thanks,

-- Alex  (Hempsworth)

Hmm... I don't think I get why you wouldn't just make them WordPress users
with random-generated passwords? If they don't have email addresses, you
could just create random_characters at yourdomain.com. Since you can create
members without having to send them verification emails, there's no need for
the email addresses to be legitimate unless you actually do want to bring
their memberships online at some point?

Either way, there must be some way to use the structure WP already has to
make whatever you are trying to do work.

They may need to be brought online at some point, but I guess we could
change the email address at a later date...

I'd say that, in a bubble, it's probably less hassle to stick to WP users if
you're going to be using WP users in the end.

You could certainly hack something in and use the WordPress user table and
user meta. However, if your full membership list is something totally
separate from your WP/BP list - I'd be tempted just to maintain it in a
seperate table with the specific columns you need.  I would assume that you
have data like mailing address, home address, phone number and etc that
isn't needed in WP/BP.  I think I'd keep all that separate and maybe have a
field for WordPress ID in that table.

It's hard to make a recommendation without knowing the situation better, but
that's my first thought.

Yes, each member will have quite a bit of meta (mailing address, telephone)
which I was going to have as usermeta, would it be unwise to do that? I keep
hearing that with the flexibility of WP core its inadvisable to create
tables, that you can achieve it all under the hood.

The first iteration of the membership database was a custom table, but that
was before we needed to have WP user accounts. Also, the usermeta system
built in is far more flexible if we need to add extra stuff in later...

It is certainly possible. I've done it both ways in the past and merged from
one to another.  The last version I did had the data in the WP tables as we
wanted to be able to display and edit the values in wpmu.  If you will want
this information within WP, that is certainly the way to go.  However, if
you are never going to touch the information at all in WP or use that as a
method to maintain it, you are probably building something more complex than
you need.

Maintenance is always a deciding factor.  So remember that you will have to
build a UI to edit the information that is not a default part of WP.  That's
not difficult, but it is a time consuming step that must be taken.  If you
don't get any benefit out of it, keeping everything in a single easily
editable flat table might be the best way to go.

That's something you'll need to decide.

You'll definitely have an easier time using the users and the usermeta
table. Why reinvent the wheel? You can use the
profile_personal_options action hook to add fields for people to put
in or change their data that is not part of the normal metadata.

You *could* use a custom table and then write your own authenticate
filter to allow people to login using it though, if you really had a
need to do that. However, for them to be "logged in", they'll still
need an entry in the users table.

Here's an example of using the authenticate filter:

add_filter('authenticate','custom_login_check',30,3);

function custom_login_check($user, $name, $pw) {
	if ( is_a($user, 'WP_User') ) { return $user; } // check if user is
already logged in
... do stuff here with $name and $pw to check which user id in the
users table it is ...
	$user = new WP_User($user_id);
	return $user;
}

I'm tempted to go the pure-WP way, it does seem like a lot of the work has
been done for me. I'll definitely need a custom UI for the options
pages, but I can also take a lot of stuff from the existing users.php,
user-new.php etc.

Thanks for all the continued discussion guys, really appreciate it.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikv3A0nEJR9QOhOMdjNaLrGJcdqHcVKvDP9f3lV@mail.gmail.com>

So I have a set of pages in my plugin which require the capability
'manage_finances' to be able to view. This works fine, if I give that
capability to the 'administrator' role I can see them fine.

I then created a custom role, with that very capability, like so:

add_role( 'treasurer', 'Treasurer', array('read', 'manage_finances') );

But when I assign that role to a test user, none of the admin panel is
accessible - not the dashboard, profile, let alone the page I specified. I
get this error:

You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page.


What could I be doing wrong?!

I have mentioned this issue (plugin/theme DB crud) in the past, but I wonder if all plugin/theme authors will be conscientious enough to clean up behind themselves even if provided the hooks to do so? Unless the plugin/theme review process includes such a check, I am pessimistic on that front. Perhaps the question has already been raised: why not have WP (core) enforce the option naming and carry out the clean up on theme delete (with a prompt to user)?

I agree with Otto that you *could* do the authentication out of the separate
table, but that can be a pain.  My main caution was that you shouldn't
combine two different concepts just because you can.  Just because something
CAN be linked into WordPress doesn't always mean it should be done in
WordPress. Sacrilege I know :)

In this case it sounds like WordPress is the way you want to go.  Adding the
custom profile fields into WP isn't hard.  I suspect it is even easier than
you think. You won't need to duplicate user.php by any means.

Charly Leetham did a post earlier this month on adding custom profile fields
easily: http://bit.ly/dbZ5pc 
She has some pretty detailed examples in the post. Hope that helps.

Namespacing the options added by plugins has been suggested before, but you
would still need plugin authors to start using the new API for this, so it's
really down to developer education.

If there was some rating system that set a plugin as 'approved' if it 
did indeed clean up after itself, namespacing, and it was clearly marked 
on the plugin page this might encourage devs to do it right.

They should do as that is in RFC822 from what I remember as recommended behaviour.

Out of interest, are there good reasons not to use a custom walker class to
achieve this?

I realise it's a relatively small change and a custom walker could be seen
as overkill, but generally I find in projects that I do need to change css,
or add spans or other stuff to the navigation so I always put in my own
walker class. It also is a bit more futureproof I find as if I need to make
further unanticipated changes to the menu's html & css it can be done with
relative ease.

Message-ID: <4C29D07A.6000506@gmail.com>

Hi,
I don't really understand how useful is this variable.
I update my site from svn and pulled .mo files from automattic svn.
But I get the locale update advice anyway.
I think adding (or replacing) the test in wp-admin/update-core.php would 
do the trick :
( $wp_local_package != $update->locale && ! is_readable( WP_LANG_DIR . 
$update->locale . 'mo' ) )
Because AFAIK if WP_LANG_DIR, the mo file will be loaded so the 
translation is in use.

Message-ID: <b77132d2-2bf0-40d1-8c61-82201193f1a6@x27g2000yqb.googlegroups.com>

Hello,

The custom post type feature is nice! I'd like to be able to filter
custom posts listed on the edit page for custom post types. I can't
find any action filter for the wp query that retrieves the post list.
Everything is now performed dynamically based on the set of
capabilities but the current set of capabilities isn't complete enough
to achieve what I want.

Basically, here is what I would like to achieve :
1/ For the admins, show all posts
2/ For the non admins, only show posts authored by the user browsing
the table

Right now, I can restrict the edition but the posts can still be
viewed into the table.

I see two solutions to achieve this :
1/ either add a new capability called "read_others_posts" and then
fill the table based on it
2/ either add an action filter on the query so that we can add a query
var for the post author

Any other idea to make this directly work with WP 3.0?

I had a similar project in 2 versions. In the first i just tried to
extend wp_users and user meta... and that was a real pain. With the
second (still runing fine) i switched to the pods-plugin
(podscms.org). It gives you the possibility to handle your data in a
separate table with a nice UI and you can, if you want, later connect
the table to your wp_users extending them. As long as you don't set
the "pick-"column to required* you can easily define if someone has an
accessible account or not. Maybe that helps (as it did to me).

  Betting you didn't remove the role first. The add_role will fail if 
the role already exists.

remove_role('treasurer);

add_role( 'treasurer', 'Treasurer', array('read' =>   true,

Brilliant! Thanks Jake, that's fixed it.

So roles/caps are stored in the database? I thought they were just ran
dynamically; thus didn't think I needed to remove any previously added ones.

Cheers again,

They are probably using something like Brad's Theme Showcase plugin

This plugin could be what you're looking for, the ability to switch themes

Using a custom walker or callback for these sort of things has both
advantages and disadvantages.

Advantage: You're in total control of the resulting HTML.
Disadvantage: You're in total control of the resulting HTML.

Generally speaking, you shouldn't have to modify the HTML as a whole.
If you do have to do so, then you're either an extreme edge case, or
the function needs to be modified to give you a better way to only
modify the specific piece that you need to change.

Inserting spans and divs and such simply so you can refer to things in
the CSS is a cheap hacky way of doing things, it seems to me. There's
supposed to be a separation between content and styling here. If you
have to change the content in order to do styling to it, then there
must be some content that is missing in the first place, and it should
be treated as a bug and fixed in the core code itself.

On the other hand, if you can refer to some piece of the markup
already (like by using a selector, for example), then adding extra
markup to refer to it in a different way is wholly unnecessary.

Keeping the same HTML as everybody else means that you're sticking to
a standard way of defining your content in markup. Search Engines and
other HTML parsers (microformats, etc) will have an easier time
understanding your content if it uses the same markup design patterns
as everybody else does.

HTML is supposed to define the content in a semantic way, and that's
it. Adding extra bits onto it solely in order to make it look
different defeats the point. Yes, sometimes you have no choice, but
those cases are rarer and rarer as browsers start supporting all the
CSS goodness.

Absolutely agree, but I have seen several "edge cases" which require that
the navigation include a subtitle, strapline, or thumbnail image, rather
than just a text link.

Is there another way to inject additional fields/ content into a navigation
item that I'm missing?

So actually, it is feasible. I found the trick.

You need to hook there :
add_filter('posts_where','my_posts_where');

And then use this filtering function :
function my_posts_where($where)
{
	global $wpdb, $current_user, $wp_version;

	if ($wp_version >= '3.0' && is_admin() && $_GET['post_type'] ==
'my_post_type')
	{
	       $where = str_replace($wpdb->posts.".post_type = 'my_post_type'
AND",$wpdb->posts.".post_type = 'my_post_type' AND ".$wpdb-
>posts.".post_author = ".$current_user->ID." AND", $where);
	}

	return($where);
}

And you are done!

Now I am wondering how to remove or update the custom post type
numbers at the top as they aren't relevant anymore with this kind of
filtering.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikdy1xR7VPZ3Wtc3dYFM2fdv202pO1zGnDQVC5r@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have created a wp_new_user_notification function to replace the one in
pluggable.php, to send out a welcome mail to new users with some information
& instructions.

I've added two filters to change the from name and from email address:

add_filter( 'wp_mail_from', 'mysite_from_email' );
add_filter( 'wp_mail_from_name', 'mysite_from_name' );

function mysite_from_email( $email ) {
    return "noreply at mysite.com";
}

function mysite_from_name( $name ) {
    return "The MySite website";
}

But the message is always sent from the email address of the user with the
admin role, not from the address given in the mysite_from_email function (or
even from the site email address as in get_bloginfo( 'admin_email' )).

Is this a bug or am I missing something obvious? (I'm using 3.0 and have
tried it on two different sites)

Thanks
Simon

Looking at the source of wp_mail() in pluggable.php (
http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/3.0/wp-includes/pluggable.php
), I suspect another plugin or function is overriding wp_mail_from and
wp_mail_from_name on your site.  If nothing is overriding it and you
didn't make pass any headers to wp_mail, WordPress always sends the
message from "WordPress <wordpress at yourdomain.com>".

Try adding a 

remove_filter( 'wp_mail_from', 'wordpressmu_wp_mail_from' );

to the mix. I think it will do it for you...

Hi hackers,

Just a heads up that I've just released a substantial update for my JSON API plugin. In theory it should be 100% backwards-compatible, but please let me know if you discover any new bugs.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/

This release includes a modular controller system for extending it with new API methods. I'd be interested in getting feedback from the peanut gallery...

Thanks,

Hi Dan,

Excellent!  Will definitely have to take a look at this.  Looks like it
could be very useful for some projects I have lined up.

Will let you know any feedback I have if I do get to have a play with it  :)

Dumb question, perhaps, but is there any reason you didn't want to use
the existing XML-RPC library to get this sort of data? Yes, it's XML,
but javascript can do XML just as easily, and there's a bunch of
XML-RPC client libraries for Javascript.

Hi Dan,

I just looked at your plugin on WordPress.org, totally cool.  

Otto:
I'd far prefer to access JSON via REST than XML via RPC; REST and JSON just make things so much easier, at least for me. I also know lots of local programmers here in Atlanta and when discussed most of them agree so I'm not alone.  More importantly, if an API is easier to use it improves adoption for those who are publishing their APIs.  JMTCW

I'd like to second Mike there too. JSON via REST works much better for me

Oh no, not saying it's not easier or better, just that I tend to
prefer existing interfaces rather than rolling my own, probably
incompatible, way of doing things.

BTW, it wouldn't be difficult at all to implement a JSON system using
the built in feeds mechanism. The add_feed function is pretty darned
powerful when you get right down to it.
add_feed('json','custom_json_output') and a rather trivial
custom_json_output function would implement the ability to get any
post or set of posts in a json format quite easily. You could even do
comments through it. You'd have to go another direction for submitting
comments, but frankly you don't necessarily need json to do that when
a standard POST with the comment can work just fine.

Here's a quick and dirty example:

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: JSON Feed Demo
*/
add_action('init','custom_add_json_feed');
function custom_add_json_feed() {
	add_feed('json','custom_json_output');
}
function custom_json_output($for_comments) {
	global $post;
	header('Content-Type: application/json', true);
	$out_posts = array();
	while (have_posts()) : the_post();
		$out_posts[]=$post;
	endwhile;
	echo json_encode($out_posts);
}



After enabling the plugin, you'll need to update the permalinks (since
I didn't add a flush on activation). After that, /feed/json/ on
anything will produce a json output of the posts in question.

I didn't implement the $for_comments variable, which gets set when
you're asking for a comments feed. You can also implement a callback
by adding your own query variable, if you like. I'll leave those as an
exercise for the reader.

At MoMA.org we're using WordPress in ways that I wasn't confident the existing XML-RPC API would support. Things like post thumbnails and sub-page/category hierarchies and compatibility with multiple authors plugin. Basically I've been optimizing my plugin for simplicity & flexibility, not compatibility with a specification.

Yeah, I started out using the wp-json plugin, but found that our needs outstripped what it has to offer. It could be a good choice for other developers.

	on custom page?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikT-5lZCc1Y5MH4noslexKtsS-tNeA_hG--LdOl@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to modify the WP Calendar Plugin and would like to create a
custom page (not sure I'm using the right terminology) to display All Event
details.

I have the Calendar Plugin Installed and displaying with the Calendar filter
here:  http://mengelit.com/zub/?page_id=33.  However, the link field is
blank by default or submitted by the user.  I would like to auto-populate
the event_link field with a link that would display the event details within
the current site.  I'm not sure if I need to create a custom page template
or something else entirely....

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Thank you for your time.

Matt

Yeah, this is the main reason we chose WordPress instead of doing the blog in Ruby on Rails. The plugin was something that evolved in the course of using content outside the WP template system.

They are indeed stored, as Jake said, which means you should not be adding
roles or caps on init, but rather as a one-off like activation (then remove
on deactivation). OR, you can do that Unfiltered MU does, and do it on init,
but avoid writing to the database. (Cheap hack, but gets the job done.)

That said, there is a $wp_user_roles global that can be used to hard-code
roles and capabilities in wp-config (and the DB would be passed). I know for
example this is what wp.com uses, so you should probably be aware of that as
well.

	Types
Message-ID: <AANLkTil4z9vPl15WkltCleVpjDN1ZasWvDmdOXiqOVV0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm using custom post types and on the edit/create screen I'd like to do two
things:

   1. Have a three column layout for that screen
   The dashboard allows this, and it looks like its handled by JS, so is
   there a filter I should be aware of?

   2. Rename 'Excerpt' to 'Description'
   I'm using that field as the description for the item being added, rather
   than content because I just want a stripped down, small textarea and excerpt
   seems suited to that

Any ideas how would I go about this?

Cheers,

Perhaps hard code it at init?

In my Gecka Submenu plugin, I have used a filter to add the nav_menu
item description in generated menu without using a walker:

// filter to show the description of menu items if asked
add_filter('walker_nav_menu_start_el', array($this,
'walker_nav_menu_start_el'), 10, 4);

then:

public function walker_nav_menu_start_el ($item_output, $item, $depth, $args) {
        if($args->show_description) {

            $desc .= ! empty( $item->description ) ? '<span
class="description">'    . esc_html( $item->description        )
.'</span>' : '';

            if($desc) $item_output = str_replace('</a>', $desc.'</a>',
$item_output);

        }
        return $item_output;
    }

Any ideas why that could be?

$wp_user_roles is designed for ALL roles and capabilities, and a complete
bypass of the DB. That means you'd need to keep up with capabilities we add
to core in future releases, etc... (which is something most roles created by
plugins do not take into account). It's not designed for a distributed
plugin, but rather a serious or specialized and well-maintained network,
though I'm not familiar with what you're working on, of course.

Also, WP needs it before init, as it sets up the current user before then.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinEMbqsllEV_OUYUh0aeh2ld55kwfw-LOBk2Xwt@mail.gmail.com>

I added a custom post type, and designated the role of 'manage_finances' as
the required capability. You would therefore expect that any user with the
cap of 'manage_finances' would be able to view the post types screen and add
more.

Instead, I have to grant them 'edit_posts' and 'delete_posts' for them to
even create draft custom posts, which gives them access to the regular posts
and comments screens.

Wouldn't it be more flexible to possibly have an extended array in
the register_post_type() args, like this:

$args = array(
 'capabilities' => array(
 'edit_posts' => 'add_finances',
 'delete_posts' => 'add_finances',
 'delete_published_posts' => 'manage_finances'
 ),
 'rewrite' => false ...

etc etc

So you could specify which roles were required for each aspect of the custom
post type, because they are currently treated the same as regular posts in
WP and the admin panel.

You can do that already.

Simple capability management: pass capability_type.

Advanced capability management: pass capabilities, an array of capabilities
keyed (exactly how you described it) with edit_post, edit_posts,
edit_others_posts, delete_post, publish_posts, read_post,
read_private_posts. See get_post_type_capabilities() and
register_post_type(), both in wp-includes/post.php.

Note that the meta capabilities have no special mapping/handling that
(edit|delete|read)_post have, when capability_type != post. That will likely
come as an option in 3.1, but you can add that through a filter on
map_meta_cap if you are so inclined.

If you must do a version compare (I would generally not recommend this, and
instead check for functionality -- akin to browser detection versus feature
detection in JS), I would use version_compare().

You can also use get_bloginfo( 'version' ) instead of using the global.

Cheers Andrew,

I'm certainly getting somewhere but it's not quite working. I have the
following array in register_post_type

    'capabilities' => array(
 'edit_posts' => 'manage_finances',
'delete_posts' => 'manage_finances',
 'delete_published_posts' => 'manage_finances',
'publish_posts' => 'manage_finances',
 'edit_published_posts' => 'manage_finances'
),

So the user can view the post screen, but when a post is saved, the user is
directed to example.com/wp-admin/post.php with the message "You are not
allowed to edit this post." - although that cap has been added?

Any ideas?

As far as I can tell from here (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#Author), the
'manage_finances' cap has the same access to the post type as an author
would do?

delete_posts, delete_published_posts, edit_published_posts are invalid for a
post type. Please see the list in my original reply.. You're missing
edit_post in particular, also delete_post, read_post, and
read_private_posts.

Just about to download and have a play, obvious question is how are
you handling security?
I noticed in the docs you have adding posts and comments, and a brief
mention of a get_nonce call?

Cheers

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to rename plugins in the plugin repository?
Message-ID: <006201cb185b$29d7a500$7d86ef00$@org>

Hi,

 

I recently submitted a plugin to the wordpress plugin repository. While
submitting it I made the mistake of providing a long name : "WP Responder -
Email Autoresponder and Newlsetter Plugin'. Now the plugin URL is:

 

http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-responder-email-autoresponder-and-newsle
tter-plugin/

 

When users install the plugin from the dashboard the plugin's directory is:

 

wp-responder-email-autoresponder-and-newsletter-plugin

 

when it should be just:

 

wpresponder

 

I have hardcoded the name of the plugin's directory as 'wpresponder' in the
plugin files. As a result the plugin is creating many problems for those who
download and install the plugin. I am getting a lot of email from users of
the plugin about it. 

 

If the plugin directory was named wpresponder and the svn URL is as shown
below the problem would be solved.

 

http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wpresponder/

 

Could you please tell me how the directory can be renamed? Who should I
contact, what I need to do?

 

Looking forward to your replies,

 

Raj Sekharan

For "restricted" method calls the API currently requires that you be authenticated already, using wp-login.php. Currently the only method with this requirement is create_post (which also requires the use of a nonce). I think the other method that might have a security implication is get_author_index, which could be used for dictionary attacks. I may include an option to selectively disable that method.

I've been contacted by users who've patched the API to include authentication methods, but I'm still evaluating what risks that might impose. I may release both "straight" authentication (user/pass as request vars) and OAuth, and let users decide which is the better choice for their needs -- the settings page lets you enable and disable the various "controllers" of the API. The whole thing is still pretty incomplete though, except basic introspection (the only one enabled by default).

Beyond renaming the plug-in, it's bad practice to hard-code directory names in
the first place. ?Many users will want to rename this folder or that folder for
whatever reason, and hard-coding folder names in your plug-in removes that
ability.
?
Take a multi-blog environment as an example. ?I host several blogs for other
users, and many like to use the same plug-ins but not the same themes.
?Occasionally, a theme comes around that will work with version 1.0 of a
plug-in, but for whatever reason won't work with version 1.2. ?Rather than
telling user A they're out of luck and upgrading for user B (or vice-versa),
I'll install them side-by-side in different folders. ?This way the users can
pick the version that works for them. ?To do this, I have to change folder names
- if I was doing it with your plug-in, I'd then have to go in and change
hard-coded values as well. ?That's a major coding no-no.
?
Instead, I'd recommend using something like define('BASE_URL', dirname(__FILE__)
); to set the current directory name as a constant. ?Then you can reference
BASE_URL elsewhere in your script as necessary.

Thank you piyush and Eric,

I agree that hard coding directory names is a bad practice. I started working on this plugin a little over a year ago when I was something of a wordpress API newbie so I did what worked :) 

All of the emails that my plugin sends to email subscribers have URLs that lead directly to the plugin files. Like this:

http://www.youriste.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-responder-email-autoresponder-and-newsletter-plugin/confirm.php?p=[some_10_character_string_identifies_subscriber]

Many email providers, especially Gmail, strip out URLs in emails that are too long. As you can see the biggest offender is the plugin's directory name which is unnecessarily long. So it is becoming a problem for the users of the plugin. 

Obviously I will have to change the plugin such that it doesn't link directly to one of the plugin files. But now....as of day 5 after submitting to wp extend directory the plugin has had around 610 downloads which I think is pretty impressive. It's really painful to think about all those people having installed the plugin and not many of them being able to use this plugin reliably. I need to solve this problem ASAP.

Please help.

Raj

A quick solution to that would be to add a rewrite rule to WordPress to shorten
the URL. ?Then it would be something like:
http://www.yoursite.com/?wpresponder=[some_10_character_string]. ?You can tell
WordPress to pass this string directly to the file that uses it and perform an
internal redirect to put the user on the right page. ?If you really want to get
into it, you can support pretty permalinks here, too:
http://www.yoursite.com/wpresponder/some_10_character_string.
?
I have a very rough system that does this in my RegLevel plug-in:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/reglevel/ ?It allows users to create
secondary registration pages for each user type on their site. ?Visitors can
register on these secondary pages by going to
http://www.yoursite.com/?reglevel=Some_user_defined_string.
?

You should rework that to use a URL that goes to the root of the
installation instead, using a custom query variable.

Instead of linking to the confirm.php file, do something like this:

add_action('init','my_init');
function my_init() {
	// check for my special variable name
	if(isset($_GET['confirm_email'])) {
		include ('confirm.php);
		die;
	}
}

Then link to http://example.com/?confirm_email=whatever. Your main
plugin will notice this on init, then can include the confirm.php file
to do the work, then die off gracefully (or redirect, or whatever is
appropriate).

Message-ID: <e32bc415-8672-4a68-8dbc-54f6d03b8603@j8g2000yqd.googlegroups.com>

Hi list members,

because of an older problem i just looked into /wp-includes/
functions.wp-styles.php on lines 77-106 at the wp_enqueue_style()
function and realised that the problem i had could come from line 105
$enqueue( $handle ).

I tried to add a stylesheet named "global" (@ $handle) for a theme and
got instead a admin-stylesheet registered. Is it neccassary to set
$handle to required and favor it upon $src (optional)? I guess it's
because you can easily register core-stylesheets/-scripts with only
for ex. wp_enqueue_style( 'global' ); or
wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery' );, but i would (personally) prefer to set
$src to a higher priority.

Thanks.

-K.

try using plugin dependency with svn(setup the name you want and
release a new version of the current plugin tht depends on the other
shoter named one. not a very good workaround though) or try directory
renaming may be with a new version of the plugin.
having some url shortening technique is also a good option. try
talking to some core devs about this though they may be able to help.
join #wordpress-dev on IRC and look for some core dev to help u with
the renaming on svn

Also, you're very likely not going to have any luck getting the name
in the repository changed. I suggest you deal with the problem instead
of expecting somebody to change this for you.

The related error I most often see is that a plugin hard codes that it runs out of the plugins directory, and that isn't always the case.

For example, WPMU ran plugins out of the mu-plugins directory.  On installs I've worked with, certain plugins run out of another subdirectory in order to allow custom activation/deactivation that is outside the blog administrator's control.  The plugins that hardcode their location have to be altered to allow a generic location.

Subject: [wp-hackers] 'Press This' Meta Boxes
Message-ID: <AANLkTikjdywSD4n-1EjYk-p-rHIMEKsSZVYJfWmAc9e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

Today I looked into "Press  This" a little more, and noticed there was
no way of add extra meta boxes to the page. A simple one-liner would
allow for people to add the meta boxes to that page as well, without
editing the core file.

I just added <?php do_action( 'add_meta_boxes', 'press-this' , $post);
?> to the pres-this.php file towards the bottom, and I was able to
hook my meta box into it, and everything worked fine and dandy.

I assume this is the best way of doing it. Is this something that
could be integrated into the core file sometime in the future?

Yeah cool. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't not included for a
certain reason. I'll look into making a ticket if other people think
its something worth while.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Removing admin-ajax.php hacks
Message-ID: <2BB24BBC87D490418DE901138ACDA0DB41BC972891@srv-exch-02.pariveda.local>

I've been asked to remove some hacks to an exisiting WPMU installation, and the one that's causing me the most grief are the edits to admin-ajax.php. The previous maintainer altered the security checks on several activities, changing

    if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_post', $pid ) )

to

    if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_post', $pid ) && !current_user_can( 'moderate_comments' ) )

I have been digging quite a bit, but can't seem to find a way to alter the admin-ajax.php scripts in the correct manner. The goal of the customization was to allow a "Comment Moderator" role that could moderate comments, but not edit blog posts (somewhat obvious, but I thought I'd spell it out). The role was created using Capability Manager, but these hacks were added to the ajax to allow the role to work as intended.

Any guidance on the right way to remove this customization would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

I think the discussion on additional software like plugins to be installed
on enterprise servers is not a WordPress specific problem.

In general whether it's Oracle software, Microsoft software, IBM software,
whatever brand there is always the friction between the development project
and the group that has to put it under maintenance. Two total different
worlds.

In general I think it depends on the list of requirements you agree upon
with the business in the first place. Because if a business partner really
wants a specific requirement that can only be fulfilled with a plugin then
this will in general overrule maintenance and security teams. If this really
conflicts with a non functional requirement such as security then it can
become an issue and has to be escalated to the business partner to make a
decision on it so the business should make the decision not the maintenance
team. Once the business says "I want it", the tek teams can jump as high as
they want but it needs to go in.

If there are no signed requirements for a specific piece of additional
software up front then of course the maintenance department will say no. So
don't sell "WordPress" but sell a solution with a list of matching business
requirements instead (imho).

In general I think Enterprises will include an architectural review before
signing. So this means that your architects and the architects from the
company sit together and make some architectural overviews, some high level
use cases and maybe already some high level non functional requirements. So
maybe even before signing these non functional requirements versus a plugin
discussion can already come up. And I think (indeed) that
the trustworthiness of an additional specific supplier plays then a large
part in the outcome.  In general the "functional architecture" is based on
use cases and is understandable by the client. The "non functional
architecture" goes to the infra architect / security / etc... to make some
detailed models based on that.

I think the deployment, configuration management and maintenance of the
plugins is only in a later phase when the project has already started
because that would come of more detailed designs from the project on the one
hand and the operational detailed model on the other hand. I think that is
more "technical" and like "they will find a solution for problems".

So to prevent discussions "in the technical implementation" it is best to
cover your ass to make the list of requirements as long and as specific as
possible during the first phase and have them signed off. Then there will be
no discussions later. If there are problems to be expected then these will
only affect your time planning.

And make different waves of implementation. The first on requirements only
for WordPress and then a second wave under a second contract for specific
plugins that makes it also easier to "glide in" these extra business
requirements.

Then again nothing new compared to any other software project.

IMHO

I wanted to suggest WP-CRM but I see http://rolopress.com/ maybe that is
also interesting did not dive into it.
Look great. I dont know if Steve Brunner is also on this list.
