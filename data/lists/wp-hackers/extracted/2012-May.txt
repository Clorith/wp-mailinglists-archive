Also as a FYI, instead of running a PHP Module (as core WordPress
requires) you can use a Plugin to enable a PHP-only mode using
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ssh-sftp-updater-support/

I think you need to inform how many posts/page with "posts_per_page", so
wp_page_navi can figure out the pagination.

Maye this heslp: http://pastebin.com/KJB8nXM7 is an example using ajax for
load extra posts, but the wp_pagenavi can reuse the query as well. There`s
no really need to inform the taxo in query, as the filename will do this,
but I do needed to inform how many posts.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin directory omits some of my plugins
Message-ID: <CAKzku9=v_JXWXRXWnVj0NPzpAcCKR8hkXW6oWm=Bb0NBF=y=iA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've just noticed than my profile at
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/wet does not list all of
my plugins (e.g.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/body-mass-index-calculator-widget/).

These plugins also seem to be unavailable from a plugin search
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=body+mass+index+widget)

Whom am I to contact to request a fix for this issue?

Regards,

Robert

Looks like it was closed. A quick peek at the code, and it seems to be embedding links without asking permission first.

Please check your plugin doesn't violate any of the developer guidelines, and then email plugins at wordpress.org :)

Thanks Dion.  I actually checked that out as well and was thinking of going that route as well.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP User Query with two meta keys
Message-ID: <4FA00F07.2030601@gmail.com>

Is it possible to select a user matching "two" meta keys and values, in 
WP User Query?

E.g.  select users where:
plant = "oak"
AND
town = "town"

Much like WP_Query's meta_query.

If not - how would you go about this?

Thanks,

It is possible indeed. Give it a go. 

Take a look at meta_query in WP_Query docs in the Codex if you require
help with the correct formatting. Or post here.

Actually ... I'm going to defer on this. I thought it was possible, but
looking at the code + running a few tests it may not be after all.

Can anyone else provide Rob with the answer he's after?

Not with WP_User_Query, no.

Direct SQL queries is the only way I know of. There isn't any support
for it in the core objects at present.

You could extend the WP_User_Query class to add support for more fine
grained meta queries, but again, you'd be writing new SQL in that
class.

You can cheat and use the WP_Tax_query class.
Create your $tax_query array of arrays like you would for a post query,
then instantiate a WP_Tax_Query.

$my_query = new WP_Tax_Query( $tax_query );
Then get the the SQL like this
$sql = $my_query->get_sql( $wpdb->users, 'ID' );
You then have the bitt to add to your query: use $sql['join'] and
$sql['where']

I'm working on a project now in BuddyPress which doesn't use the the
WP_User_Query class otherwise I might already have an example for you.

I think you're thinking of post meta queries. :)

Yesterday I did some work on building SQL to search for a large number of users to be deleted from a WP multisite. Might be of interest to you:


         //get a list of users with a specia meta_key (birthday party reminder)
         $users_with_meta = $wpdb->get_results('select '.$wpdb->usermeta.'.user_id, '.$wpdb->users.'.display_name, '.$wpdb->users.'.user_email' .
                                        ' from '.$wpdb->usermeta.', '.$wpdb->users.
                                        ' where '.$wpdb->usermeta.'.user_id='.$wpdb->users.'.ID and'.
                                        ' meta_key like "dob_%"'.
                                        ' group by user_id');
	



	//a list of admin users from all blogs in the network
         $users_admin = $wpdb->get_results('select '.$wpdb->usermeta.'.user_id, '.$wpdb->users.'.display_name, '.$wpdb->users.'.user_email' .
                                        ' from '.$wpdb->usermeta.', '.$wpdb->users.
                                        ' where '.$wpdb->usermeta.'.user_id='.$wpdb->users.'.ID and'.
                                        ' meta_key like "wp%_capabilities" and'.
                                         ' meta_value like "%admin%"'.

People, WP_User has had support for 'meta_query' since WP 3.2:

Let me try that again:

Support for 'meta_query' was introduced to WP_User_Query at the same time
it was introduced for WP_Query, in WP 3.1.

And the 'relation' inner parameter was introduced in WP 3.2:

Message-ID: <CABQWr5zY822Lrp8pEn3woJ5yAxC1xvcTDy1JBQVphvY5ZfTy_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Can someone please give me an early morning troubleshooting assist.

I have a client WordPress 3.3.2 site for which the permalink redirects were
not working this morning.  (I am not getting any useful tips about what the
client did, but it was a 3.3.1 site last I touched it, so...)

The behavior was that the root index page came up fine (but imageless) but
all the links went nowhere because permalink redirects weren't happening.
I logged in and reset the permalinks and the pages began to redirect again,
but I still have no images.

I'm this is a simple enough matter, but it has caught me by surprise and I
really can't afford to lose the morning to it.  Can anyone steer me in the
right direction, please?

Thanks for any help.

Doh! Forget my contribution to this thread. I was thinking 'taxonomies' all
along, which WP_User_Query doesn't support, rather than meta_data which the
original poster mentioned, and which, as Scribu points out, it does..

First thought: check Settings -> General, Site address and WP Address. Also
check www versus non-www (and if that's involved, check the DNS).
Second thought: This is more of a support forums query.

Thanks for both of your thoughts, Mike.  General settings seem correct and
I've updated them for good measure to no avail.  www vs. non-www seems to
have no effect.

If the permalink redirects for the pages & posts went from broken to fixed
when I updated the permalink settings, is there something different about
how permalink redirects are handled for media vs pages & posts?

On your advice, I posted to the support forums.

Thanks

One theory might be that your .htaccess had been removed or corrupted, and
re-saving permalink settings restored it.

Thanks.  That was kind of my thinking, too.  But what I don't undertsand
is:  If resaving the .htacess (by updating the permalink settings) fixed
the page & post redirections, why does it not also fix the media
permalinks?  Is that handled in some other way?

 Not that I know of - I'd probably start eliminating plugins at this point.
And Mike was right, the forums are the place for guidance on that.

In ASP, we are advised to turn response.buffer to true. So, that's
what I do right after forcing variable decs.
What about in PHP? Do you guys always turn it on?

How about wordpress? Is it on with WP? If not, are there any issues
turning it on thru a plug in - or by manually inserting into
wp_config.php?

And if there are ASP guys here, what's equivalent of ASP's
response.flush in PHP?
Response.flush sends the output of what's been buffered so far to the
client. That helps browser show input much faster.

Haluk,

I don't know ASP, but if I understand you correctly, PHP does this by
default; it does have options for turning on output buffering when needed,
or for flushing those buffers when they're in use:
http://php.net/manual/en/book.outcontrol.php

In general, output buffering for any application is suggested against
in web apps.. My only reasoning for why ASP might be different would
be a flame war against ASP devs (or the way things are coded).

Output buffering's only advantage is
 1. Gziping the content ( I suspect this is why you'd do it in ASP?)
 2. Allowing headers to be sent after the html output starts. (Maybe
this is why ASP does it?  If the doc starts with <!DOCTYPE.. with
inline ASP after that, you'll need response buffering to be able to
issue headers)

in general, you wouldn't use PHP Output buffering to enable gzip
anymore, you'll use either the web servers builtin compression, or use
PHP's zlib compression (Which while is still output buffering, it's
not the same as PHP's output buffer functions):
http://php.net/manual/en/zlib.configuration.php

As for the flush counterparts.. it's.. well.. flush(), but if you use
output buffering, it's also ob_flush(), ob_flush_all() and maybe
multiple calls to them (see wp_ob_flush_all() for a wrapper).

tl;dr: Avoid output buffering if at all possible, It's faster for web
apps to send data over the wire as it's generated, saves memory
footprint, saves latency, gets the browser rendering things faster,
etc.

This is debatable[1][2] and mostly not true[3].

Beside caching and gzip-ing, a reason to use output buffering is in case

Number 3 is a extremely poor article/reasoning for output buffering,
If anything, It's suggesting that output buffering in the way
generally used in the PHP world is a bad thing.
What it does suggest, is that the output buffering configuration
should be tweaked to send chunks of data sooner rather than later,
which is the opposite of most php output buffers.

Most web servers will have a builtin output buffer to send the data in
reasonable sized chunks as well, each servers defaults are different,
and each can be configured differently.
For example, apache with mod_deflate enabled has a 8K buffer - that
is, It reads 8K from the source (PHP, FastCGI, static content, etc)
compresses that, and sends it over the wire.

Links 1 and 2 also have a similar issue, The content they quote saying
it's a advantage is actually advocating disabling full page output
buffers, and flushing buffers early to speed up data being sent over
the wire for faster rendering by the client.

Finally, yes, there are places where output buffering is useful - to
catch echo'd content directly to alter it or cache it, infact, this is
what most WordPress caching plugins do (well, all of them do it). But
you have to be doing it for a reason for it to be of use.. caching and
some template engines require it, general programming though? It
shouldn't need it at all.

Running full page output buffering - that is, storing every bit of
HTML output from a script into a variable in memory before sending it
to the client, is not going to be of benefit in general, and will
simply lead to more resources being used, and a slower site as a
result.

tl'dr: I disagree with all of the links in the way you're interpreted them.

Fyi, I didn't interpret any links, I gave examples on how and when people  
use output buffering. You might agree or not, but thats your opinion.
Also, there's no such term _general programming_, it's just programming!

Let's just agree on the above paragraph from your reply... As I said, this  
is debatable.

By associating two of the references with the word "debatable", and one of
them with "mostly not true", you did, indeed interpret them.

There is a reason the lower level 'engines'; apache web server, OS file
handling libraries, etc. do buffering for you (using higher level
languages):  it's because they do it best; it's because they hold the
connection to the output stream and know when the pipe is empty and ready
for the next packet of data and when it is busy so output must be buffered.

There are a number of programming paradigms that are far, far from general
programming: high speed I/O for instance, machine control for another
example (both fields I have worked in), programming where you interface
directly with the hardware; in those instances there might be reasons to
handling your own buffering, and to program in a way that would be odd and
even a little counter-intuitive to many general programmers. However this
is wandering off-topic.

does WP turn on the output_buffering ( or does it not care? - it
leaves it up to the php config )

And if I do turn it on (for some reason - maybe to get a hold of the
entire HTML being sent to the client), does it in any shape or form
interfere with the way WP works? In other words, can I just turn it on
or off on a page by page basis?

WordPress doesn't use it, unless you use a plugin which does (for
example, a caching plugin).
WordPress works with it on, or off.
You can enable it on the fly for pages/sections you need to use it in
and it'll cause no ill effects to WordPress

It's kind of irrelevant but for some reason it seemed appropriate to
me to ask the following right very now.

How about sessions. Can we say the same thing for sessions?
Turn it on or off anytime, no ill effects to WP whatsoever.

I can agree with that and probably should have stated that my opinion is  
that "using buffering is ok".
But links were there for offering readers material for own judging.

As WordPress does not use Sessions to control the logged in state, it
makes no difference. If enabled, WordPress will simply ignore it, If
disabled, WordPress will simply, well, ignore it.

A plugin, or theme, can safely enable Session support by calling
session_start(); on an appropriate hook (ie. before the template is
output, early on init would probably be best).

One of the times I was playing with sessions & BackPress/WordPress 
integration, there was something in the WP initialization that caused me 
to end up in a different session after WP initialization hit.  Watch for 
that... I never did fix that problem and ended up abandoning sessions.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Managing Multiple WP Sites
Message-ID: <4FA3355D.3050208@gmail.com>

Hi,

#1. I'd like to know if it's possible to manage 3 sites - with different 
.com domains, hosted on the same server - under 1 WP dashboard.

As in site1.com, site2.com. site3.com

AND NOT sub1.site.com, sub2.site.com, sub3.site.com or site.com/sub1, 
site.com/sub2, site.com/site3

#2. And if it's possible, how do I go about doing it? A link to a 
reliable article about this is fine. I've been googling around and seem 
to have a hard time finding one that "reliably" works as some would 
point out that the "steps" doesn't work on their install or some 
articles don't make it clear whether the end result domains would end up 
as site1.com, site2.com and site3.com, etc. Most of the articles I found 
used WP MU in some way.

Here are a couple of plugins I'm considering:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/
http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping

#3. And if it's possible, will the solution still work if in the future 
the client wants to add a subdomain on one of the sites so that we now have
blog.site1.com
site1.com
site2.com
site3.com

Server is VPS, all domains hosted on the same server. Solution doesn't 
have to use WP MU. All that matters is to manage all 3 (and future) 
domains on one WP admin area.

Thank you so much for your help!

It's really not that hard.

Install WordPress at site1.com

Turn on Multisite.

Your sites will INITIALLY be site1.com/site2 (or site2.site1.com), don't panic.

Then you install Domain Mapping plugins (the free one from wp.org is great, works perfectly).

Park the domain site2.com on top of site1.com, and map it via the plugin to site1.com/site2 (whatever).

That's. It. The hardest part is getting the domain parked, but once you do that, the rest is a cake walk.

See it in action:
ipstenu.org
halfelf.org (which is 'secretly' tech.ipstenu.org)

If you need more help with that, there are the forums :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Correct way of adding author to Custom Post Slug
Message-ID: <4FA3C45B.50205@gmail.com>

I'm trying to setup the default Permalink Sturcture for a Custom post 
type to match as the following:

/custompost/%category%/%author%/post-name

And I'm at a complete loss on how to do it...

I tried 'rewrite' => array('slug' => custompost/%author%') in 
register_post_type, and then some filtering on post_type_link to replace 
%author%, but that doesn't help with category.

It also doesn't work when loading an archive page:
http://example.com/custompost/category -> 404
http://example.com/custompost/category/author -> Loads, but informs me 
that no results were found for the requested archive, even though there are.

I'm sure this shouldn't be this complicated so what am I missing?

Thanks in advance.

Rob.

Hi Mika,

Thank you for your help. So I just need to know how to "park" domains 
and that should be it.. hmmmm.. cool.. can you point me to some reliable 
resources? I know that's what google is for but there's too much 
information (some of it conflicting) and I'm not sure which are the 
right ones to follow.

Thank you!

Easiest thing would be to ask your web host "How do I park another domain on top of the one I have?"

They'll have directions specific to their setup, and limit the guesswork you have to do.

I bit of offtopic: last time I checked multisite was a very long and

I'd say 'No, it's neither long nor requiring sysadmin in most situations.' But I'm aware I'm a little biased.

What it DOES require is comfortability with getting into your system via SFTP/SSH and editing files manually.

Most hosts work just fine out of the box, and when they don't, the codex has the major issues covered (as do multiple online tutorials etc).

I have set up Multisite not long ago and taking there all my sites. I have

Subject: [wp-hackers] What are the point in hooking the `init` when writing
	a plugin?
Message-ID: <CAJvdmtECmOxQvxfFC=s8ytqxb4z1XDmOCGYSPb_sX-pGN2djgg@mail.gmail.com>

I think this is the same when you can put the code inside the main plugin file?

e.g. akismet: http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/akismet/trunk/akismet.php

======================================================
function akismet_init() {
	global $wpcom_api_key, $akismet_api_host, $akismet_api_port;

	if ( $wpcom_api_key )
		$akismet_api_host = $wpcom_api_key . '.rest.akismet.com';
	else
		$akismet_api_host = get_option('wordpress_api_key') . '.rest.akismet.com';

	$akismet_api_port = 80;
}
add_action('init', 'akismet_init');

======================================================

Why not just execute `akismet_init` directly? I can't see any drawback
and sound not really useful to hook the init?

In the case of akismet there, there's no much difference, but there
are subtle differences that don't show.

1. WordPress isn't fully loaded when plugins are included, many
functions are undefined, and not configured properly (ie. WP_Query,
and user functions)

2. Loading on init allows for other plugins to affect it, so in
Akismets case, another plugin hooked on an earlier priority than
akismet can set the $wpcom_api_key global to something useful

3. Another plugin might unhook your init function in the event that it
doesn't need to be run all the time, you should never see this in a
general plugin, but some sites have been known to unhook a plugins
relativly expensive init process and substitute it with their own for
their niche site/etc.

So it's primarily good practice due to point 1, but there are other
hidden reasons why.

another method often used is the following, although it executes
straight away and instantates itself, it leaves the grunt of the work
until WordPress is loaded before it does anything:

class Plugin_XYZ {
  function __construct() {
     add_action( 'init', array( $this, 'init' ) );
  }
}
$GLOBALS['plugin_xyz'] = new Plugin_XYZ();

I agree. two steps (apache) should do it:

1. point dns to the correct ip

2. Add a ServerAlias directive to the primary virtual host configuration.
Your hosting provider should have documentation on this, and different
control panels may call out something different.
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#serveralias

Message-ID: <CAJvdmtHvxUSi8n3ZDHgAFqgT8D2-=+ouB_fRYh4wVR1RgtFs3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

What are the easy way to translate Category Name?

a. I have tried this plugin but not working:
http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/polyglot/trunk/translate-categories.php
b. Have tried to hook the filer "wp_get_object_terms" and "get_term",
some of the pages are working (mainly front-end), but some are not
working (mainly backend), e.g. post.php, edit-tags.php


So what are the recommended way to alter category name at runtime?

thanks..

My suspicion is this won't be possible with a single WP_Query. You may
have to do two, concatenate the resulting arrays, and maybe re-sort
using something like usort().

You can use an array for the post_type parameter in WP_Query, ie:

     $query = new WP_Query( array( 'post_type' => array( 'post', 
'fdp-post' ) ) );

The issue then is, how to do a tax_query that for only restricting one
post type by category. Probably not possible

You might attack things differently by doing the above type of query
and then manually filtering stuff in PHP according to taxonomy, but I
wonder if this might end up with more DB hits than doing two
WP_Queries, one for each post type, and then concatenating and sorting
in PHP.

Apologies, I totally missed that part of the OP's question.

I believe you're right that the tax_query will apply to both post types.

Time to learn some mysql and do a custom select query.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Displaying_Posts_Using_a_Custom_Select_Query

Try something like this replacing the slug below ('slug-for-my-term')
for whichever you need to query on. Please beware that if you populate
this query dynamically you will need to user the $wpdb->prepare method
to make certain it is secure.

SELECT * from wp_posts p
LEFT JOIN wp_term_relationships rel ON rel.object_id = p.ID
LEFT JOIN wp_term_taxonomy tt ON tt.term_taxonomy_id = rel.term_taxonomy_id
LEFT JOIN wp_terms t ON t.term_id = tt.term_id
WHERE p.post_status = 'publish' AND ( ( p.post_type = 'post' AND
t.slug = 'slug-for-my-term' AND tt.taxonomy = 'category') OR
p.post_type = 'fdp-post' )
GROUP BY p.ID
ORDER BY p.post_date,DESC

Cheers,

Mike

I think custom SQL queries are in most cases a bad idea. You should use it
only if you really need it.

The drawbacks are that you don't rely on the WordPress abstraction methods
so you don't prevent some future changes on the database.
Plus, you don't use actions and filters placed by the WordPress core, so
plugins or themes you use won't be able to hook on them, and you probably
won't have the custom functionalities provided by those plugins / themes.

In case you *really *want and need to do this into one query, use the most
appropriate filter (like 'posts_where' or others) to re-write the tinyer
portion of the WP_Query.

thank you everyone for help :) you realised me that this will
implicate many strange things to support, so i did it in different way
:)

i added support for category in my post type:
...
'taxonomies' => array('category'),
...

and i input thesame category for my cutom post type, so now when i
query for posts with category 'fdp' i see expected results :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Change default display name for new users
Message-ID: <4FA82C5A.3050404@gmail.com>

Is there a hook or filter that can be used to override the default 
display name? Can't seem to see on in the code, but sure I'm missing 
something.

In my install it makes more sense for display_name to be first name + 
last name for all new users, rather than login name.

Thanks,
Robert.

I think that actually makes more sense for pretty much everyone. If you 
write a patch for core I'll back it.

Put this in a plugin or something similar.

add_filter('pre_user_display_name','default_display_name');
function default_display_name($name) {
if ( isset( $_POST['display_name'] ) )
 return sanitize_text_field( $_POST['display_name'] );

if ( isset( $_POST['first_name'] ) ) {
 $name = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['first_name'] );
if ( isset( $_POST['last_name'] ) )
 $name .= ' '. sanitize_text_field( $_POST['last_name'] );
}
 return $name;
}

That will change the default display name at the time of user creation to
be firstname lastname.

wp_get_shortlink() only works for posts, it doesn't work for pages (as
the trac ticket you found suggests) or custom post types.
If you're wanting to output a post ID, there are functions to do that,
such as this:

echo get_post_id();

As things stand, this is currently more correct: the pre_user_display_name
filter is called before the corresponding pre_user_first_name and
pre_user_last_name filters. So any changes the latter two filters make will
not be reflected in the display name.

I think the correct solution would be to simply move the construction and
filtering of display_name to after the all the other name parts in core.
That way the existing filters are enough to make the change. Optionally, a
default filter could be put in place to change the current behaviour.

Is there a valid reason you can not change your username via the user 
editor in wp-admin?

Can't seem to see anything, but suspect there might be?

Looking to 'create' this functionality on the front-end, (where username 
is email address), however wondering what/if any side effects this may 
cause?

Thanks as ever,
Rob.

Serialization in WP Multisite would be my first guess.

Speaking from a purely administrative standpoint, users who change their username come in two kinds.

1) People who made bad usernames and want to rectify their lack of foresight
2) a**hats who like to pretend to be other people, just to piss you off

Because of #2, I've always been pro-locking a username down. Display name, fine. But your user name is your username. Choose wisely, Indy.

Today I browsed through some core files and noticed that WordPress is 
using all versions of ellipsisses (correct plural?): poor man's ellipsis 
('...'), #8230; and hellip; throughout the code - not very consistent. 
Before creating a ticket I would like to know if the consent is to use 
"&hellip;" instead of the others.

(I omitted the "&" characters to avoid interpretations by the reader 
software.)

Thanks Mika. Been having this discussion recently, and came to the 
conclusion that "email address" is best practise for a username.

Users can remember it, it saves having to create "another" unique 
identifer (email address should be unique anyway), and provides for a 
quicker "sign-up" process.

The down side - of course - being that email addresses change (hence the 
question above). Quite sure there will be people on both sides of the 
fence on this one.

Rob.

You cannot add user in Multisite with the Email addresses as the username.

Oops, missed that three year old ticket. Let's hope it won't get punted 
again in 3.5 since from time to time new tickets appear fixing *some* 
occurrences of ... and 8230.

There are already plugins for that. (tl;dr You can't natively on Multisite because of the username being the default new blog name. Perhaps it would be better to allow any character in names, like we do on Single Site, but strip non-alphanumeric on the blogname generation? )

FYI, as an admittedly edge case, I have built a number of (related) sites
where a unique (or even any) email address is not guaranteed.

These are sites for schools to use in class. In some schools, a class will
have one email address for all students (especially the younger ones), or
they may have none, or they may block external email like hotmail. I can
tell you it's no fun getting WordPress to play nicely in those
circumstances!

Really that's not THAT hard. Just run a check on email address at registration. if NOT foo at myschool.edu ...

I want to say I've seen a plugin for that. As for the one-ring email issues, you may be better off just making accounts for them. But that's a YMMV edge case :/ Study WP and create your workflow for what it is, rather than trying to force WP to fit the workflow you have. :) Sometimes you have to be more adaptable than your tool.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Duplicating the admin menu builder functionality
Message-ID: <CAEgmxaZNE9QS62g9Zhmf6ciHGgoXQme6LOJ1nyqF0mMJ0mSv3w@mail.gmail.com>

I come across various scenarios where I would like to build an admin screen
that groups a set of (custom post type) posts that can be ordered.

To give a silly, trivial example: You have a bunch of books, and want them
in the following groups:
 - In my library, sorted alphabetically
 - Books I have read, sorted by date read
 - Restricted access e-books, sorted by expiry date

It seems to me that the menu builder functionality is perfect for this. It
has all the set creation as well as drag and drop ordering. However, I
can't present it to the site-admin like that. They simply will not
understand.

So ... is there a way to grab all that menu goodness, rebadge it with
'Library', add some auto-sorting (and restrict it to a single post type)?

Tom

We're discussing a project where the client has asked for users to login
using email and password. The current suggestion is to look into
auto-generating a username (so it can be anything random) together with
allowing log in using the user's email address. Means they can change their
email address and still log into the same account.

Last year, something similar was requested, but they also wanted multiple
accounts per email address. That didn't go ahead. But I did look into it at
time and blogged a little snippet about logging with email (may or may not
still work):

WordPress normally refuses to create a user with a duplicate email (it's
not directly filterable -- I ended up defining WP_IMPORTING to hack around
the problem). And we needed some users to have valid emails, so we wanted
to keep the existing validation in place, just add to it to say 'empty is
ok', 'duplicate is ok' (for the right type of user). Plus it wasn't one
particular school it was *any* school.

The project started in the 2.9 era too, where there were less hooks to do
what we wanted. On top of that it's multisite, which adds it's own hoops to
jump through, like not creating users at all on registration, and expecting
to validate/activate via an email -- oops! not everyone has an email.

Note: I have successfully overcome all these problems, but some things were
harder than others.

Also we are running at 20,000+ users so creating by hand was not an option.

And finally, I *have* studied WordPress -- for slightly longer than anyone
but Matt :-)

Message-ID: <CAMg3evHz0xe_V6Q7aFsNWBGTSXRpqz7gAVSBkD_UbxOG9Z+X=A@mail.gmail.com>

I've been poking through my mutli-site database in an effort to understand
where the information that connects a user to each specific blog is stored.
 My search through the Codex and Support Forums hasn't yielded anything
either.  I have a plugin I am trying to ensure works correctly with WPMS
and it looks at the users.  Right now I am showing all of the users
registered on the network and not just the ones assigned to the specific
blog and I am not sure how to limit my list to the subset of users who have
been assigned access to the blog.

Thanks,

Mike

Mike,

The key is that under MS a user can have access to more than one blog. There are two elements in the usermeta table to look into: 

1. 'primary_blog' - As the key_name implies this is the user's primary blog. Will only contain one blog ID.

2. As for when a user can access other blogs the key is in the capabilities. If you view the usermeta table for a user you will see a record with a meta_key like 'wp_4_capabilities'. This means the user has access to blog 4. A given user may have multiple 'wp_XX_capabilities' rows where 'XX' is the blog ID. You can access this information simply by using the MS function get_blogs_of_user($user_id) see wp-includes/user.php line 652. This will return a list of blogs for the user. There is also a compliment function is_user_member_of_blog($user_id, $blog_id) for a simple user check. 

2b. There is also a handy function get_blog_details($blog_id) to obtain the blog details. Better than a direct query on the blogs table. 

Hope this helps. 

P-

This is exactly what I was looking for, thank you!

Will the primary blog also be present in the meta table as a
wp_XX_capabilities entry?

In short I have not really had issues when changing usernames, even on MU sites.
FYI, there is a nice plugin for doing this:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpvn-username-changer/
Prevents you having to mess around in PHPMyAdmin. :)

Yes, you can try this out. Assumed you have blog 1 with a normal admin, editor, author. Now go to your last site blog 10 for example. So to Users > Add New. There are two parts. Add Existing User or Add New User. In the Add Existing User enter the email address for a user from another blog (not a super admin). Now if you view the usermeta for that user in your database you should see something like:

http://screencast.com/t/2ntX0qkhl0RU

You will also see another row in usermeta  'wp_XX_user_level'. Since a user can be an admin on one blog but a lowly author on another blog. 

The one caveat I found with this logic is the super admin. The super admin will not show these wp_XX_user_level' or 'wp_XX_capabilities' entries in the usermeta information. You will need to call is_superadmin to check if a user is a super admin. They will automatically have access to all blogs.

Message-ID: <4FAAE4A1.6050206@gmail.com>

Just noticied that when running a custom WP_Query, setting:
'posts_per_page' => -1 & 'offset' => 1
the offset will get ignored.

Offset works fine if posts_per_page is any value other than -1.

Thoughts? Bug? Or as -1 is meant to return everything, should it stay? 
Expected outcome was to run everything, except the first (e.g. 
everything offset by 1).

Yes, I believe so.

Also note that the wp_ in the meta key isn't always wp_  Instead it is 
the table prefix as defined in wp-config.

MySQL doesn't have a way to specify an offset with no maximum limit of
rows returned. So if you set posts_per_page to -1, then the nopaging
flag gets set to true, and no LIMIT clause is added to the query.

So, not "bug", just a limitation of the underlying database system.

If you want to get "all" posts with an offset, specify the
posts_per_page as a ludicrously high number instead. The MySQL
reference uses this exact approach with this example:
SELECT * FROM tbl LIMIT 95,18446744073709551615;

Which would be an offset of 96, and the posts_per_page as
18,446,744,073,709,551,615. Which is clearly insane, but should work.
I might pick a smaller number though. :)

The things I ended up using for solution were:

   1. get_users(array('blogid' => get_current_blog_id(), 'fields' => 'ID'))
   which returned a clean array of user ids.
   2. $wpdb->prefix
   3. $wpdb->base_prefix

Between the combination of these three I was able to get my plugin to work
correctly with both standard WordPress and Multi-Site, thanks for the
pointers to the multi-site functions and explanation of the relevant meta
data, both got me going in the right direction.

Anything is possible with the appropriate amount of JavaScript (that's

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to make $post->ID global
Message-ID: <99D9F0F658D3472C8D7EBA1559C7633C@seodavelt>

Trying to use the post id in an included php file which is basically an extension of functions.php (tried the code in functions.php as well with no success).

Examples of what I've tried


global $post;
$postsid = $post->ID;
echo 'test '.$postsid;


and


global $wp_query;
$postsid = $wp_query->post->ID;
echo 'test '.$postsid;


This fails when added to the included file (and functions.php), works when added to header.php.

Have tried global $postsid; when using $postsid

How do you generate the post id for the post/page you are on?

The above is test code which I resorted to as couldn't get the post id for a function that uses code like this:


global $post;
$stmeta2011headeror = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'st_meta_2011header_or', true);


$post->ID isn't outputing anything if it's not within a template file like header.php. Replacing $post->ID with a posts id and loading that post works.

Seen quite a few support requests in the WordPress forums, but the general advice is add global $post; which I've tried.


Probably not relevant to the problem, but this is what I'm trying to do (detailed info)

Have a theme with a customized version of the TwentyEleven random header image code, basically rather than one set of 8 header images there's multiple sets of images that are selected via an options page (had this working for a while).

Trying to setup a custom field on post and page edit screens that allows the user to override the main header set (set on an options page) on a post by post basis. If I can get it to work there will be an option to select any of the sets that are part of the theme or child theme (this code is working, checks installed headers on the parent theme and child theme) meaning every post can have a different header set available to it when the random rotating feature is active (choose a header set and one of eight images are loaded at random from that set on that page only). I have this concept working for similar image features and a layout and colour scheme (the theme has 13 layouts and almost 30 colour schemes, every post can have a different layout and or colour scheme, it's working perfectly), but for the TwentyEleven code I'm having problems getting the post id within the code.

I have the code for the TwentyEleven header image code within an include file rather than directly within the functions.php file (though testing in functions.php failed as well).

Trying to use code like this within the include file


global $post;
$stmeta2011headeror = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'st_meta_2011header_or', true);


But $post->ID isn't generating the ID, replacing $post->ID with a posts ID (1 for example) results in the code working as expected when viewing post 1, so the only problem is obtaining the current posts ID (which should be easy) on an included PHP file.

Using this code within header.php


$stmeta2011headeror = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'st_meta_2011header_or', true);
echo $stmeta2011headeror;


Outputs the posts meta field entry.

I've tried 

$post->ID
$wp_query->post->ID
get_the_ID()

Confused :-)

header.php runs after $post has been defined.

Your include file runs before $post is defined.

The trick to make your include file function is to add it or its code with
an action that takes place after $post has been defined.

If header.php is okay, use add_action( 'wp_head', 'your_function' ) where
your function runs the code you want to add to the theme header.php file.

Or, if you need the post ID before then (but after at least the 'wp' hook),
use the function get_queried_object_id()

Hopefully, with so much of jQuery UI in core now, it shouldn't take me too
long to create something sufficient on a case by case basis. I'll leave the
idea here, as a slow burner, just in case :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] adding HTML to readme.txt
Message-ID: <87likzp34u.fsf@newcastle.ac.uk>




I am tryign to add raw HTML to me readme.txt. The reason for this is
that I want to add a span tag which contains CoiNS metadata to this
page, which my plugin itself can interpret. 

The section of my readme.txt looks like this.

---- START ----

A tool for producing citations and bibliographies in Wordpress posts.
Developed for the Knowledgeblog project (http://knowledgeblog.org).


<span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Adc&amp;rfr_id=copy-from-kblog-metadata.php&amp;rft.title=Kcite&amp;rft.source=Wordpress+Plugin&amp;rft.date=2012-05-11&amp;rft.identifier=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F2012%2F05%2F11%2Fkcite%2F&amp;rft.au=Phillip+Lord&amp;rft.au=Simon+Cockell&amp;rft.format=text&amp;rft.language=English"></span>

---- END ----

COinS metadata is not my invention, so please don't blame me for the
format! However, if I run markdown on this, it does the right thing:

---- START ----

<p>A tool for producing citations and bibliographies in Wordpress posts.
Developed for the Knowledgeblog project (http://knowledgeblog.org).</p>

<p><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Adc&amp;rfr_id=copy-from-kblog-metadata.php&amp;rft.title=Kcite&amp;rft.source=Wordpress+Plugin&amp;rft.date=2012-05-11&amp;rft.identifier=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F2012%2F05%2F11%2Fkcite%2F&amp;rft.au=Phillip+Lord&amp;rft.au=Simon+Cockell&amp;rft.format=text&amp;rft.language=English"></span></p>

---- END ----


However, with the readme.txt validator I either get no span tag at all,
or I get the an escaped span tag with entities everywhere and not an
angle bracket in site (er, sight), depending on whether I have the span
tag in a clear line of it's own or not. I have even tried adding php in
(which the example readme suggests you can do) and having it echo the
HTML. Didn't work. 

I am guessing that readme.txt is not actually parsed my markdown but
something related. Is it possible to include raw HTML in? Can anyone
point me to an example? 

Thanks

It is parsed by Markdown, but it's also passed through kses, which is 
most likely where the problem is arising.

I'm sure one of the WordPress.org guys can chime in about exactly what 
kses replaces, but it's roughly the same as wp_kses()

Message-ID: <25208085.1008.1336732646150.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@vbez20>

I'm trying to hold my plugins and themes mostly options free, as this saves 
me a lot of time (no need for activate/deactivate/uninstall + testing) and 
helps my users living with a slim database.

So here's what I tried: `add_theme_support( 'plugin_name', array( 'post', 
'custom_post_type' ) );`. That allows me to check the global, show/hide 
stuff, etc.

And here's the problem: That "feature" is not (yet) implemented [1].

So here's my idea for a workaround: Check the `global $post_type` (if set) 
or `$pagenow, $typenow, $hook_suffix` or something from the `
current_screen_object()` against `$_wp_theme_features['plugin_name'][0]`.

Q: Anyone got a better idea than doing it via a global?

Thanks!
Kaiser.

Ah. wp_kses should let it through (it allows span with class and title).
I will have to hope someone knows for sure, as doing this black box is
going to be a bit futile.

https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Plugin-Readme-Parser is the 
source, but it's quite out-of-date (I wrote my own, which is almost 
entirely compatible: https://github.com/rmccue/WordPress-Readme-Parser - 
it required reverse engineering some things). There's also further 
processing done after it's spit out of there, as far as I can tell.

Hopefully that might help though. :)

Can you explain what exactly it's used to achieve? (Sorry, The
wikipedia page didn't really help me understand what your use-case
is).
To be honest, from the sniplet of HTML you've given I wouldn't expect
that to be displayed verbatim, simply due to needing to control what
HTML is output to prevent plugins breaking things.

The bbPress plugin that powers the Plugin directory is open source:
http://plugins-svn.bbpress.org/svn-browser/trunk/
I unfortunately have a feeling that that's a bit out of date with
what's currently used, and I can't actually find the readme parser
there anymore, but there might be something there to help you.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using Media Library "selector" on user-edit page
Message-ID: <4FAD0412.3090100@gmail.com>

I've added a custom field text input to my user edit pages in the admin 
area, for an image.

At present the process is upload image to media library, get url, go to 
user edit, copy+paste URL into the correct text input.

I want to speed this up by opening the Media Library "selector", like 
you can in custom post types. I've used a common bit of code found while 
Googling for doing this, the Media Library selector opens, however 
throws the following error:

*Notice*: Undefined index: post_id in 
*C:\wamp\www\sprkle-com\trunk\httpdocs\wp-admin\includes\media.php* on 
line *1481
*
Obviously I suspect this is because I'm calling the Media Library 
selector from the user edit screen, rather than a post screen, but is 
there a way around this?

What's the correct way of opening the Media Library selcetor from the 
user edit screen?

Hi Rob,

I think you could simply send an empty post_id to the media-upload script :
tb_show('', 'media-upload.php?type=image&TB_iframe=true*&post_id*');
The warning won't show and you'll still get the functionality.

But maybe is there a better way to call this window, I can't tell.

Okay. It's a bit complicated, I am afraid. 

I have a wordpress plugin called kcite which generates academic
bibliographies to wordpress posts. So if I reference 

http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/2010/07/realism-and-science/
 
in a post, it will get replaced with this "(Lord et al 2010)" and I get
a reference list which looks like so:

Bibliography
...
Lord, Phillip. 2010. Realism and Science. An Exercise in Irrelevance.
July 28. http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/2010/07/realism-and-science/.
...

You can see this working at 

http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/2012/05/kcite-greycite-and-kblog-metadata/


To achieve this, kcite has to get it's bibliographic metadata from
somewhere. Currently, kcite uses several different sources for this
metadata, one of which is from the web page itself. In turn, this
requires that the end point of the link advertise it's metadata in a way
that kcite can understand. One of these ways is COiNS which, dreadful
though it is, is somewhat of a standard within the academic section of
the web. 

Now, if I reference my own plugin page at
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kcite, unfortunately, this page does
not advertise any metadata I can consume. So the reference appears as
"(Anon)" the bibliography displays:

Bibliography
....
Anon. . http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/kcite
....

Bit ugly. Also slightly unfortunate that kcite cannot present nicely a
reference to itself. The span tag that I sent in my original post
contains parsable metadata that would make this appear nice. I don't
need the span tag to be visible on the page, I just need it to be in the
source, exactly as is, not doing anything else.

It's in a subdirectory. Thanks I will take a look.

Okay, that was useful. Span tags are not, unfortunately, allowed in
readme.txt, AFAICK -- parse-readme.php contains. 


		$allowed = array(
			'a' => array(
				'href' => array(),
				'title' => array(),
				'rel' => array()),
			'blockquote' => array('cite' => array()),
			'br' => array(),
			'p' => array(),

			'strong' => array(),
			'ul' => array(),
			'ol' => array(),
			'li' => array(),
			'h3' => array(),
			'h4' => array()
		);

Which is unfortunate for me. Ah well. Think again. Thanks for the help.

Thanks for the idea, couldn't get it to work, but figured out why.

Since the code is within the TwentyEleven header image code which is 
enclosed within add_action( 'after_setup_theme', .... I couldn't get the 
post id in anyway within that code. Changing 'after_setup_theme' to 
'wp_head' allowed my original code to work.

Time to check the implications of this change on child themes as it looks 
like it was added so child themes could override the header images, probably 
not an issue for my theme as I have a way for child themes to override 
almost everything.

header.php runs after $post has been defined.

Your include file runs before $post is defined.

The trick to make your include file function is to add it or its code with
an action that takes place after $post has been defined.

If header.php is okay, use add_action( 'wp_head', 'your_function' ) where
your function runs the code you want to add to the theme header.php file.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Best Backup Plugin
Message-ID: <5501FBF4-18FE-48C2-933A-992CB49FDBD9@graymerica.com>

Can anyone tell me what they think is the best backup plugin.

I am looking for something with the following features.

1.  Reliably makes a DB backup.
2.  Exports files to Amazon / FTP / or another place and saves a local copy
3.  Is cheap or free.   (Vaultpress is too expensive for some of the clients)

What do you like?

thanks,

Andrew

Based on what David is doing, I'd suggest creating a template tag 
(function) in your functions.php file along the lines of:

function show_random_header_image(){

global $post;
$stmeta2011headeror = get_post_meta($post->ID, 'st_meta_2011header_or', 
true);

//do random image stuff

return $stmeta2011headeror;

}

then in your header.php template

use your function

<body>
...
<div id="header-image">
<?php echo show_random_header_image(); ?>
</div>
...

your REAL problem is not getting the $post ID. It's showing random image 
from a set for a post where it is possible to select specific header 
image set for a post.

Good thing you included your use case :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using symlinks in WP installations
Message-ID: <-3452139346768354099@unknownmsgid>

Hi all

I am wondering if there are likely to be any issues with using
symlinks to run multiple installs of WP from one set of core, plugin
and theme files, and thought it might be a good idea to post here.

I'm currently playing with a setup where everything in my DocumentRoot
directories are actually symlinks to a central install with the
exception of WP-content and .htaccess. Inside WP-content, both /themes
and /plugins are also symlinks.

I'm not really looking to this as a solution for production, but have
been playing around with it on a whole bunch of dev and staging sites.
Apart from running into file path related problems with some plugins,
everything seems fine. Can anyone foresee any problems hiding around
the corner waiting to bite me if all the appropriate constants are set
in WP-config?

Cheers
Neil

One issue is that when you upgrade plugin you may run into issues
where the database may need to be updated.

I run a similar setup as well, Common WordPress directory symlinked
into each site, I usually have a per-site content directory though.
One thing of note, is this:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16953

It's not that much effort to set up a single test site and see how you
go though.

Depends on web server settings, particularly on?FollowSymLinks

Yes, it definitely works and as Dion states having a separate wp-content 
directory solves several problems - including resolving conflicts with 
plugins that write cache or other files to the server.   Watch for that 
sort of conflict where one blog loads settings/information written by 
another blog.

Also be aware that lots of plugins make poor assumptions concerning
the location of files, and will thus just not work for no obvious
reason. Plugins that do things like "include
'../../../wp-config.php';" and similar, for example. Or plugins that
try to save things directly into the wp-content directory. And so
forth.

I was using orderby => author in WP_Query, and wondering why I was 
getting a strange order.

Then I suddenly twigged - it's sorting by Author ID, rather than Author 
Name.

How would you order by Author Display Name, rather than ID, within WP_Query?

Thanks,

Thanks everyone for this. I fully expected some problems with __FILE__
but plugins (and themes in some cases ) keeping their own caches
within their directory hadn't occured to me yet - nothing
insurmountable though.

My main concern was that there might be a problem running core in this
manner, doesn't seem to be the case.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Thoughts on Softpedia and PHPKode Directories?
Message-ID: <4FB100AE.902@jacksonwhelan.com>

Recently after releasing a new plugin, I received messages from 
webscripts.softpedia.com and phpkode.com, congratulating me on having my 
plugin included in their directory.

I went to check it out, and while it seems benign, I am leery of them 
hosting my plugin archive - which seems to remove some of the control I 
have over distribution and making sure that the most current version is 
what is downloaded. It's unclear how and when changes I make to the 
official WordPress.org repository get applied to their hosted version.

I imagine they are scraping the new plugin releases from WordPress.org 
and using them to create more content on their site.

Personally, I'd prefer to channel everything through one distribution 
channel, and have asked to have the plugin removed.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Curious to hear what others 
have done or think of this.

Thanks in advance,

Jackson

Had the same but through a google alert - found my plugin, a few days after adding to the repo, also on their servers.

As long as they are crediting the right people, leave all files intact and not charging I see no problem with it.
That said, I didn't dig too deeply.

I received the same notices. Several places mirror our files in this
manner. We don't really have the power to stop them, given that the
files are GPL they're allowed to copy and redistribute and so forth. I
think it's relatively benign. Somebody installing these will do update
checks through .org as per normal, and get notified of the newer
versions like everybody else.

Display name is stored in the usermeta table and not in posts. I suspect
the simplest way would be to filter the query to:

   -  add the usermeta table to FROM
   - in WHERE add that posts.post_author = usermeta.user_id
   AND usermeta.meta_key = 'display_name'
   - ORDER BY usermeta.meta_value

Something along those lines anyway. Maybe someone has worked this out
already but I doubt it's in any of the core functions as it's pretty niche.
Seems hard to imagine why you'd really need these results anyway. Why not
get a list of users, then show one post for each of them? That seems like a
more logical way to go, as you'll have to write some weird code to add
headings with usernames to the results of the query you're looking for
above.

Thanks for the replies.

I will give them this - my request for removal was handled promptly by 
both sites.

It's just much simpler for me to monitor one location for support 
requests and bug reports. From what I could see they included no links 
to the appropriate support forum, leaving users to post comments on 
their listing pages looking for help.

Also, I have complete confidence that the download from WP.org will be 
exactly the code I've provided. However, I have no assurances that their 
download package hasn't been modified in anyway.

Thanks - Jackson

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP_Query and orderby - outside of WP
Message-ID: <CAAFBVjiUZi=qyOdEe6To6p4YynDbf6+YxmZ1O87XLdn3mSO9Cw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a regular PHP script that bootstraps WordPress by including
wp-load.php (as previously discussed on this list).

I'm doing something relatively simply --

a) loading WP
b) grabbing posts of a certain custom post type

I'd like to change the orderby, but no matter what I pick for orderby,
the posts come back in the same order (ie. date).

Here's my code:

--

global $wp_the_query, $wp_query, $wp_rewrite, $wp;
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
require_once('/home/wheaton/public_html/wp-load.php');
$quilts = new WP_Query('post_type=profiles&post_status=publish&orderby=rand' );
while ( $quilts->have_posts() ) : $quilts->the_post();
// etc

--

In short, changing the orderby parameter has no effect. ie. title, rand, etc.

What could be causing this? Might it have to do with bootstrapping WP
in this way?

Doc: http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query

Thanks-
Bill

I don't see an orderyby just an order.  You have to define that you want to
orderby title or date or whatever


'orderby' => 'title', 'order' => 'DESC'

All,
  I am sure this has been asked/discussed before but I am wondering what the best way to control the URL of a paginated archive page.  I.E:

Current: www.wordpressrocks.com/author/ryan/page/2
Should Be: www.wordpressrocks.com/author/ryan/2
OR: www.wordpressrocks.com/author/ryan/* (where * is anything I can dream up)

I can have `paginate_links` output the Should Be URL easy enough but I am unclear how to change the actual permalink.

As an aside, if I modify the output of `get_pagenum_link` will that have the effect I am looking for?

I can only imagine that this has been discussed/wanted a million times over and any input anyone has would be much appreciated.

You'd definitely want to make sure that absolutely no user has one of the
roles you are deleting, as well as checking that the default role was one
of your newly created ones.

You will also run into issues with any plugins that assume roles rather
than capabilities when doing checks. I'd recommend keeping the
administrator role for the admin user just in case.

You'd probably want to filter the get_editable_roles() call
('editable_roles' filter). That will stop the unwanted roles from showing
up in wp_dropdown_roles() etc. without completely erasing them out of the
system (which is probably better than removing them completely just in
case).

Is there anything wrong with doing something along the following to get the result I am looking for?
- - -
add_action( 'init', 'my_permalinks_func' )l
function my_permalinks_func() {
	global $wp_rewrite;
	$wp_rewrite->pagination_base = ''
}
- - -
Then flush the rules.

ALSO, is there a preferred way to change the Author Permalink from ending with {nicename} to {first_name} (or whatever)?  

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.  If there is any documentation or standard procedure for these types of rewrites that would be awesome to.

Thanks,
Ryan

That's the correct way to change the pagination base.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to check if a plugin has been removed from
	wordpress and why
Message-ID: <D6AC4C43-655E-4A24-9F07-A13C9D3A7CB4@cspath.com>

Today, I found that my plugin page on wordpress.org is not working - "We couldn't find that plugin."
I think my plugin may have been removed from WordPress but I am not sure.
I can see the plugin when I login with my username (that's the administrator account for the plugin) but all contributors cannot see the plugin.
The email I used when I registered on wordpress has been deactivated and I had to reactivate it this morning so if any message has been sent to that email it 
has probably bounced back :/
Who can I contact to find out if my plugin has been removed from wordpress and how can I find out the reason that my plugin has been removed.
I've always tried to follow the plugin guidelines as listed on wordpress.org
I am sorry if this is not the correct mail list to send this question to, if so please point me to the right place.

Yes! That`s so. Now I know that should look for "svn client", :S

Short answer is:

// multiple tag doesnt work domain.com/tag/tag-tag2.html
 from: loop-tag.php

Doesn't work because /tag/tag-tag2.html doesn't resolve any posts, and
therefor, the 404 handler/templates are used.

Don't use new WP_Query like that, use pre_get_posts or parse_request
and filter the values there instead, that will allow your mail
WP_Query to contain the correct data and not load the 404 handler
unless the initial query doesn't match any posts.

The two tags being used, are in separate posts.

So ?tag=tag1,tag2 works

Just not with the -


Will try using pre_get_posts

The 2 tags may be in use, by no posts have the tag 'tag-tag2', which
is what your request is actually asking for.

You need to understand how WordPress parses requests in order to
understand what's going on:

 1. WordPress is loaded
 2. The rewrite rules are applied
 3. The results form the rewrite rules (the query vars) are loaded
 4. The Query is executed using those rewrite rules
    4a. If no posts are found for the query, 404 template is selected,
continue to 6
    4b. If posts are found, continue to 5
 5. The Request type is determined for the template to use,
is_archive() is_taxonomy(), is_single(), etc.
 6. The Template is loaded and the loop starts.

Your code is running after this so:
 7. The Template is executed, and a new WP_Query is made with the alterations.

Since 7 is within a template, 4b must be chosen, so there has to be
posts for the ORIGINAL query vars, WordPress doesn't know about your
custom alterations until it loads the template, and it may never load
the template if it didn't find posts to start with.

The best way, as suggested, is to use pre_get_posts to hook in between
steps 3 and 4, you can edit the request there, you'll need to limit
the WP_Query instances you modify though, so for that, have a look at
the details in the following presentation by Nacin:

http://www.slideshare.net/andrewnacin/you-dont-know-query-wordcamp-netherlands-2012
specifically, slides 49 onwards (but please, read it all, or watch the
presentation if you can find it online - I didn't look hard and didn't
see it)

The display name is in fact stored in the users table, not the user
meta table. Using 'orderby' => 'display_name' should have the desired
effect.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Two URLs - One WP Install? (And the silly way
 WordPress stores full URLs in the database)
Message-ID: <4FB4CD67.4090700@gmail.com>

Hello,

We're setting up a mobile version of a website we run. We decided to do 
this by creating a mobile specific template.

However we'd quite like to switch the URL to a mobile version of the site:

E.g.
-> normal visitor reaches the site, and stays at http://www.example.com
-> mobile visitor reaches the site, and gets redirected to 
http://m.example.com

Behind the scenes, the only difference between the two is the template 
picked. It's the same blog + DB.

I get how to do the template switching etc ... but how do I get 
WordPress to answer on http://m.example.com and stop redirecting all 
requests back to the www....?

Also, I now have to do a find and replace on ALL the urls in the 
database everytime the mobile site is loaded, for that site, to map to 
http://m.example.com ... Why does WordPress do this! Why not just keep 
the content as content! And let us decide what wrappers we want to put 
around it!

Cheers,
Rob.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Change theme per user / mobile
Message-ID: <4FB4E7E7.8080108@gmail.com>

Is there an action/filter to change the WordPress theme per user / onload?

Not switch_theme (I don't want to change it for everyone), just to 
change it for certain users, sometimes ...

I'm using the following two filters:
add_filter('template', 'mobile_theme_name');
add_filter('stylesheet', 'mobile_theme_name');

Which seem to update the StyleSheet path and Image paths to use the new 
theme, however WordPress is still loading the physical *.php (index.php, 
front-page.php, home.php etc) files from the *database* set themes 
folder, and not the new themes folder.

Obviously I'm missing a filter/action somewhere.

Thanks,
Rob.

If you're filtering it on the admin, you might end up with the
alternate value saved in the database (Or at least, that's all I can
think of).

The 3.4 Customizer switches themes on the fly, The first 5 filters in
this function( WP_Customize::start_previewing_theme()) are probably
needed in your case:

Those filters work, but at the moment, not everything is converted to 
use them. Things which still use TEMPLATEPATH and STYLESHEETPATH won't 
work: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18298

Unfortunately, it means there's no good way to ensure that a different 
theme is loaded.

The 2 tags may be in use, by no posts have the tag 'tag-tag2', which is what
your request is actually asking for.

You need to understand how WordPress parses requests in order to understand
what's going on:

 1. WordPress is loaded
 2. The rewrite rules are applied
 3. The results form the rewrite rules (the query vars) are loaded  4. The
Query is executed using those rewrite rules
    4a. If no posts are found for the query, 404 template is selected,
continue to 6
    4b. If posts are found, continue to 5  5. The Request type is determined
for the template to use,
is_archive() is_taxonomy(), is_single(), etc.
 6. The Template is loaded and the loop starts.

Your code is running after this so:
 7. The Template is executed, and a new WP_Query is made with the
alterations.

Since 7 is within a template, 4b must be chosen, so there has to be posts
for the ORIGINAL query vars, WordPress doesn't know about your custom
alterations until it loads the template, and it may never load the template
if it didn't find posts to start with.

The best way, as suggested, is to use pre_get_posts to hook in between steps
3 and 4, you can edit the request there, you'll need to limit the WP_Query
instances you modify though, so for that, have a look at the details in the
following presentation by Nacin:

http://www.slideshare.net/andrewnacin/you-dont-know-query-wordcamp-netherlan
ds-2012
specifically, slides 49 onwards (but please, read it all, or watch the
presentation if you can find it online - I didn't look hard and didn't see
it)

Subject: [wp-hackers] paginate_links() empty href in some cases -> bug or
	feature?
Message-ID: <CAF_HY=oq+5_xhg=jYAQBgiu4DNRgRTB8CDaqYRJ9Guq=bKRaXA@mail.gmail.com>

On the definition of the paginate_links() in
wp-includes/general-template.php<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.3.2/wp-includes/general-template.php#L1921>,
i see that it gives $link an empty value on at least two cases:

If $current page is number 2 (lines 1954-55)

if ( $prev_next && $current && 1 < $current ) :


        $link = str_replace('%_%', 2 == $current ? '' : $format, $base);

and during the for loop, if $n == 1 (lines 1968-69)

if ( $show_all || ( $n <= $end_size || ( $current && $n >= $current -
$mid_size && $n <= $current + $mid_size ) || $n > $total - $end_size )
) :


                $link = str_replace('%_%', 1 == $n ? '' : $format, $base);

After that, it goes on to formatting the now empty string, adds whatever is
on the 'add_args' and 'add_fragment' inputs and  builds the array of links.

Can anyone point me the reasons for that? Should i bother dive into it to
try and make it work or is it really designed to work like this?

ps.:
I've posted a complete summary of my troubles with paginate_links yesterday
at WPSE
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/52405/paginate-links-adds-empty-href-to-first-page-and-previous-link
but
still can't get around to it.

Also, i'm not a really experienced developer, so i might have misread
something on that code... but it just seems to me that paginate_links is
*this* close to working seamlessly with WP_Query, but not quite there yet.
 =\

thanks!

Yes, only plugins have activation hooks.

There have been on/off discussions about adding something similar for
themes over the years: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7795

Subject: [wp-hackers] permalinks
Message-ID: <CAHERW=3Xwi=f60r288JQ1NMCjbPwuC-w874KTB0TuSKwbUdQbg@mail.gmail.com>

How do I change the posts to have 'articles' base in front of the
%post-name% witohut effecting url on the rest of the site?


category base: category
sample url :   mysite.com/category/featured-videos

I wanted to prefix all my posts with /articles/ base in front of it.

So I went to the permalinks screen and set up a custom structure as follows

/articles/%post-name%

that fixed the posts url to be the way I want.

but then all of a sudden the url what used to be

mysite.com/category/featured-videos

become

mysite.com/articles/category/featured-videos

Is there a way to get the bosy of both worlds that is

keep the rest of the non-post url as is ( so that category urls work
the way you expect them work ) and have control over the posts url
base?

Thanks, I will try some apps out there. I just find Tortoise very sluggish

What would be the best way to go about, finding the amount of posts for
multiple tags.

I will be using it on a tag archive page.

        $tag_count = get_term_by('name', get_query_var('tag'),'post_tag');
        echo $tag_count->count;

this works fine for one tag, but I want to check via tag1,tag2,tag3 and
tag1+tag2+tag3 how many posts match those

In order to do that, you'd have to make a new WP_Query, query for the
tag intersections, probably limit it to 1 post, and look at the total
count it returns. You could save memory/query time by only asking for
the ids of the posts too.
You'd want to store the counts in a cache somehow, a transient would
probably suit best.

Of course, that's just my suggestion without resolving to using custom SQL.

Dion's right, there's no way to do it without some extra work. This plugin generates tag clouds based on the results of the current search or browse:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/scriblio/

Perhaps that's similar to what you're trying to do?

Actually I just used $wp_query->post_count;

Works fine, on the tag.php template

I missed the fact you were doing it on the Tag page, so yes, Using
$wp_query->post_count is the right way to do it (And the last step in
my suggestion:))

Subject: [wp-hackers] ajax and posts
Message-ID: <CABYasnB-K_2Gu=cetcp-ysQHHWAJAefoX5R=_nwR-bCWZ3tszg@mail.gmail.com>

I have been trying to figure this one out for a while, but to no avail.

How can I I retrieve posts via ajax? Specifically, I would like to click a
button on a page, which would send an ajax request to another page which
has a custom loop and get the results back and spit them out. Also, do I
have to load the wordpress environment manually on the page I am requesting
from(So that the loop will work)?

Thank you in advance!

There are specific hooks built-in to WordPress for handling ajax requests
whether you're on the front or backside of things. Check out the following
links for some information in to them. The WPSE link may put you on the
right path as it seems to be a working example close to what you're trying
to do.

This plugin may do what you want, or you might At least get some ideas from it:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bcms/

Two features to be aware of:

+ Wijax allows you to deliver any widget via ajax. You can lazy load the widget or fetch widgets from different sites. It adds a new endpoint to the perms link structure so that you can go to any post  permalink, add /wijax/encoded_name and get widgets relevant for that context. 

+ the post loop widget puts all the power if WP's post loop into a widget. You can get WP's default post for the given URL/permalink, select posts related to the default posts, or select an entirely different set of posts. 

Together, you can deliver a post or set of posts via ajax.

I do this all of the time using the following example as a launching point:

http://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins

Be sure to include the ajaxurl value in the user-facing page.  The
wp_ajax_nopriv action works great for this.

BackupBuddy meets #1 and #2 hands-down.  It's free-ish -- it's a premium
plugin, and considering how mercurial individual WP installs can be it's
worth paying for the license and support.

+1 for BackupBuddy and definitely check ManageWP as well - its SaaS (or
PaaS) and could be a great fit for you.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Advanced taxonomy queries
Message-ID: <CAFCnrFjibupb7uKAPQTR+eXiVbyM1uNinL-zY14VJi2OGfMXWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a custom post with 3 taxonomies ( Country, State, City ) I can get
the terms for a single taxonomy using "get_terms( $taxonomy )".

But let's say  that i want to get the terms in the taxonomy "state", but
that the taxonomy 'country' is equal to 'X'

And later search for the cities that the state is equal to Y and country
equal to X.

i have been reading the docs but i can't find something that help me.

Any suggestions?

Best Regards!

I'm doing something similar for a client site.  This is the function I'm 
using in the theme:

function get_intersected_terms($tax_from, $term_from, $tax_to) {
     global $wpdb;

     $term_from = get_term_by('name', $term_from, $tax_from);

     $query = "
         SELECT term_id FROM {$wpdb->term_taxonomy} WHERE taxonomy = 
'{$tax_to}' AND term_taxonomy_id IN (
             SELECT term_taxonomy_id FROM {$wpdb->term_relationships} 
WHERE object_id IN (
                 SELECT object_id FROM {$wpdb->term_relationships} WHERE 
term_taxonomy_id = {$term_from->term_taxonomy_id}
             )
         )
     ";

     $term_ids = $wpdb->get_col($query);

     if (empty($term_ids))
         return array();

     return get_terms($tax_to, array('include' => $term_ids));
}

In the template file, I'm calling the function like this:

$showlist = get_intersected_terms('seasons', $current_season, 'shows');

$current_season is a theme option in this case.  From here, I'm using a 
foreach loop to walk through the list (which you may or may not need).

Hope this helps.

hi there,

in my plugin i am using javascript function tb_show() to use standard
wordpress image uplader, as described here:

http://www.webmaster-source.com/2010/01/08/using-the-wordpress-uploader-in-your-plugin-or-theme/

works great. but i want to change something in files uploaded this way
(if you ask what: i want to encode file content using my 'secret'
function).

which hook should i use to do it?

and pro-question: how to recognise in hook action/filter that file
which i attempt to encode if file uploaded via my plugin? i want to
encode only files uploaded in my plugin. if someone will upload
regular attachment to post (ie image inserted into post content) file
shouldn't be encoded

Message-ID: <CAC3yCwraJwto3LadKH8QY_AAUjW2TH0VxZciqe07gy0sCF3E+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Background:  I have a plugin that I wrote to replace another widget that is
missing features. The problem is that I need to programmatically replace
the widget with the new one. I wrote a function that replaces them that
hooks on the 'admin_init'. I picked that because it runs after the widgets
are loaded. I wanted to be able to use the functions such
as get_settings(), save_settings(), wp_get_sidebars_widgets(),
and wp_set_sidebars_widgets(). I guess I could have done all this before
the widgets were loaded, but I already have it working this way... but 1
problem.

Problem: The widget does not display the form properly on the page load
when the widget switch happens. The widget's ['callback'] property when it
gets set to 'wp_widget_control' returns false with is_callable(). This
makes the widget settings empty. When viewing the other widgets objects
that weren't converted, they have the same properties, but it returns true.
I can't figure out the difference. I'm guessing that my widget's object
isn't initialized properly. I've been looking through the WP source, and I
can't figure out what is wrong. Is there a way to do a new init of a widget
object later?

I know this isn't that big of a problem because on the 2nd page load it all
loads properly because it is now saved in the database. It is just really
bothering me because I can't figure out how to do it. It also is very
confusing to the user because it feels like things broke until they reload
the page.

Any tips or suggestions?

Thanks,
Matt

Here is my code if it helps:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Add same widget to multiple sidebars
Message-ID: <4FBF735D.9090509@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi folks,

in my template I have multiple sidebars, one for the homepage, one for 
the archive page, and so on. Each of them has a different set of widgets 
in it, but some widgets should be shared among sidebars. I've written 
the usual code

function my_widget(){

}
wp_register_sidebar_widget(...)

But as soon as I assign a widget to a sidebar, it disappears from the 
list of available filters, making it unavailable for other sidebars. I 
see the Text Widget, though, can be reused multiple times. I've found a 
few different ways of doing this, but I'd like to ask this list about 
what's the 'final' and best way of making a 'reusable' widget.

Thanks folks,
Dino.

If you use the new Widgets API (That means extending the WP_Widget
class) then you should automagically get multi-instance.
See http://codex.wordpress.org/Widgets_API#Developing_Widgets for details

Thanks, Dion, it worked like a charm :) The reason why I asked is 
because at the top of that page it says that "This article is marked as

Have a wonderful weekend!

Instead of mucking with the widget factory, you should attempt to prevent
the other widget from being registered at all, by calling remove_filter()
at the appropriate time.

Then, register your own widget with the old widget's ID.

Oh, and if you're going to "impersonate" the other widget, you could just
show a notice, asking users to deactivate the other plugin.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to prevent "You do not have sufficient permissions
	to access this page."
Message-ID: <CAMg3evEupRzaVJLgpotBOfQiVd0aNP8nMSwTPgEXOUy4_79LJg@mail.gmail.com>

I am doing some work on a plugin which has its functionality spread across
a number of files (e.g. form in one file, form processing in another).
 What is the recommended way to "register" the pages such that I won't get
the "You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page." error
message when landing on the processing page?

Adding a menu registers the form page and there is no problem navigating to
it.  Submitting the form invokes the second file which is not registered
with the menu therefore does not have a slug nor is it in the
"$_registered_pages" variable which results in the permissions error.  If I
register a menu with a slug for the form processing page it works fine but
clutters up the menu and doesn't make sense from a UI perspective.

The only solution I've come up with so far is to modify the
$_registered_pages variable like this:

    $hookname = get_plugin_page_hookname('myplugin-process-form-page', '') ;
    add_action($hookname, 'myplugin_process_form_page');
    $_registered_pages[$hookname] = true;

I then define the wrapper function 'myplugin_process_form_page' which does
nothing more than include the PHP file with the form processing code and
the action attribute on the form is
action="admin.php?page=myplugin-process-form-page".

Is there a better way?  Is there a "register page" function that I am
missing?  Is there a way to add a menu item such that it isn't visible but
registers the page so it works correctly?

Thanks,

Mike

I'd suggest one of 2 things:
 1. Use admin-post.php for callbacks, and redirect back to the plugin
page afterwards
or
 2. Register the pages you need, and use the load-<pagehook> action to
process form events from that page. The load hook is run before any
admin template code is run.

I'm not sure if I'm missing something here though :)

One other ramification of the functionality being split across PHP files,
the Admin menu doesn't stay expanded because the "current" page isn't part
of the menu.  The more I think about, the more I think I should combine the
functionality but as this isn't my plugin, I am trying to limit how much of
it I change.

Just to clarify, if I use admin-post.php, I need to add a nonce to the URL,
correct?

Ive seen people use these

admin_print_styles
admin_print_scripts

and

wp_print_styles
wp_print_scripts

and just

init

and just

wp_enqueue_scripts

which is the best way to go about it?

Use admin_enqueue_scripts to enqueue both scripts and styles on the backend.

Enqueue styles and scripts is he right way doing I also would prefere.
But the most common mistake made at attaching additional scripts and style
is:

- polluting all admin pages with scripts only intended for frontend
- polluting all admin pages with admin intended script but only for few
plugin based pages

So you should also write conditional tests, wether you are producing a front
page output and skip enqueue of admin scripts. You should also test, if your
are at admin pages and avoid frontend enqueue.
Furthermore you should also separate by conditional tests, if your
plugin/theme page is about to be shown at backend and enqueue your admin
scripts only, if your page is about to be rendered!

Most incompatibilities of plugins are forced by polluting the entired admin
pages with scripts never intended for all admin pages.

It would be best to send a nonce no matter where you're posting the data to.
you shouldn't ever simply rely on a cap check, you should use a cap
check to make sure the user is allowed to do it, and a nonce check to
make sure the user actually requested it.

Can you point me to an example that uses admin-post.php?  I have been
unable to find one nor can I find a reference to it within WordPress itself.

I played around with it a bit this afternoon and while it appears to work,
I am missing something fundamental because I am missing everything but the
"wrap" DIV on my rendered pages.

Sorry for not being clearer, Neither of what I suggested was for
-displaying- data, both were for processing the data received, I may
have mis understood part of your original question.

If you're simply looking to be able to display different page contents
under the one admin menu, i'd simply be doing something similar to
this:

add_settings_page(......., 'page-slug-here', 'function_to_call');
function function_to_call() {

$action = isset( $_REQUEST['action'] ) ? $_REQUEST['action'] : false;

switch ( $action ) {
   default:
      standard_plugin_page_content();
      break;
  case 'action2':
      include 'file2.php';
      action2_page_output();
      break;
   case 'action4':
       .....
     break;
}
}

If you're outputting data on file inclusion, wrap it in a function
instead to make it easier.

I am currently building an API to fetch posts based on category via AJAX and will need to check users permissions before to make sure they can access the requested content.  Can someone lend some insight on how to send the cookie with AJAX or another way of accessing the data that is appropriate to the user based on permissions.

Please note the permissions will be based on s2 Membership Plugin function.

Hello all,

I'm working on a plugin that has 'boxes' that can be hidden through the 
Screen Options dropdown. In order to display the most recent data inside 
each of them, I'd like a javascript function to be triggered as soon as 
the 'box' is set to visible. Is there anything I can leverage to achieve 
this? (other than hooking my function to 'onchange' on the checkbox)

Thanks,
Dino

The cookies are sent automatically with each AJAX request, so you can use
the same checks you would use normally.

Also note that if the user isn't logged in, the wp_ajax_nopriv_{action}
will be fired instead.

Thanks for respond! 
I did find out about cookies. It's cool that you mentioned about wp_ajax_nopriv_{action} this is exactly what I need,

function, only giving it the appropriate short description and known param
types and not messing with any code? Are there any guidelines on commenting
on other people's functions?

thanks! :)

I'm having trouble with some images that I have in widgets not showing up in IE8.

Here's the code from one of the widgets that isn't showing the image.

<a href="http://www.executivecoachinguniversity.com/landing?a_aid=4f734011d1f9e&amp;a_bid=e225f893"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4009" title="ECU" src="http://174.132.166.93/~newpath1/consciousnessisconfidence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ECU.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>

What am I doing wrong? And yes, that is a temporary src address and the numbers will be gone when the site goes into production. In the meantime, I have several of these dang images not showing up in IE8. Works fine in IE6 & 7, as well as 9 (according to Adobe's Browser Labs).

Thanks for your assistance.

Absolutely ? just submit a ticket to http://core.trac.wordpress.org under
the "Inline Documentation" component.

We always like phpdoc fixes and additions.

Hello,

We've been working on a stand-alone web server for doing WordPress 
development without having to mess around with Apache. It's made life 
easier for us, and so we decided to release it and see if it's useful to 
anyone else. From the readme:

Would be great to hear what people think!

Cheers,

Harry

I think it sounds really cool. Will it also give access to WordPress core,
allowing me to do core hacking and then output a diff when I'm done, or
quickly revert to base if I screw up?

Not quite sure what you mean.

If you run Whippet from the root of a WordPress install with a working 
database, all the WordPress core stuff works the same way as it would 
normally. Though by default Whippet doesn't display much information 
about what the core is doing (check out --show-wp-* or --show-everything 
if you want to see that).

If you run Whippet from a wp-content without a core, Whippet will 
download and stash the core files in ~/.cache. You could modify them 
there if you wanted to. Those modifications would then apply to any site 
you launch using Whippet from a wp-content. That might be useful or 
annoying!

Whippet won't produce a diff, or anything like that. Though if you 
screwed up you could delete the core from ~/.cache and Whippet would 
re-download it.

Me too, and without PHP integrated ... what's the point then?

Yeah, sorry about that. Windows support is definitely something we'd 
like to implement. If there's enough demand, we will certainly do it.

For the moment, you might be able to get it working reasonably easily 
using Cygwin.

Sorry :(

Well -- lots of people develop on macs and and under Linux :)

I'm not familiar with people's workflow on Windows. If we had Windows 
support, would it be workable to use Whippet from a command prompt, or 
would people expect it to run in its own window?

huh. Fascinating...

So is this basically a PHP based webserver?

Yup. It uses the built-in webserver in PHP 5.4 to actually serve pages. 
There's also quite a lot of other stuff that goes on to make sure that 
requests get routed to the right place, and to display useful 
information in the terminal.

It'll display all the requests, template logic, parameters, queries, 
hook callbacks, etc - as that stuff happens. Although you need to tell 
it what you want to see, because showing everything is usually way too 
much output to be useful. (Check out whippet --help)
