Yep. We're absolutely reluctant to change a lot of things. Sometimes it
takes years for there to be enough traction and buy-in for something. But
that isn't necessarily a negative. In fact, it is often a positive. We may
sometimes move slowly, and sometimes too slowly for some tastes (including
my own), but we do move in the right direction.

I don't think it is a stretch to say WordPress has *not* gotten worse over
time, and that the things that bother you the most are most likely
long-standing issues. (And some of them run up against design decisions
that may or may not evolve over time.)

Footnote: Obviously, not all WordPress core developers work at Automattic.
A majority of committers do not, a majority of patches come from those who
do not, those leading WordPress 3.6 do not, and many of our top
contributors do not. But, an awful lot of those who do not work at
Automattic have worked on major WordPress projects and deployments,
including many, many WordPress.com VIP clients. And, of course, the folks
at Automattic and WordPress.com have a particularly unique and important
perspective when it comes to scaling and deployment.

In my case: I don't do client work, but I do happen to maintain both the
jquery.com and wordpress.org networks, in a development role and
occasionally an operations role, and I have previously done consulting for
well-known media organizations.

And sometimes they are not edge cases, but we just disagree with you. It
happens. Not everything can or should be in core. The project's
philosophies guide us to build opinionated software. Please understand that
if we don't agree with you or your idea, it isn't hostility. We sometimes
make decisions that no, we don't want to add X to core, or no, we don't
want to be responsible for maintaining Y after it lands, or no, we don't
consider Z to be a priority. (Or to put it more bluntly: we respect that
you care about Z, but we simply don't.) Bottom line ? some tickets are
stalled for good reasons. (Obviously, there are a lot of stalled tickets
that have gotten lost ? we're working on making that better, I promise.)

In the case of post relationships, based on discussions at the Community
Summit in October, it's on a long-term roadmap (subject to change). There
are a lot of things we identified that need to happen first. We can dive in
after 3.6. In the meantime, *you can use a plugin* (scribu's posts-to-posts
is awesome) and I fail to see why that is not an adequate answer. I'm sorry
you care so much about Z, but I have A through W on my mind right now.

Also, others are right in stating that plugin code quality is bad. Help us
make it better by contributing to the documentation efforts at
http://make.wordpress.org/docs/ and in #wordpress-sfd on freenode.

What you'd just explained is it takes a lot of time and effort and politicking to get patches posted to Trac to make their way to fixes in core.  And there are not many people who can devote that much time.

And that was effectively what I was saying, that posting a patch to Trac is far from sufficient regarding the resolution of issues people may have. This is not me making a judgment about the process (in this context), I'm only pointing out for the benefit of newer people who might be lead to believe others that simply posting a patch to Trac is not a panacea which I posted because of:

> If it's benefit an user indirectly it still benefit the user. 

True. But I've been told many times by members of the WordPress core team they won't adding an API unless a feature being added to WordPress core depend that API.  

This is unfortunately one of the few places in which I believe Drupal has a leg up on WordPress, their embrace of empowering APIs.

> Deployment is easy to talk about but in the next releases WordPress has other things to fix first.

I only mentioned deployment, as an example, because it was an issue Harry mentioned. 

> Not saying it isn't important but there are other priorities.

I have no issue with setting and following priorities.  

Speaking of which, a public roadmap would allow known priorities to be known by more than a few people and probably ease a lot of frustration. (Personally I'm mostly over the frustration at this point and resigned to the state of affairs, I commented because I believe my doing so help others newer to the list understand.)

> CPT is a bad example. That was really needed.

It is a great example because it illustrates the tremendous value an API can have, which is why I mentioned it.

> See a fresh new API for themes and Image handling. Indirectly they benefit from it but hard to say how.

Those were added AFAICT only because there was an end-user feature being added that needed the API.

> The example of posts relationship is also something that is a bad example. 

Again, not a bad example. The fact is that I submitted the ticket 3 years ago and rather than have the team recognize the need many people who didn't understand the use-case explained:

"This seems to be straightforward plugin territory to me. Fairly niche use, etc." - Really? I hope I don't have to explain why that comment was shortsighted.

"We already have many-to-many relationships between posts. You can relate a bunch of posts to other posts by simply giving them all the same term in a taxonomy"  - I objected to this as being unworkable in practice yet that was the line the core team stuck with at the time. Note that Post2Posts recognized how unworkable taxonomy was and moved away a long time ago. 

"There's no point in creating the table if we don't provide UI ... to go with it." - There's that "We can only add something that is backed by a feature we are including" which means only APIs that support features that are needed for core additions can be added.

This ticket was a great case-study in the core team not having the experience (at the time) to recognize the needs expressed in the ticket yet being quick to dismiss the experience of people who had real world experience they did not.

> A lot of people want to include that in core but still a lot of things to be dealt earlier. See the amount of open tickets. Adding features does not reduce that.

I would be interested to know what types of open tickets are a critical path to object relationships?

Or is it a case of simply there being many tickets and so only so much bandwidth? 

If the latter then the solution (for a need of this magnitude) is to bless a team of people who have the need and commission them to build and test the features, maybe even over a period of several releases, instead of just ignoring the requirement for 3-5 years. I am certain that for features like this all that would be needed would be for the core team to ask.

> Also it's lame to attack me personally without mentioning of tickets.

Do you not recognize the irony of your telling Harry "The issue is that you think in "I" and not in WordPress user base in general", which you evidently did not see as lame, and your calling me lame for pointing out that everyone has their own "I" perspective and that maybe it's a good idea to consider your own "I" perspective before admonishing someone else for theirs?

> Obviously you will find more tickets that I say that it should be closed then it should be opened.

And that's one of the things I have noticed, that rather than try to understand a reporter's needs I have gotten a strong impression over many tickets that you have been quick to dismiss their experiences as irrelevant, and I think that approach does harm to the community.

> Also it is my opinion about how people using it and I can be wrong. That doesn't mean that I can't tell my opinion about it. That would be lame.

So you must also agree that it would be lame to want me to not tell my opinion. But that seems to be what you are implying, that I should hold my opinions, no?

> And as far as my memory goes you mean 1 particular ticket that you disagreed on. And in the end it got closed because more people agreed on that.

Has nothing to do with that one ticket and I'm disappointed that you would try to make this about a single ticket of mine. I don't ever remember the one to which you refer.  

I'm subscribed to the Trac firehose, so I see a lot of tickets when I have time to watch them and my impressions came collectively from what I saw reading them, most of which I do not comment on. 

I almost didn't mention this but since you implied my point was invalid because I was just upset about my ticket I decided to scan recent tickets and found many over the last four month that are good examples (note I did not report nor participate in on any of these tickets):

What's my point here?  I'd simply like to see people who try to participate given more respect. Snap judgements for ticket closure without first making sure the ticket is understood can lead to a lot of discontent in the community, some of which is being evidenced by this thread.

The funny part is that the third ticket you posted there could have been
solved by a post relationship table.

Then go use Drupal. We don't wish to adopt APIs that we do not use, for a
number of reasons. I hate the idea of accepting responsibility for
maintaining something that we do not actually use. Drupal does not keep
backwards compatibility for their APIs, which means they can experiment a
bit more. Our philosophies dictate that we need to take less of a burden
and less debt.

I would agree. It's in progress.

Image handling was added because IM generates better images than GD. It
paired nicely with end-user media features, but it was arguably a user
feature as well. The way it got written ? as an API that allowed for more
image manipulation editors to be added ? benefits developers, of course.

WP_Theme was an upgrade of an existing API. (I say that generously, because
what we had previously was terrible and hardly an API.) While it made some
things in 3.4 a bit easier to develop, it really was just something that
had been grating on my nerves for years because it hindered a number of
other things. It actually came out of the desire for theme headers to be
fully internationalized (a major 3.4 push) and after realizing all of the
potential performance gains.

Of course it was. My point is: I fail to see a problem with playing the
long game here. I do believe it remains plugin material. I also do believe
that it *could* become core material in the future. I just don't see why we
need to rush it. But also, just because it doesn't yet make sense for core,
it doesn't mean it isn't suitable for development or use.

I would be interested to know what types of open tickets are a critical
> path to object relationships?


Yes, there *are* a number of new APIs and schema changes that are a higher
priority, and that do need to happen before object relationships are
considered. (They relate primarily to the taxonomy schema and API.)

If the latter then the solution (for a need of this magnitude) is to bless

???. A process like this is already happening. Look no further than the
Posts 2 Posts plugin itself. A number of us like it, and we strongly
support what scribu and others have done in that space. I'm not even
questioning that P2P is ready for core. I don't think core is ready for P2P.

Often, when we decline to take action on something, plugins are developed
to fill the void. This is precisely what you just asked for ? over a period
of several releases, one or more developers are building and testing the
features. Even if they are not "blessed" in some cases, we do pay
attention. My point is, we're not "ignoring" it. We're deliberately letting
things play out at the plugin level. If you want something so bad, build
it. It doesn't need to be in core ? immediately, or ever ? to be a
successful contribution to the community.

What exactly needs to be done before P2P is to be considered?  I would love
to give any help if I can

Calling out a contributor by cherry-picking seven of his hundreds (probably
thousands) of comments is pretty lame. But given how much you've apparently
read Trac lately, I'm surprised you haven't realized that Marko's tone
isn't a matter of disrespect, but that English is not his first language.

Were they "snap" comments? Well, yeah ? he was posting his initial
reaction. Nothing wrong with that. But not only were his comments mostly
dead-on, not a single of them are paired with an immediate ticket closure.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Post by Email proposal (OPW / GSoC)
Message-ID: <CAF2uOE+K63uSj4Mz+x=c_HSz_N8HqLuuxuUF_0JB1nU+NPSkLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, folks!  I just subscribed to the list.

I'm applying to contribute to WordPress as part of GNOME's Outreach Program
for Women.  A bit about my skillset... I'm a freelance web developer and
have done many custom WP sites for clients, including plugins, themes, and
taxonomies, so I'm reasonably familiar with the codebase.  I also work with
JS/jQuery all the time.

I was excited to see WordPress on the list of OPW sponsors, since it's
something I use a lot and I really like the community.  :)  I've wanted to
contribute to an open source project for years, but have struggled to
figure out how to get started.  So I'd love it if we could find a good
place for me to help out.

Anyhow, I wanted to share my thoughts about the Post by Email plugin.  I
could get excited about quite a few of the things on the GSoC page, but
this one seems like it's been a bit neglected (at least insofar as
proposals on wp-hackers).  So I dug into it.

There's already a ticket in Trac (
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22942) with a patch to deprecate the
core Post By Email functionality.  This project would be to build a
standalone plugin that would serve as a drop-in replacement, and ultimately
improve the user experience.  An overview of the way the core functionality
currently works is outlined in the Codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_to_your_blog_using_email

This would involve the following tasks:

1. Convert wp-mail.php over to the Plugin API.
  - Plugin install: look for old settings and copy them over into the
plugin's options (get them out of the core database settings).
  - Create plugin settings page that shows an activity/error log.

2. Update refresh methods
  - Automatic refresh hooked to the 'shutdown' action, with configurable
refresh time -- NOTE this still requires a hit to the blog to run.  (Is
there a good alternative that isn't wp-cron?  Looks like that plugin is no
longer supported.)
  - Remove the old methods from the Codex (loading up wp-mail automatically
or in an iframe - this will probably still work)
  - Replace these with a manual "refresh" button on the plugin settings,
and maybe a template tag if we still want to support the iframe thing

3. Extend the current deprecation patch
  - Include instructions (or maybe auto-install?) for the new plugin (not
sure what the protocol is for this, I presume we want to handle it the same
way as Links).
  - wp-mail.php should just call the action hook.

4. Submit for community feedback and testing!  Squish bugs.

5. Extend functionality (Order and priority TBD by discussion with mentors)
  - HTML emails
  - support attachments (will be added to the media library for that post
and embedded)
  - support IMAP access (right now only POP) and SSL
  - add support for tags/categories/custom taxonomies (shortcodes?)
  - streamline publishing, maybe with an admin panel to vet unpublished
posts (not sure how this works in the current version, should review)
  - whitelist sender emails (this is what LiveJournal does) -- looks like
the current behavior does vet the sending address against authorized users,
so maybe there is nothing to do here, but we should review and see if it
needs improvement
  - PIN based authentication?  Might save us some grief about
security-through-obscurity email addresses.

6. Finally, edit/update the Codex page to reflect the new state of the art.
 (This should maybe be moved higher in the list.)

I've noticed that two plugins already implement many of these changes.
 Jetpack (http://jetpack.me/support/post-by-email/), which was discussed in
the Trac ticket, and Postie (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/postie/ ),
which was not.  Postie replaces all of wp-mail.php and is being actively
developed.  Does this change whether we want to build an official plugin?

I'd appreciate any feedback!

Cheers,

--Kat

Certainly they won't. ;-)

If your need is to do enterprisey/governmenty stuff like:

  * Change management: detect modifications made to plugins/themes (and
    auto-patch new versions)
  * Backups: keep historical copies of any plugins/themes that are updated
  * Restore: be able to roll back to historical versions
  * Logging: keep a log of backup/restore/etc. operations performed
  * Mass-management: be able to see at a glance what's installed + what
    needs updating, and operate on all your sites at once
  * Scriptable: be able to do all this stuff from the CLI, and script
    and automate it

Then, that's part of the need I had to scratch that led to WordShell 
(http://wordshell.net). It also does database search-and-replace and a 
ton of other things.

It's free in the GPL sense, but not the economic sense... I'm hoping to 
get a free-in-economic-sense version out at some point this year and 
will let this list know when I do. Some more big agencies buying the 
existing site licence would certainly help me have some more time to 
advance plans for that.

It's how Nacin said it. Some of the text can be rewritten to have a more nicer tone. But I'm always respectful to everyone in trac, even those who aren't that respectful in their comments.
The closed tickets are closed on valid reasons and I may hope you agree on that and some others are just raising concerns.

If you would have know me at all then you would have know that I help out first contributors a lot recently and helping with tickets that aren't core/current millstone focus.
Dutch developers who want to help out are reaching out to me and I help them to contribute back. One of them is a contributor now for 3.6 with his first contribution. Also I have a feeling that he will be really meaningful for the next release.

Also for the next release I already have a list of (old) tickets that I want to work on from people who have the same feeling have like Harry.
And a little thing to mention is that I do everything in my own time.

I'll preface the rest of my reply by saying I'm getting really weary of trying. I've been trying for well over 3 years to contribute but I probably need to take my own earlier advise regarding insanity and focus elsewhere.

Lame?  It was over half of his contributions in the past 4 months and most of the rest were his own tickets. I didn't cherry pick.

What everything really boils down to a noted lack of respect for people in the community that have needs that you and most others who have say on what happens in core don't run into in your day-to-day work with WordPress. Rather than be respectful about the needs people have they are dismissed and at times made fun of among the core team (remember a certain Twitter thread where you taunted that something was trivial, but never actually followed up when it was shown not to be trivial...?)  

"We" are always in the wrong, "you" are always in the right, or at least it's so rare to have needs acknowledged that it feels like always. It's quite possible that everything could operate exactly the same as it currently does in the WordPress ecosystem and have a lot fewer people frustrated if there were only a reasonable level of decorum and respect, but alas there is not.

For the first time in years I'm going to unsubscribe from wp-hackers and start the process of moving my business away from dependency on WordPress. I turned 50 yesterday. I'm just getting too old for this shit.

Your list is exactly the kind of stuff that could not be put into core in
any way that would satisfy everyone; and I include content staging and
moving sites in that.

Once you get into process/configuration control/automation or whatever
terms you might use then you go beyond this scope of this tool (WordPress).
It is not, and does not pretend to be, a complete end-to-end solution for
enterprise site management. Any system of that level of complexity either
imposes it's own structure and processes where there will never be enough
flexibility to satisfy everyone, or becomes a generic tool that requires a
whole lot of customisation and code built around it.

WordPress can be part of such a solution (and clearly is for many people),
but you will always need to build things around it. There are many API's
and hooks in WordPress to allow you to build such a system. It sounds like
your wordshell or similar tools like WP CLI  http://wp-cli.org/ could be
part of that solution.

I don't know you personally, Mike, but please don't do that. Your contribution to discussions here and elsewhere has always been valuable to me and others I know.

Why not write the plugin that creates the p2p table instead? I suspect you'll be surprised by the support you and the plugin would get.

Cheers,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Default jquery ui style
Message-ID: <5180F670.3030606@gmail.com>

Hello everybody,
while writing a plugin that I wanted to see included in the WordPress 
plugin repository I was looking for a default jquery ui style to use and 
found none.

Am I looking in the wrong place or is it true that there's no default 
style for the jquery ui shipped with WordPress?

Since WP ships with a lot of jquery ui plugins I think there should be 
some kind of default style so that plugin can have a uniform look on the 
admin pages without having to bundle custom styles.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Hey Danilo,

You are right that WordPress doesn't have a default UI style shipped with. See http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18909

to my knowledge only the .js libraries are available.

you will either have to use a cdn that has the css you want or download it
yourself and enqueue the stylesheet.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Project Idea Moving Wordpress
Message-ID: <CADmAPm3ynDvRS7E22RdqvzB5jgmLr86kkp3ji8Up6V7AXpMYrw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm applying to contribute to WordPress as a part of GSOC's Program. I am
doing my graduation form Delhi University in India. I am in the second year
and I am majoring from Information Technology. I have developed many
websites. Some of them are coded using PHP,HTML,Jquery and SQl, rest are
developed using wordpress

I am interested in the project on moving wordpress. As the current
procedure involves exporting the database, modifying it then importing it
back for changing the domain. This procedure is quiet complicated. Moreover
if the hosting is changed we need to modify wp-config.php. My idea can make
this task easy. Actually i have two ideas in my mind

First Approach
By appending these two lines in wp-config.php we can change the domain name
which is certainly not the best fix but works nicely. In my first approach
i  will work on the functionality of appending these two lines, improve
them and finally I will write make a code that will modify the file
wp-config.php by taking the required inputs from the user.
define('WP_HOME','http://example.com');
define('WP_SITEURL','http://example.com');

Second Approach
Second approach involves modifying the database (after copying it to a
file) by running a script which does the same thing as the one we do
manually after exporting the database.

I'd appreciate any feedback

Regards

This is where the WP community starts to become a tad difficult - especially for those of us who are not developers.I'm not a developer, so does that make my use cases any less relevant or accurate?We're running a WP install in a FTSE10 company.

At the end of the day, the idea needs to turn into code. Somebody needs 
to write it. It doesn't matter how big the interested company is if 
noone codes a patch (+ testing + maintenance + ...).

Of course your experience counts, but who do you expect to code the program?

Next best to coding ability is money. If the patch is profitable for the 
company, then maybe they should pay to outsource the programming. Then 
you would have code to post to Trac + you can contribute all the 
domain-specific knowledge you have from management POV to make sure it's 
implementing the right thing.

Message-ID: <CADmAPm1FH0Jyxi+EvouXWnUVVxFq8nEZKUn-qJVDUh8hb1xiUw@mail.gmail.com>

I am interested in the project on moving wordpress. As the current
procedure involves exporting the database, modifying it then importing
itback for changing the domain. This procedure is quiet complicated.
Moreoverif the hosting is changed we need to modify wp-config.php. My
idea can makethis task easy. Actually i have two ideas in my mind

First Approach
By appending these two lines in wp-config.php we can change the domain
namewhich is certainly not the best fix but works nicely. In my first
approachi  will work on the functionality of appending these two
lines, improvethem and finally I will write make a code that will
modify the filewp-config.php by taking the required inputs from the
user.
define('WP_HOME','http://example.com');
define('WP_SITEURL','http://example.com');

Second Approach
Second approach involves modifying the database (after copying it to
afile) by running a script which does the same thing as the one we
domanually after exporting the database.

I'd appreciate any feedback

Message-ID: <CANUcbHvkc3rBiY2QTH9mkycOvBw1c+cvwww5SVP8x+EJ0P6=9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

Sorry to spam the thread again, but I didn't hear any feedback on my idea
last time and I am very interested in doing GSoC this year. If anyone has
any ideas for me, or would like to talk to me about being a mentor I would
love to hear from you. Thanks!


Here is my second idea for a GSoC project. Again, this is basically a copy
of my blog post. If you would rather read it there, or read my other post
about my first idea you can check both of the posts out on coreyja.com. I
am thinking about taking the theme versions idea and doing that, but with
the twist of using git to do the actual versioning and let developers have
access to the power of git baked into WordPress.

Here are some of the things I am thinking about for this project.


   - Adding git functionality to each theme, so that a full history of the
   theme and changes can be viewed.
   - Ability to either push commits to your WordPress install and/or the
   ability to pull commits from GitHub (or any git repo) from the WordPress
   admin dashboard
   - Built in history page, with a difference viewer and the ability to
   revert back to any revision from this page.
   - Either creating a commit for every save made in the built in editor,
   or having the option to explicitly commit changes after changes have been
   made through the editor.


To expand on some of the details I had in mind for creating commits through
WordPress, I was thinking about have two or three different modes
selectable through the settings page. The first setting for be for the
?beginner? WordPress users, and would most likely be the default setting.
This would be for people who don?t know anything about git and just want to
have access to their revisions in the WordPress dashboard. For this setting
every save in the built in editor would be equal one commit. A second
option, for those familiar with git and wanting to use it would be able to
bundle multiple changes from the built in editor to a single commit. This
would require the user explicitly saying when they would like to make a
commit, and would allow for the ability to add a commit message. This mode
would also enable the push/pull functionalities. So a developer could push
any changes that were committed through WordPress to their central repo.
And also in reverse pull any changes made elsewhere from the central repo.
This would allow developers to integrate git into their workflow very
easily and while using current git best practices.


Also in any setting option it would be necessary to have some sort of cron
job, or something similar, to watch for file changes made directly to the
FTP and add commits for those as well. This could also be done with an
explicit option as well, but I think there should be some sort of system
for doing it automatically, for those users who just want versioning to
work without any added effort.


As before, shoot me an email, reply to this chain or leave a comment on my
blog if you have any comments or suggestions!  Thanks everyone for reading
and helping me out!

Message-ID: <CAFYyFtS5iOTf9fRnkK4rVeHUizCtdgkQi89zRZnNjnNEjRFnAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello awesome people of WordPress

My name is Hard Patel and I am applying for GSoC 2013 on idea Notifications.

This idea is derived from WordPress?s idea New User Walkthrough
<http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#New_User_Walkthrough>and basically
opts to do 3 things.

   1. Upon fresh installation, give user a nice friendly tutorial and walk
   them towards their first post . Keep track of how many things user have
   already done and how many are still left to do. Initial setup tasks include
   changing password, editing tagline, picking a theme, choosing a comment
   setting etc. At successive login, notifies users to go through remaining
   things.
   2. Give users tips and suggestions based on their recent changes about
   what they can do next to take full advantage of WordPress. For eg. if the
   default post category is ?uncategorized? and then the user creates a
   category , then the system reminds user to consider changing their default
   category to something else. Or if user has set to moderate comments, but a
   few days have passed and user hasn?t moderated any comment, then it reminds
   user to either moderate/re-evaluate how you filter/manage content.
   3. Extend its use by allowing plugin developers to put notices in
*notification
   center*. Whenever a plugin asks to put a notice on pages, the system
   instead put notice in notification center and *not* on every page. This
   will make WordPress dashboard cleaner.

I didn't want to bother you all by sending the "long" proposal entirely in
the mail.

Instead you can read the entire idea at
http://hardpatel.com/wp/gsoc-2013-notifications/

Also here is the link to my GSoC application -
https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/hardyy/1

Feedback from potential mentors are very much appreciated. George Stephanis
and Marko Heijnen were really helpful yesterday. I would also like to
listen from Eric Mann and other mentors.
Thank you for your time.

Best Regards,
Hard Patel

Hi hackers:

My project will offer readers a convenient and natural way to get what
they want, readers just need to send a message to WP on Kik or WeChat
or other mobile communication tools, and my WordPress tool will try to
response your message, giving the thing you want.

If you do not have patience, just jump to the "demo" section in my
WordPress and see how it will work.

See more detail with pictures, jump to my WordPress site, watch and

thanks for your watching!
Waiting to see your advice.

Message-ID: <CAHOkC05tvDCWzsxaZgr1skhOPE2qxAaYQYcx6sL-jHqRwEeDSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

My backend seems a bit screwed up. It was working fine a week and no core
files were modified.

Screenshot: http://jldesignloft.com/img/loading_error.jpg

As you can see from this photo I'm hovering over "Appearance" and no
submenu shows up. That is true for all other menu items with sub menus,
like pages, posts, and settings.

Also I noticed that the WordPress widgets on the dashboard don't ever load.

I thought JS was disabled at first but I visited another WP Backend that I
manage and it worked fine. WP is updated to latest version, and switching
the themes also did not resolve the issue. Any ideas on what could be
causing this?

Thanks in advance,
Jesus

Most likely it's a plugin causing some issues. 

If you open the Javascript console, do you have an errors?

I'd also suggest the WP Support Forums for help.

Hey Brad,

I thought maybe it was a core bug, next time I will take more caution
before posting here! After closer inspection I discovered the culprit in a
plugin file. All fixed now.

Thanks!

In terms of code, I totally hear what you're saying :)

But sometimes [people like me] point out things that are not code issues. Processes, testing, MVC, methodology, release schedules, communication, project management, training, digital security, best practices, CI, Vagrant, Sonar code coverage, etc etc.

I am often reminded of this reply to a comment by the truly wonderful Andrea_r:http://kevinjohngallagher.com/2012/01/listening-core-skill-learning/

WP is awesome, and obviously I love it.  It's growing, and changing, and while thats really really great - we need to be able to communicate some of those growing pains and the expectations of clients with real world examples without being met with "I can't hear you over your lack of patches in Trac".

I'm totally ok if my opinion on something doesn't resonate with the core team, or the community - [people like me are] not expecting [our] voice to be louder than others - but the idea that what we're saying has a diminished intrinsic value due to my lack of PHP skills is just daft.

Have a great weekend everyone.

Yeah stressing that aspect wasn't very clear to me from previous 
discussion. This whole thread to me seemed to be strongly tied to 
whatever stuff that also needs accompanying code changes.

For the cases of ecosystem change requests that requires no code 
patches, I probably am not WP Trac-seasoned enough yet to comment with 
anything meaningful. FWIW based on what I've seen wandering around for a 
few years, everyone in charge at least on surface seem to be quite 
reasonable people, at which point it mostly boils down to what @nacin 
said in his replies.

The problem is that patches get into core and there is no problem in it that you can only report the issue. Maybe someone else thinks it's a good idea and work on it.
And the severity and the usage depends on that. I still have a major issue that isn't solved yet since I spent my time differently and other people don't see the issue.

I hope that your list also includes things that don't matter like vagrant. WordPress is a CMS system and we help out in making that better. Things like best practices can be discussed on this list but sure not on trac.
A thing as training is a nice one and there is a site for that: http://make.wordpress.org/training. But as you can see there wasn't a lot of reactions. Partly because of bad timing. I'm hoping to get that on track soonish.

I can understand that you want to talk about all kinds of stuff related to WordPress and if the platform doesn't exists it doesn't mean it fallbacks to the forum for example.
That for me would be talking about multi server WordPress sites. There isn't a good platform for that and that is a pain sometimes.

So on core I listen to everyone and a lot of people do that. PHP skills doesn't matter that much since we all started at the beginning and people like me are at a certain level because of the help of others.
I can understand more why people have hard issues contributing back to UI for example. It's almost impossible to do and partly because it effects a lot of site's.

Thanks everybody,
as of now I'll have to include the styles in my plugin, linking from a 
cdn is not allowed if I want my plugin to be published on the WP plugin 
repository.

I'll be waiting for a default jQ ui theme shipped with WordPress


Thanks a lot again.

Hi Panks,

Rather than manually constructing the JSON ? which can easily result in
malformed JSON or worse ? what about creating PHP arrays and then using
http://php.net/json_encode()?

If doing it manually is a deliberate choice to keep whitespace and make it
readable, I imagine there are some options there as well.

Hi Ohad,

I am curious ? do you have a vision for anything "new" this should bring?
Would the dashboard change, would more functionality be added, etc.? Do you
like the current design and functionality of the dashboard right now?

I think this is interesting, but if it is just a light API like WP_Widget
plus a reorganization of wp-admin/includes/dashboard.php (less than 1300
lines of PHP), I am not sure if this is enough for a summer-long project.
(I could be very wrong with that assessment, of course.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2013 Proposal: Enhance Profiles.WordPress.org

Hi Mert,

A few thoughts:

 - To answer the "plugin, theme, or core" question ?
profiles.wordpress.orgis a WordPress theme. Lots of plugin
functionality too, and currently the
site uses BuddyPress to some extent. Just in case you needed to know how it
would be powered/written. There is very little good about the current
codebase and it would probably be best if it is a fresh start.

 - Along those lines, have you thought about how you would build some of
these features? How would you build an activity stream in WordPress (or
BuddyPress)? How might you scale that to allow for people to follow other
users and thus see their activity? I imagine if we showed the changelog for
a plugin commit, we'd show the comment text or a post excerpt for forums
and P2s?

 - I think you have a lot of ideas here, but it seems to me like you are
barely scratching the surface on all of them. If we accepted this project,
the first thing that you would probably do with your mentor is figure out
what is important and what could be a self-contained three-month project
for you to focus on. If you had to pick a narrow focus that you could
really crush out of the park, what would it be? What extra details would
you add to the application if you could?

Hi Hard,

I think this is pretty cool. We already have a "welcome panel" for new
installs, and UI "pointers" for new features, but there is definitely a
very wide opening for some work here.

One thing that would be great to hear more about is how you might plan to
store data (like the user's status as they work through the walkthrough),
whether you have begun to envision any APIs in either PHP or JS that would
be required to be built (and that plugins may need to use), etc. Basically
? feed us some technical details so we can see how your mind works!

Secondly: I am not sure how well a tutorial pairs with a notification
center. I think both are pretty important, but I would find notifications
to tie closer to activity streams than I would a user walkthrough. How do
you see them tying together? If you could focus on one piece of the project
and really make it awesome, what would you choose?

Hi Corey,

First: PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION. It is due today (and not at the end
of the day, either - UTC 1900). Thanks. :-)

Second:

This application really makes me think.

First, let's discuss use case. Consider someone who is storing their work
in git, and cloning (or directly working on top of) that repo in
wp-content/themes. Is this the kind of person that will use the theme
editor? Is there actually a benefit to constructing a UI for this user? Is
this a developer-oriented tool?

I see the editors mainly as a tool to help people who are messing around
with their sites. They aren't coders. (If they are, they probably should be
using version control, and I don't think we should reinvent the wheel by
trying to build a GitHub for Mac/Windows/WordPress equivalent -- they'll
probably do just fine with existing tools.) But they can play with the
syntax and modify their site, and maybe look up Template Tags on the Codex.
We can make it easier for them to tweak (and not break) the code for their
site.

I guess what am saying is I would consider is focusing squarely on
a beginner mode. (I attempted theme revisions a long while ago, and it was
a lot to bite off and chew at once.) It *is* possible that git could be
used under the hood for storage, but a custom post type is probably
sufficient -- and also, an awful lot of shared hosting servers simply
won't/don't have version control clients installed. I will say: If you
submit this application as-is, that's quite okay ? if it is accepted, we
*can* work out scope and details later.

Yeah, even I was thinking about the same, I'm seeing what's the best
alternative, I will change the design soon.

Also ? automated testing would be really important for something like this.
Have you had a chance to look at our existing test suite?

Yeah, I installed and tried it once, but haven't written any test case for

Subject: [wp-hackers] Transients that are not re-used after their expiry are
	never garbage-collected
Message-ID: <518380CC.2070403@wordshell.net>

Hi,

Just a heads-up for others who may not be aware of this - I was not 
until today, until I began to look at my options table with ~250,000 
entries in it (after 2 months!)...

WordPress does not garbage-collect transients unless you attempt to 
access them. This means that if you use transients with unique keys, or 
keys that are not expected to be used after a certain time (e.g. as 
access tokens), then they may never be purged.

Here's a simple plugin to provide temporary relief until this is fixed 
in core:
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/artiss-transient-cleaner.1.1.zip

Trac ticket for the issue:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20316#comment:16

Best wishes,
David

Hello Everyone,

Wordpress is currently officially available only for MySQL database. There
is a strong demand for porting it to alternative databases especially using
PHP PDO class. There is an article on the topic at  :
http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Alternative_Databases . I am preparing a
proposal to it as the deadline is quite near.
I like to know if this is a good enough project for GSOC 2013.
I would really apppreciate if you could provide some feedback.

Hi all,

apologies for the last minute post but I came across GsoC 2013 kind of late
and I thought I try anyway.

You can find my idea summarized here:
http://www.krap.gr/2013/05/03/wp-google-summer-of-code-2013-wp-code-metrics-service/

Since I am running out of time I will be sending the proposal in a couple
of hours, but I will try to take under consideration as many of your
advices as possible.

I will be probably impementing the idea anyways do feel free to send
feedback even after the deadline of GsoC 2013 proposals is over.

Thanks in advance and best of luck to all of the partipants.

Hey,

It could be a really cool idea to play with. I do see patches on http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663 but I'm unsure what the current state of that is.
Did you look at that?

Hi Andrew,

I would love to answer your questions.
I have updated my blog
post<http://hardpatel.com/wp/gsoc-2013-notifications/>and my GSoC
application<https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/hardyy/1>accordingly
to answer your questions.

A quick summary,
I plan to store data in wp_options table in serialized format as it is not
going to be too large to handle.

I have started envisioning Notifications API and more details about API has
already been updated at both the places.

By tutorial, i didn't mean simple text based tutorial. I meant current
activity based tutorial.
For eg if user has not done any initial task out of 7, then notification
center will display ?Welcome to WordPress, here are 7 basic things which
can make your WP rock?.
And clicking on that notification will take them to page which can help
user to complete remaining tasks.

User walkthrough is going to be just a part of Notification Center. Since
it is going to use the same API and mechanisms.

If you still think it won't be a good idea to do both of them, and i have
to choose between notification center and user walkthrough to make only one
thing awesome, I would like Notification Center based on current activities
more. :)

Thank you for the time and consideration.

Why would you have a transient with a unique key? Or a key that
changes? This sort of defeats the point of using a transient in the
first place.

Sounds to me like you should fix the code that is using transients incorrectly.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2013 - Settings API project
Message-ID: <5183FBE7.9090307@gmail.com>

Hey everyone!

I've finished putting together my GSoC application today, and thought I 
would share it on the list too. It sure seems there's a lot of activity 
here with the deadline so near, but it makes sense anyway to drop by and 
post it.

In short, I'm planning to review the Settings API in its current form, 
taking the necessary steps to make it easier to use, optimize it and, 
most of all, make it flexible enough to be adopted across the whole 
framework. I'm aware this is a big challenge, and I'll surely need a 
mentor to guide me through it, but I like the project and I'm confident 
it addresses an aspect of WordPress that benefits every user.

The Google application is here: 
https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/nicobadano/1
And the link to it on my blog is right here: 
http://www.miracledevs.com/gsoc-2013-wordpress-project/

Looking forward to hearing what you guys have to say about it!

when i use get_user_meta, my negative number comes back stripped of the - symbol.

Can anyone confirm this or have a suggestion?

Hi Chris,
Are you storing latitude and longitude as a separate individual user meta
key / value pairs or as a serialized array?

I usually use json_encode on a php array to store multiple values in user
or post meta and did not have issues with negative values in this case.
Regardless, negative sign shouldn't be stripped out. Perhaps, it happens in
the the processing code rather than in the core?

Regards,
Alex

I agree with Alex. The column for meta_value in the wp_usermeta table is
LONGTEXT, so you should be able to store it fine. Take another look through
your PHP code.

You might want to check you're not passing it through absint()
somewhere and casting it to an absolute integer.

Two examples of where I've used transients that are liable to not get 
garbage collected are:

1) URLs that are only intended to be available for a limited time 
period, and then to expire. A user is invited to visit the URL (e.g. to 
change their credentials, or take a quiz). The transient stores 
information about the invitation. When the invitation expires (via the 
transient expiring), that information perishes with it. But, if the user 
never actually visits the URL, then WP's lack of garbage collection will 
leave this data present forever.

2) Recording whether a particular file (identified via a hash of its 
filename) has had a particular operation performed on it (e.g. upload to 
backup - this may not complete all in one go, so information about the 
upload can be stored for a later attempt via a transient).

The Codex page just describes transients as "a simple and standardized 
way of storing cached data in the database temporarily". I don't see any 
indication in there that the above two use cases are incorrect, or don't 
fit that description somehow.

It's also probably worth pointing out that the code powering
profiles.wordpress.org is not actually public right now. Hopefully it
is soon (supposedly this is planned), but since it isn't, the code you
would be working on doesn't meet the Summer of Code requirements, so I
don't see how this could potentially be an accepted project (at least
this year anyway).

To be fair, I agree with Nacin in that such a project would be
basically starting from scratch with a fresh start. The current code
powering it is a bit of a mess, to be frank.

But realistically, I think the scope he's proposing is far too large
for a three month project. Nothing wrong with thinking big, but that
whole thing is just a lot bigger job than it seems like, really.
Better to narrow the focus, find one or two pieces and try to do that
really well, with emphasis on scaling it right and how to bring the
data together from all the various sources for it. Whatever comes out
might or might not be used later on, but that isn't really the point
of GSOC, I think.

Some good ideas I see in the proposal:
- Using plugin banners on profile pages. I have thought of this one,
but decided against it because it's reusing something designed for a
different purpose. I'd probably allow authors to define a different
image specifically for that page, at a different size/ratio.
- Showing latest blog posts from a personal blog: Never thought of
that one, but I see scaling as a real problem there, along with spam
being an issue if we're pulling other people's content onto the site.
- Allowing people to showcase/reorder their plugins: I'd prefer not to
allow this level of customization, but to instead auto order them by
popularity or something. Might be better in the long run.
- Gamification via badges: This is planned, but long term. A number of
other things have to come together first. The problem is that we don't
want to have to manage the badges, but to have them automatically
displayed for all sorts of things... and not necessarily just for code
contributions only.

Things I think are not the best ideas:
- Individual social media links: Which ones do we include? I hate
forms with dozens of social media options and then the ones I use are
not listed, or the ones listed I've never heard of. This is a terrible
user experience. I'm not saying a free-form field is any better, but
at least it gives you a bit more control. There's improvements here,
certainly, but a big screen full of text inputs fields for URLs is
crappy. IMO.
- Following people: Following via what? RSS? Email? Instant Messaging?
And if we're displaying lots of information in this way, then scaling
this becomes a bit of a problem too. This needs to be well-designed
and thought out before implementation.
- Profiles Homepage: Good idea, but needs the badges idea first to be useful.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Porting form MySQL to PDO
Message-ID: <CANyuBp0BvPTMMBvBBUjFHaXtmHqO86ZTx-J=nu2zam7ggdrKNA@mail.gmail.com>

I looked at the link. Most of the work done there for replacing the
depracated mysql_* extension to PDO. My objective in the project is going
to make use of the PDO class to enable support for multiple database
engines, so that the user can have the option of entering custom db engine
during the install. The project also aims at purifying the sql queries from
the database to be compatible to the db engine in use.

I have put this up as a proposal :
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/vibhavsinha/1
Please give your opinion on this project proposal.

The WP e-Commerce plugin includes what I think is a valid use case for
unique transient keys: [1].

The Australia Post API responses are cached using transients, and the cache
key(s) depend on the volume/dimensions/destination of each customer's cart
contents, which means there can be quite a few different transient cache
keys on each store.

As I mentioned, this would be a start-from-scratch situation. The student
would be developing a theme/plugin on public. We do know what the
requirements are.

I have updated my application, included link to few more bugs for which I
submitted patch today.
Please review it once again: http://panks.me/gsoc/

I would be modifying my implementation of export.php a little, in a day or
two, would update the proposal at my blog when that's done.

+1 on this, we see a lot of sites that migrate to us that have thousands
upon thousands of rows in the wp_options table, with the option_name
containing %transient%.. we've found this to be the case when someone
enables caching in wp-config.php but doesn't have an opcode or object cache
in place.

We're still investigating and trying to find something more common in terms
of how this happens, but it happens a lot.

Quick question, but just curious if folks ignore the uploads/blogs.dir
folders when pushing/pulling to/from local/test/production
environments?

Specifically, as a WP developer, what bits (specific to WP) do you
include in your .gitignore?

I'm thinking I want to add something like:

uploads/*
blogs.dir/*

Thanks!

Oh, nice! I did not think to poke around on Git for projects like
Skeleton! Thanks for kicking me in the right direction. :)

I like everything I've read on Skeleton README. Seems like I could
adapt the symlink idea to work with blogs.dir too.

I also like his setup for local.config.

I'm going to have to change-up my setup to match. I wish I had asked sooner. :D

Thanks Nacin!

Most curious. Any help appreciated.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Reinvoke wordpress
Message-ID: <7F1BBF58-ECDA-4FBB-9A18-8D4CF006C41D@ramapo.edu>

Hey guys,

I know this might be a weird question but I've got a weird client:

I have a multi-site installation. When a non-existing site slug is encountered, I reach the 404.php page and just before saying "nope, doesn't exist", I do some checks. If they work out, I would like to display some content from another site the same way it would have been displayed by wordpress if requested properly, going through all the templates and post_types and all of that fun stuff. So far, I have managed to detect if everything checks out and use switch_to_blog() to switch to the appropriate blog. Is it possible to reach my end goal with this? In essence, when I reach the 404 and I check and everything is in order, I want to reinvoke WordPress, just with a different request on a different site. Redirecting doesn't work since there is a mix of static files and wordpress sites and redirecting would link to the static files (precisely the reason I'm doing this). So? ideas?

Coincidentally, I just did something like this. Sorry, I can't share
the code, but the gist of it is I have two sites, A and B. If I land
on a page at B that doesn't exist (I check this during parse_request),
I pull the content from A (assuming it exists there). I then use the
WP Router library (https://github.com/jbrinley/wp-router) to hijack
the query and insert that content:

$wp->query_vars = array(
  WP_Router_Page::QUERY_VAR => $wp->request,
);
new WP_Router_Page($content, $title,
get_template_directory().'/my-template.php');

Have a nice day,
Jonathan

Whoa! Cool! I did not realize that they generated .gitignores specific
to a particular project type. Whenever I create new repos, I always
skip that option and add my own.

I typically use the one found on this page as a boilerplate:

https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files

Anyway, thanks for tip! Learn something new every day. :)

Hi Mika,

My confusion arose because there is no user feedback to say that the topic is being held for moderation. Instead, the new topic seems to reside in some kind of limbo with any attempts to find out what's going on simply redirecting to the forums homepage. As UX goes, this is pretty obscure. Anyway, thanks, lesson learned.

Cheers,

Christian

If this isn't appropriate for this list, I apologize. I am just really
stuck and hoped someone here could help.

Why/how is this possible, and what can I do to resolve it? As of last
night, there were zero comments. This morning, there are 11 new comments.
In the Dashboard settings, comments have been completely disallowed for
several days.

-- For each and every post and page on this site, the checkbox (for the
individual post or page) is UNchecked. I do this by going to the Quick Edit
screen for that page or post - I don't know of any other way to access that
option.

-- In Settings > Discussion,  "Allow people to post comments on new posts"
is UNchecked.

The comments are all on Pages. I've looked at the Quick Edit screen for
several of them, and see with my own two eyes that "Comments allowed" is
(and has been, for at least several days) UNchecked. Yet a comment was left
there in the past few hours.

WordPress is up to date. A lot of plugins, but all up-to-date. The theme
was from a reputable source (I believe) when when we installed it, but it
hasn't been updated in a couple of years. Here's the site:
http://ncdwell.com

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Patty

are all these comments coming in on attachments/images? Since you can't
disable comments on attachment pages maybe edit the images theme file and
remove the comments form.

But I'm sure someone has a better idea.

There is actually a plugin that does this all for you:

This should really be on the support forums http://wordpress.org/support/

But, Patty, are you sure they are comments and not trackbacks/pingbacks?
They have to be turned off separately, and significantly, you cannot do
that for pages in quick edit!

Mccormicky: you can disable comments on attachments: Go to the attachment's
edit page under Media Library. Make sure the Discussion meta box is
displayed (check the box under Screen options), then you can turn on/off
comments and trackbacks.

Ah, ok, that makes sense.Thank you for responding anyway. I'll do that
going forward.

I don't think any of this batch are trackbacks or pingbacks, but I'm not
certain how to distinguish them.

Where can I turn them off for pages?

None of this batch are on attachments, but I'm going to disable them as you
describe.

These are all on Pages. They do not appear to be pingbacks or trackbacks,
but how do I make sure that those are disabled on Pages? On Posts?

Thank you, Dwain. It's looking like the problem is the theme. Some useful
information on that plugin's page:

"Unfortunately some themes do not properly check the comment status of
posts..."

"Nothing happens after I disable comments on all posts - comment forms
still appear when I view my posts. This is because your theme is not
checking the comment status of posts in the correct way..."

It says that I can set the plugin to make a change to the database that
will override this (but that it can't simply be switched back later).

It sounds like I should make a backup and use that plugin in "persistent
mode".

On the comments page (in your dashboard) you can filter by comment type.
There is a drop down: select pings and click Filter. That will show you
just the comments that are pingbacks or trackbacks.

You have to edit the page using the full editor. Make sure the discussions
meta box is showing (the "discussion" checkbox is checked in Screen
Options, Then scroll down to the Discussion meta box and make sure
pingbacks/trackbacks is unchecked.

Whether a comment form appears or not is related to the theme, but if
comments are disabled on a post, even though the theme may show the comment
form, WordPress should not accept the comment submission.

In fact, the comment spamming scripts, don't even go through your theme's
form, they submit directly to WordPress' comment handler.

You should be able to tell whether your theme is doing the right thing. If
you look at a page/post with comments disabled, does your theme show a
comment form? If not, there is nothing wrong with your theme.

Ah, ok. The comment form does *not* appear.

And that makes sense with what I'm finding after pursuing what you
explained in your post just previous to this one: pingbacks and trackbacks
*were* enabled on a number of posts/pages.

It now looks like THAT was the problem, and not the theme. I'm going
through every post/page individually, unchecking "Allow pingbacks".

I also filtered the list of comments as you suggested, and most of them
were indeed pingbacks.

Thank you VERY much. It sounds like this was the problem.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Taxonomy and "Filter by Term" URL parameters
Message-ID: <CAHBjUcR2hyqv4eubYROVqjX3DsHxmVq=GF0ukJm5RfJuE_0pPw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I just started working on an issue that I encounter each time I use Custom
Taxonomies.

If you use Custom Taxonomies, it would be great if you could perform that
quick test, and tell me if you can replicate the bug, or if I'm
hallucinating...

Here are the steps:

In the admin interface, if we go into Posts > Categories, or Posts > Tags,
we see a table showing all our Categories/Tags. The right column of that
table shows the number of Posts for each Category/Tag. That number is
hyperlinked - when we follow it, we see a listing of all the Posts that
have that Category/Tag.

For Categories, the link is built like this:
wp-admin/edit.php?category_name=my_category_term

For Tags, it looks like this:
wp-admin/edit.php?tag=my_tag_term

Now, let's say you have a Custom Taxonomy, called "foo". Go to the page
that shows the overview of that taxonomy, which should be
/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=foo

Now, the critical part:
Let's say you have a taxonomy term named "bar". Let's imagine that the term
has been applied to 3 Posts. If you click that number/link, you will arrive
at /edit.php?foo=bar

Expected result:
You would expect to see a filtered list, showing only the Posts that have
the "bar" term assigned (in our example, 3 Posts).

Actual result (at least in my case):
The ?foo=bar parameter has no visible effect: it doesn't isolate the 3
Posts with the "bar" term. I see the complete list of Posts, without any
filtering - the same as visiting /edit.php

What works:
If I manually change the URL parameter to make it look like
this:wp-admin/edit.php?taxonomy=foo&term=bar then I get the expected
result: I see the list of 3 Posts.

I started investigating this and created a patch, but before I continue, I
want to make sure this *is* a bug, and not some wrong custom taxonomy
configuration on my side.

Trac user Knut Sparhell tells me that he cannot replicate the problem.

If you want to comment on Trac or add improved patches, it's here:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Why do some user meta entries use the table prefix in
	the meta key?
Message-ID: <518EAF52.6090506@wordshell.net>


I've developed some code that imports a WordPress database, and allows a 
change of $table_prefix whilst you do so. i.e. If the site you're 
importing had a different table prefix, then you can change it as you 
import.

The running of the SQL import itself works fine - that's just some 
regexes before executing the SQL.

However, testing it out has revealed something I did not know before - 
that various entries in the usermeta table have meta_key entries that 
depend upon the table prefix. Essential example: if your prefix is wp_, 
then your user will have an entry wp_capabilities, which contains your 
capabilities.

So, those also need renaming - otherwise you can't even log in (because 
the entries being looked for aren't there).

Whilst researching, I came across this plugin: 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/change-table-prefix/

It appears to know about this phenomena. It makes two adjustments:

i. (prefix)_user_roles in the options table
ii. Then all those beginning with (prefix) in the user meta table.

Questions:

1. Why does WordPress do this? On the face of it, it seems like a gross 
layering violation - table keys depend on the names of tables. But the 
WP core coders are smart guys, so there must be a reason.

2. Are there any others that anyone knows about? Any other hidden 
hazards to changing your table prefix?

Thank you!

David

Yeah it's not a good convention.

The reason it's like this is to support entries which can have
different values on different sites in a Multisite network. For
example, in Multisite a user can have different privileges on
different sites within the network. Each site has its own database
prefix (wp_1_, wp_2_... wp_n_) and the user meta key is based off of
this.

These are the others that I know of. There may be more though.

`wp_X_user-settings` and `wp_X_user-settings-time`, used to store your
user settings on a per-site basis
`wp_X_dashboard_quick_press_last_post_id`, used to store the ID of the
most recent QuickPress post
`wp_X_user_level`, only present for backwards compatibility with the
old user level system

As John indicates, users and their meta are "global". If you have a network
of WordPress sites, or are manually sharing user tables across multiple
installs, we need a way to know that the user's capabilities are for a
particular site.

To do this, we have a user options API. Unlike
get_/add_/delete_/update_user_meta() which are global for the user,
get_/delete_/update_user_option() act on the per-blog level.

The use of the prefix here is also why not using a prefix is prevented in
the installer.

 2. Are there any others that anyone knows about? Any other hidden hazards
> to changing your table prefix?


Hazards are two-fold:

 * Make sure you change all matching usermeta keys. Both core and plugins
add more than just the one you found.

 * There is an option in the options table that stores the user roles, that
is also prefixed. I believe its exact name is $wpdb->get_blog_prefix() .
'user_roles'. There is no reason why this option has a prefix; as far as I
know, it was done unintentionally back when roles were added in 2.0.

I have long thought about creating a script in wp-admin/maint/ that can
handle these "gotchas". It would be nice to fix the options table as well ?
there is a ticket, http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20152.

So, after getting some feedback on that ticket (thanks, knutsp and
lumpysimon!), I figured out that the issue is due to a script I have
been using in conjunction to the custom taxonomies:

http://yoast.com/custom-post-type-snippets/

The taxonomy_filter_post_type_request() function is triggering the
error. Too bad, it's really useful to display custom Taxonomies on the
post overview screen.

Actually, it would be pretty elegant if WordPress would display them
by default, or would make them available for selection in the Screen
Options panel.

I actually thought you might have been referring to the now-retired
wp-polyglots mailing list, rather than make.wordpress.org/polyglots. It
wasn't an unreasonable question.

I don't get this.... as long as all the sites within the network are 
still using the same database and table prefix, then the meta key prefix 
is still an invariant, isn't it? i.e. It only provides something useful 
if the different sites within the network are actually using a different 
table prefix. Otherwise, the same effect could be achieved by just using 
a fixed string instead of the $table_prefix setting. Or am I missing 
something?

Whatever the reason, it occurs to me that this implies a silent 
limitation on use of meta keys - that you must be careful to not use a 
meta key that could match a table prefix, because of errors if/when your 
site is migrated. Alternatively, it could be considered as a limitation 
on migrating - that you shouldn't change your table prefix.

Making this even uglier is the fact that underscore - used in almost 
100% of table prefixes - needs escaping in SQL LIKE statements. If you 
search for all the usermeta entries beginning with the table prefix, 
then naively issuing SQL like this:

SELECT meta_key from ${table_prefix}usermeta WHERE meta_key LIKE 
'${table_prefix}%'

will get you false positives. e.g. if your table prefix is wp_ then that 
SQL actually matches all keys beginning simply with just wp - which 
given that it's WordPress, could be quite a lot.

Very ugly.

I could have been clearer here. I understand the need for the blog ID 
1_, 2_ to vary. It's the reason for including the apparently invariant 
wp_ that I'm not clear on.

The database prefix with the blog ID appended acts as a UUID within
the given database. This allows you to share your users and usermeta
tables between WordPress installs in the same database, because each
has a different database prefix.

Example: I have two Multisite installs which share a users and
usermeta table. The resulting usermeta keys would be, for example,
"foo_{n}_" for one site and "bar_{n}_" for the other. If the database
prefix wasn't prepended there would be key collisions.

Thanks... what I didn't understand was, how/when does that sharing of 
the tables actually happen? For it to happen, one WordPress install 
would have to access tables that are not prefixed with its own 
$table_prefix, but prefixed with something else. I didn't know that 
WordPress had code to access a different set of tables than the one 
specified in $table_prefix. Or is it something that's not coded in 
WordPress, but someone could use some hooks to achieve if they wanted to?

Yeah it's a relatively little-known feature. You can manually specify
the name of the users and usermeta tables and WordPress will use those
instead. See: http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Custom_User_and_Usermeta_Tables

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can PHPdoc recognize custom filters?
Message-ID: <CABCyq-kM-=1YBWgAxxYsZWHZGJC97vKxALBro_20qjuHBPiJGg@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to get PHPDoc to recognize WP filters declarations? I think
that one thing like

/**
 * @filter_name my_filter
 * @filter_param string $my_param
 * @filter_args int 2
 *
**/
$filtered = apply_filters("my_filter", $arg1, $arg2); // this is the first
time my filter appears in code

would make sense.
I don't know if it is possible (I've always used PHPDoc for standard code)
and I'd like to know if
anyone has an alternative.

You can put something like that in your code if you want, but whatever tool
you're using to parse the PHPDoc won't do anything with it unless you add
support (i.e. with a NetBeans plugin or something like that).

One pattern I've seen in WP plugins is to set @uses add_action() as the
PHPDoc format for the line, then add details about the filter after.
Something like:

*@uses add_action() 'jer_after_thing_finishes' Runs after jer thing has
been loaded.*

or maybe:

*@uses add_action('jer_after_thing_finishes') Runs after jer thing has been
loaded.*

I'm not sure if the second one would be less 'valid' or not, but both have
the benefit of being very human readable as well as hopefully interacting
usefully with existing PHPDoc parsers.

Howdy,

I'd like to learn how to write a solid Must Use plugin.

Just curious if anyone knows of an existing, simple, Must Use plugin
that I could use to learn from?

I'd like to see an example of a MU plugin that uses PHP5+ OOP/Class.
The simpler the example the better ... I'm mostly wanting to figure
out the template/pattern that I need to use.

Thanks!

Writing a MU-plugin (AFAIK) is the same as a normal plugin.

If you're writing something that's larger than 1 file, (ie in a folder)
drop a file in /mu-plugins/loader.php and inside that and requice_once
/mu-plugins/my-plugin/plugin.php - this is how I've managed to get away
with it in the past

Subject: [wp-hackers] Quick rewrite question
Message-ID: <5192BDD1.7050200@wordshell.net>

Another question about migrating data from one WordPress install into 
another. (Thanks for the previous answers about changing table prefixes).

Other than WordPress itself, plugins, themes, uploads and other things 
in WP_CONTENT_DIR, wp-config.php, and the database, the other major 
place where site configuration can live is in the webserver's configuration.

For the vast majority (but not always) of cases, it's in a .htaccess 
file (or a web.config file on IIS).

Looking into this, it looks rather like, after importing the files + 
database, a simple call to flush_rewrite_rules(true) (found in 
wp-includes/rewrite.php) is both a) harmless in general and b) all that 
needs doing in many (most?) cases - it will write out a working file for 
you, if it judges it needed + possible.

Is that right? Anything else I should think of? I realise that .htaccess 
files can be infinitely and arbitrarily complex, and that there is no 
programmatic way of transferring one from one site to another. My aim is 
1) to do the best job possible for as many users as possible 2) to not 
do anything destructive to any users at all.

Many thanks,
David

Mickey,

Bear in mind that MU plugins are not checked for updates by WordPress, so
if you are writing one for general distribution and hosting it
onWordPress.org, users of your plugin won't be automatically informed of
updates.

You should consider an ordinary plugin that must be network enabled (set
"Network: true" in the header).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Regenerating re-writes upon migration
Message-ID: <51937BF7.7080909@wordshell.net>

Hi,

To answer my own question from yesterday...

If you're doing an online replacement (i.e. from within WordPress 
itself) of your own database from another webserver, and want to do a 
best-effort job of regenerating your (possibly non-existent) .htaccess 
file to take account of the possibly different permalink structure in 
the database being imported, then...

This is sufficient:
         global $wp_rewrite;
         $wp_rewrite->init();
         flush_rewrite_rules(true);

Only other thing is that you'll need to hook the the pre_option_ filter 
for the options permalink_structure, rewrite_rules and page_on_front 
options in order to make sure that WordPress gets the data from your 
newly-migrated database instead of from cached settings.

Much appreciated.

Honestly, the reason why I ask is because I've never written a WP
plugin before. I've got a decent PHP background, and have written
plugins for other CMS/blog platforms ... With that said, I'm curious
if anyone knows of a repo of WP plugin patterns, similar to:

<https://github.com/shichuan/javascript-patterns>

... I know I could just start downloading plugins from the net and
dissect; I guess I'm kinda curious if there's someone out there
collecting WP plugin templates/patterns (from simple to complex)?

Thanks to everyone for the time and help.

Cheers,
M

Thanks to everyone who replied. Thanks to your help, this is my first
WP plugin (shameless plug):

<https://github.com/mhulse/wp-deck>

It's a really stupid plugin, and could use a lot of improvements
(please be kind if you have feedback), but it's been a great learning
experience for me (I'm slowly getting my wrapped around the
ins/outs/idiosyncrasies of WP and its API).

I have to admit, I'm not used to using static methods all over the
place ... Doesn't feel completely optimal.

Once I have some more free time, I'm going to circle back around and
re-work the code to use some of the patterns/code mentioned here:

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/26186/should-all-plugins-be-encapsulated-in-a-class

... and here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8688738/wordpress-plugin-how-do-i-avoid-tight-coupling

... and the link Christian sent, which linked to:

http://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/bbpress.php

... which looks very nice in terms of the pattern used.

Anyway, thanks again ya'll! Much appreciated.

Cheers,
Micky

Subject: [wp-hackers] Two wordpress sites but one wordpress DB
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2GMA-raXbFYoOQZfmA2J19SjD5rWjL8NuxncZW487WBQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to explore the possibilities of a installing a new wordpress
installation which will be tapping into the same database as the first one.

The new site will obviously be identical in terms of content but I may
choose to install different plugins, use different themes on the second
one.

Of course, wp_options table will be my deal breaker here. but I'm sure
there are work arounds this matter.

So I searched the matter and found this post, but before I explore the
suggested route I wanted to check with you guys to see if this is the way
to go or not?

Thank you

Here is the suggestion.

<quote>

I've done this before, having 6 websites shoot out content from the same
database.

It's easy enough to do. Upload WP into both directories. Make sure they
have the identical wp-config.php file.

In the second sites directory do the following:
In the wp-settings.php file change the options database value to something
like this:

// Table names
$wpdb->posts = $table_prefix . 'posts';
$wpdb->users = $table_prefix . 'users';
$wpdb->categories = $table_prefix . 'categories';
$wpdb->post2cat = $table_prefix . 'post2cat';
$wpdb->comments = $table_prefix . 'comments';
$wpdb->links = $table_prefix . 'links';
$wpdb->linkcategories = $table_prefix . 'linkcategories';
$wpdb->options = 'YOURNEWPREFIX_options';
$wpdb->postmeta = $table_prefix . 'postmeta';
$wpdb->usermeta = $table_prefix . 'usermeta';

$wpdb->prefix = $table_prefix;

See how I've removed $table_prefix . in the options line?
Instead of YOURNEWPREFIX put something like 'site2' or whatever you want.

Then, in PHPmyAdmin duplicate the wp_options table, and rename one of the
them to be YOURNEWPREFIX_options, so if you chose 'site2', it would be
'site2_options'.

Bingo. Edit the information in the 'site2_options' table to refelct the
correct information for your second site and you will be on your way.

I do that sometimes for having diff?rents langages.

I just use wp-config.php to use a different prefix database according to
domail url.

I can send details if you're interested.

With some little more adjustements, I also share users table so the
WordPress installs use the same logins.

For performance[*], I would like to be able to reject any login attempt
where _POST['log'} begins with 'admin', and to do it at the earliest possible
moment, to minimize the load on my server.

Is login_form_login a reasonable place for this kind of check?  Or is there
an earlier hook that would cause less load on the server?

And what is the best way to "die" in this case - exit? die? redirect?


Thanks,

I've done similar stuff in wp-config.php before, a specific bot was hitting
my site rather heavily, so I added a if ( user_agent ) die(); check to the
top of wp-config.php..

I'd just add the same here:
if ( isset( $_POST['log'] ) && 'admin' == substr( $_POST['log'], 0, 5 ) )
die();
(Assuming the username field is 'log')

I'd recommend using something like Varnish or nginx to do this - so that 
the requests never even get to Apache.

Subject: [wp-hackers]  WordPress.org Stats API
Message-ID: <CAEbnL9_9SYtfUzoDJDhM74wJB3+tc_5-C+NqyL_fpESXvQ174A@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to get a filter on http://api.wordpress.org/stats/php/1.0/ (like
`?wp=3.5`) to reduce the result to a particular version of WordPress? If
not, can that be added please?
(I'm requesting the API handle this; It'd also be nice, but not necessary,
to add it to http://wordpress.org/about/stats/ )

I think it'd be useful for plugin authors to see the PHP version breakdown
for a particular version (mainly, the latest WP version) rather then having
older versions (3.0-3.4) mixed in.
(Just for fun, it'd also be interesting to see which PHP versions beta
testers are using to test!)

Example Case: I'm making a plugin that will require at least WP 3.6 (It'll
be in the plugin header, and have a check), and would like to use PHP 5.4
(or at least 5.3). Since the plugin won't run on lower versions, the PHP
versions reported for those lower WP versions aren't useful for my inquiry.

Currently http://wordpress.org/about/stats/ shows 62.5% on PHP 5.2. I would
assume a correlation of older WP to older PHP. Only 33% of WP up to date on
3.5. I'd further assume that the percent of PHP 5.2 for WP 3.5 would be
lower then 62.5%. I just don't have the access to that data yet to confirm.
Please liberate the data for the sake of us poor curious developers! :-)

P.S I originally sent this yesterday, but evidently was having
email/internet issues. I've seen on twitter that Nacin talked about this
yesterday (coincidence). He said that the data isn't yet broken down that
way even internally, but also that the difference in PHP version by WP
version is negligible. Still, it'd be nice to see the data anyway (removing
doubt would help). Also note, this isn't an argument to get WP to abandon
5.2, it's to get more info to plugin/theme devs.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Missing safety check in WP3.6
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk2TgspeUwzRFW+B=kDtTuMhCttapv05oZeGHGSPOzLCvA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have been testing WP3.6 and have run into a problem. It seems a
safety check has been removed since wp3.5. In
wp-includes/js/media-editor.js, the add function used to simply return
the wp.media object of the object, if it existed already:

WP3.5:
add: function( id, options ) {
			var workflow = this.get( id );

			if ( workflow )
				return workflow;

			workflow = workflows[ id ] = wp.media( _.defaults( options || {}, {
				frame:    'post',
				state:    'insert',
				title:    wp.media.view.l10n.addMedia,
				multiple: true
			} ) );

			workflow.on( 'insert', function( selection ) { ...

WP3.6:
add: function( id, options ) {
			var workflow = this.get( id );

			workflow = workflows[ id ] = wp.media( _.defaults( options || {}, {
				frame:    'post',
				state:    'insert',
				title:    wp.media.view.l10n.addMedia,
				multiple: true
			} ) );

			workflow.on( 'insert', function( selection ) { ...

You used to be able to create the editor's add-media window and make
modifications to it, using
var dialog = wp.media.editor.add('content');
dialog.on('open', dosomething...
dialog.on(event, dosomethingelse...

This would work in 3.5, since all code calling "add" would get the
same object, creating it if it did not yet exist.
In 3.6, the same method seems to cause double-creation of the object,
which makes plupload fail when user tries to upload a file.
When that happens, it causes exception where $index is undefined, in
this section of media-views.js:
info: function() {
			var queue = this.queue,
				index = 0, active;

			if ( ! queue.length )
				return;

			active = this.queue.find( function( attachment, i ) {
				index = i;
				return attachment.get('uploading');
			});

			this.$index.text( index + 1 );

Is this a bug in 3.6, or does code that interacts with the uploader
need to be rewritten, to check existence with get() before calling
add(), and wait for the initial add() call on admin pages, somehow? I
couldn't find any documentation on this issue.

Other than that, wp3.6 seems pretty stable, looking forward to release
day Monday.

Best regards,
Luke

Message-ID: <CAJaRH=D6jAqeTX=ziJK+pk+VE85hiGuAG66GaAT_RVJkHpiVyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have updated my Wordpress blog regarding GSoC (
http://gsoc13.wordpress.com/) . Update is regarding a plugin, which I have
added to the wordpress repository. My plugin is now public.

Its been quite some time since someone has commented on my proposal(on
melange). I have replied to the comments put, and have also regularly
updated my proposal on melange through my comments.

I hope that the developers community has been through my proposal on
melange and also though my blog. What should I be doing now?

Regards,
Pranjal Prabhash

Hello hackers

I wanted to ask a question about GSoC 2013.
Is it obvious for selected students to receive mail or IRC or comment on
their proposal(on melange) ?? Asking about more information related to
their ideas.
Is there any way i can know if my proposal has been viewed or not ? [1]

Thank you
Happy selecting. !!

Another good prevention measure is to set a simple htaccess password (or 
equivalent) only for wp-login.php. Yeah, the users will have to enter 
two passwords when logging in (heh, pseudo 2-step authorization?), but 
the bots only hit Apache not getting to PHP at all. Works on most shared 
hosting and reduces server load.

AuthType Basic
AuthName "[whatever]"
AuthUserFile "/path/to/.htpwd"
<Files "wp-login.php">
require valid-user
</Files>

Or you could just set it (as long as you are the only person who needs to
log in and you got a static IP address) so that only 1 IP address can get
to that file.

I use for my site an PHP based ip check and do block some IP addresses for wp-login.php and xmlrpc.php with Nginx rules
A lot of people always forget that XML-RPC is also a way to retrieve passwords. Do say not used a lot but I would personally use that one.

Why would you do an IP based check on PHP? Isn't that a waste of CPU?

It is but not a lot. Also I can do IP based checks depending on the user role. Meaning you can't do everything webserver side.

Hi,

I'm pretty sure they have seen it. I found out the hard way that every time
you post or edit your proposal, mentors are emailed of the changes.

Your project maybe clearly explained that they don't have anything to
comment on. There may be, at times, prioritisation of projects due to the
dearth of slots given but that's not in our control.

Either way, there is no point in worrying. IIRC, the result are on 27th
this month. I'd suggest you wait for the official confirmation.

PS: I haven't received any comments either.

Regards,
Suhas

Subject: [wp-hackers] hyphens to differentiate database names for WP in mysql
Message-ID: <CAMPo9sr_T1K6sKfYjHL037VA2RvJXcbQ+aqr+ZfAgAyys8R71Q@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I like to create my wordpress databases with hyphens such as wp-exetermusic
 and wp-mysite.  I have to escape them with backticks when creating them.

Is this a bad practice?
Might some plugins choke on this?
Are underscores or some other thing, better?

Thanks

But, there is that table_prefix variable to facilitate multiple wp installs in one db. Any plugin running queries is alreading prepending this to table names when running queries. According to the ol' codex, it says only numbers, letters and underscores - http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#table_prefix

As for the name of the actual db itself, I don't see why hyphens would be bad practice. I think it's just preference.

Any other thoughts?

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/identifiers.html

Certain objects within MySQL, including database, table, index,
column, alias, view, stored procedure, partition, and other object
names are known as identifiers. This section describes the permissible
syntax for identifiers in MySQL.
...
An identifier may be quoted or unquoted. If an identifier contains
special characters or is a reserved word, you must quote it whenever
you refer to it.
...
Identifiers are converted to Unicode internally. They may contain
these characters:

Permitted characters in unquoted identifiers:
ASCII: [0-9,a-z,A-Z$_] (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, dollar, underscore)
Extended: U+0080 .. U+FFFF

Permitted characters in quoted identifiers include the full Unicode
Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), except U+0000:
ASCII: U+0001 .. U+007F
Extended: U+0080 .. U+FFFF


Note that "hyphen" is not in the list of permitted characters for
unquoted identifiers. WordPress does not use quoted identifiers
everywhere (although it probably should, I suspect), so hyphens are
currently a no-no.

Use underscores instead. Safer.

Message-ID: <BD510242-4B1B-4A1B-9007-CFACB6389EF2@ramapo.edu>

Hey,

I might be missing something but I've been doing a lot of custom post_types recently and clean up seems to be a huge pain. Here's the deal:

I have a plugin that uses register_post_type in an init hook to do the initial setup of a post type (call it "custom").
Let's say for argument's sake I wanna focus on a page - http://mysite.com/custom/potato/.
I type that in before ever enabling the plugin and it's a 404.
I enable the plugin, play around with it, create a potato page.
Now http://mysite.com/custom/potato/ links to that page and all is good.
Now I disable the plugin.
I try http://mysite.com/custom/potato and now instead of a 404, I get the home page displayed while the url stays the same.
In fact, http://mysite.com/custom/[anything]/ will also result in the homepage being displayed without modifying the url.

Question: Is it just my setup and I should start disabling stuff or is that normal behavior? If it is, shouldn't we do something about it?

Thanks!
~Dobri

Hey Dobri,

You still need to refresh the rewrite rules on plugin activation/deactivation: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/flush_rewrite_rules

Hey Marko,

Yes, I know that, sorry I forgot to mention it. I have a activation hook for the plugin that runs init and flushes rules and a deactivation hook that runs just flush rules. Still, after deactivation, the issue I described is still there. I know that the code runs since I'm tracing to the error log when the activate/deactivate functions are called. I've also tried having another empty plugin with just flush_rewrite_rules in activate/deactivate and then once I've deactivated the original "custom" post type plugin, activate the other one so it's activate function flushes the rules. Even then, way after the original plugin has been deactivated and after three flush_rewrites, the same issue is observed. I'm testing it on twenty eleven now to convince myself it's not a theme-specific issue.

Thank you!

OK, so update:

On Twenty Twelve, at least when I enable the above-mentioned empty plugin, clean up is complete. However, it is still not sufficient to register a deactivation hook that runs flush_rewrite_rules. So, is there a more appropriate place to flush the rules to make sure everything is cleaned up?

P.S. this is how I register my function that contains the flush_rewrite
register_deactivation_hook( __FILE__, 'clean_up');

Sorry for all the noise on the list, if someone could take a look at the very bare-bones plugin I wrote and give me a second opinion, that would be great:

Activate the plugin below, go to localhost/custom or wherever your test site is and you should see a no results found page, which is fine, since there are no posts of that type.
Deactivate it and instead of a 404, you get your homepage. Add whatever you want without any slashes after custom/ and you still get that. Add something with a slash - 404.
Activate another plugin that flushes rules on activation or flush_rewrite_rules yourself somehow and voila - 404 on that localhost/custom.

That doesn't seem normal and I'm going crazy trying to debug it.

<?php
/**
 * @package Test
 * @version 0.1b

/*
	Plugin Name: Custom Content
	Plugin URI: http://www.ramapo.edu/

*/

function custom_activation()
{
	remove_action( 'init', 'custom_init');

	custom_init();

	flush_rewrite_rules();
}

function custom_deactivation()
{
	flush_rewrite_rules();
}

function custom_init()
{
	//set labels
	$typeLabels = array(
		'name' => 'Custom Content',

Hi wp-hackers,

What's the deal with post meta value escaping? I didn't see any mention of it in the documentation, but it seems important if you're ever going to store JSON data in the postmeta table (i.e., {"key":"value with \"quotes\" in the content."})

Reduced example:

$str1 = '\\"';
 
update_post_meta($post->ID, "test", $str1);
$str2 = get_post_meta($post->ID, "test", true);

echo "$str1<br>$str2";

/*
 
Result:
\"
"
 
*/

Thanks,
Dan

Basically, meaning that you shouldn't be storing JSON data directly,
but instead storing the PHP form of the data. So, json_decode it
before saving it as meta, then json_encode it if you need to send it
back to a browser or elsewhere.

Just to add to this, this is stupid. See

I'd agree this is a pretty good workaround. PHP can serialize what is
effectively superset of JSON.

"What? JSON you say? Who would ever think to use *that* for encoding metadata?"

I would argue this is insane behavior to create a workaround for, but in the meantime I think the docs should clearly explain what the deal is. As soon as I re-encode the hundreds of post metadata entries I've stored from Flickr/Instagram/Twitter I'll see about helping the next person avoid my fate.

Dan,

A simple way for you to help others "avoid [your] fate" would be to take a
few minutes and improve the docs yourself.

The Codex is a community effort and anyone with a WP.org username can edit
it.

As soon as I re-encode the hundreds of post metadata entries I've stored from Flickr/Instagram/Twitter I'll see about helping the next person avoid my fate.

I agree that it's not ideal (and indeed, stupid in a way), but I
wouldn't go so far as to call it insane.

The question is one of whether it makes sense to be storing
pre-encoded data or not. I agree that ideally, no matter what you pass
it, then you'd get exactly that same thing back. Due to one thing and
another, this turns out to be somewhat problematic.

But in the sense of "if it's going to have limitations", then the
current limitations are sensible and somewhat consistent ones. If you
pass it an array('whatever') in the raw PHP form, it will happily
store it and deal with it. But if you pre-encode it using some method,
then it's going to encode it again for storage, and then the
double-encoding there makes less sense.

JSON is an encoded form of data, same as PHP serialized data. Encoding
it again for storage and then decoding it twice when you pull it out
to use that data is somewhat silly. Better to decode the JSON into a
PHP variable and then tell it to store that, and thus the code only
needs to decode it once on pulling it out (which the get_meta does for
you). Then you have a raw PHP variable, and you can then only encode
to JSON again if that is actually needed. Usually, this is not needed
(you want the data, not necessarily a JSON form of it), and decoding
it only once (when you get the data from the external service) makes
more sense.

The thing is that it works fine as long as you're always storing the
basic form of the data that you're working with. Any encoded form of
that data, whether it be serialized or JSON or foo-encoded, might
cause an issue. Since you generally have to decode whatever it is to
manipulate it anyway, adding multiple layers of encode/decode is
unhelpful.

Absolutely, that's what I was talking about. I'll write it up. But first I need to fix my site.

And to be clear, the thing that's frustrating about all of this is that I'd moved on from a bit of code that seemingly worked, only to discover certain "unexpected" content was not being handled properly. If certain things can't be stored, it's important that developers know to avoid storing them.

Hello, list.

I am just to address part of this question - I think a quick test 
reveals what's going on to developer.

But I have a different question.
Otto suggests, that it is viable to increase the processing by an 
unknown order, just to address the behaviour of a function, that's meant 
to plainly store the data, instead of modifying it.
And Andrew suggests, that PHP serialize is as good as JSON encode, or 
probably better, because it can encode more complex data structures 
(that being PHP objects, to some extent).
I recognize, that this is related to the nature of WordPress - having 
it's consistent behaviour and all.

How do you feel about performance issue of this question?
I am not questioning the fundamental feature of WordPress (namely - 
backwards compatibility), just asking, whereas this could be considered, 
when talking about such functions?

To tackle the performance question, you have to examine the more
common behavior being used.

For the basic case, I'm storing information gained from some simple
process in the PHP. My data is generated or gathered from the user
input, and is plain text say. In that case, the storage of the meta is
simple, and has no issues.

For a more complex case, I'm storing information gained from some
complex PHP process. Say, an array, or an object. In this case, the
data is serialized on saving to the DB, and unserialized when
retrieving it. Again, no issues.

The only question of performance comes from when the data is gathered
from an external source. To pick an example, let's say I get data from
the Flickr API.

The data comes back from Flickr in a JSON format. Now, what am I doing
with that data? This is the key question that makes the answer
possible. There's two possibilities for usage of this Flickr JSON
structure:

1) I'm decoding it and using pieces of it to display something in the post.
2) I'm passing some or all of the data on to a Javascript process, or
making it otherwise available via an external API call.

For the first case, then I can either json_decode it when I receive
the data from Flickr, or every time I display the data in some manner.
Obviously, decoding takes time and though that time is small, it makes
more sense to decode it one time, get the data I actually need, and
save that in the meta storage. Saving the whole blob means I'm a)
saving data I may not use and b) having to decode it every time I need
it. Performance is better if I convert to PHP variables first and
discard the unnecessary pieces.

For the second case, then it would indeed make more sense to store the
raw data, if all that raw data is needed by the resulting final
process using it. API calls often tend to return more than we actually
need though, so in terms of space savings in the DB, it makes more
sense to decode the data and pare it down to what I need to use, then
pass that and only that data along later. We still have to json_encode
the data later, but it's probably substantially less data. This
tradeoff is difficult to measure in the general sense, and you'd need
to profile your exact case to know the faster approach.

Realistically, the first case is probably more common. The reason to
get data from an external service is to use that data, generally
speaking. It's rare that you pass that data on to some third system.
And even if you are passing it to a browser via JS, it's better to
pass small amounts of data instead of relaying large API responses.

Storing whole API responses from external calls, unaltered, rarely
makes sense from a performance viewpoint. Sometimes, yes. But not
often. Better to decode the moment you receive the data, then
manipulate it there, then store just the pieces you need. Smaller.
Faster.

Hello, Otto.

Thank your for taking time and writing this extensive response.

Actually I was thinking on the lines of "more complex case", that you 
described. Where complex data is generated by some PHP process. For 
example if I were to store some measurement values - I would choose an 
array, or an associative array. Structure simple, and complex, at the 
same time.

I might pass it directly to the storage function, and I would get what I 
expect: array stored, array retrieved.

But then, beneath this, there is a `serialize()`.
It is great, as it allows to implement callbacks, and allows to 
serialize data of any complexity, that PHP may handle.
On the other hand - due to this it's performance is not that good, when 
comparing with `json_encode()`, for example, when serializing rather 
simple structures (lists, hashes, etc.).

So, given that, I might use `json_encode()` and then pass the resulting 
data to meta storage function, where I expect it to be stored as-is (as 
a string, what it seems like).

That's just one use case, I came up with.
To me it appears as rather legitimate, for developer to try to build 
upon WordPress foundation, and try to use some sub-set of features, 
where possible, to achieve better performance, even in small parts.

Closing note - thank you for sharing your view, that was really insightful.

Thanks Otto, I appreciate your thoughtful responses here. This stuff is tricky, and I understand that WordPress doesn't attempt to cover each and every possible edge case.

I hadn't considered passing in non-string values directly, but that seems like an elegant solution on the face of it. But I'm running into a new problem that when I pass objects straight into update_post_meta() it seems that whenever the data structure includes Emoji characters it results in a postmeta string that comes out empty from get_post_meta(). Is there a known workaround for this?

I've found another solution -- go back to JSON, but double-up on my escaping. It seems to be working for me so far.
Like this: http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/60441

Thanks again,
Dan

Tests show that serialize is faster for most common data. json_encode
doesn't catch up until the data gets large. Too large to store as
meta, honestly.

See http://techblog.procurios.nl/k/618/news/view/34972/14863/Cache-a-large-array-JSON-serialize-or-var_export.html
for some numbers and graphs and so forth.

The json_encode function does have the advantage that it encodes UTF-8
characters into escape sequences and back, while serialize does not.
The serialize/unserialize functions also are non-forgiving of
malformed data, while json is quite forgiving. And depending on the
underlying MySQL version, character set, etc, it's possible that the
data being stored gets munged up by MySQL and thus doesn't get stored
properly (or undergoes a character set conversion), and so when you
get it back, the unserialize fails, and you get nothing.

This is indeed a problem. There is not a "good" workaround that I know
of. You could try using iconv() to convert the problem data to a
different character set before passing it to the meta functions.
Converting problem strings from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1 has worked for me
in the past.

From my Sequel Pro connection the wp_postmeta table info shows up as 'utf8' encoding. I've heard of this problem, and I recall there are several potential points of failure where the encoding might be corrupted in the MySQL pipeline. The fact that json_encode is handling UTF-8 properly is a pretty strong advantage for me, so I think double-escaping the JSON encoding wins the day, despite its hackiness.

Ah, but the conversion process would likely strip out the good stuff. The Emoji are to be preserved! ?

For what it's worth, here are the various incoming data I'm working with:

I'd say that it's definitely insane. SQL escaping should be moved down 
the stack as much as possible, and it should be opaque to the point that 
I'd have no idea that user meta is stored in an SQL database without 
looking at the code.

Escaping the data at such a high level is definitely insane. At the 
opposite end of the spectrum, you end up with magic quotes, and I think 
we all know why that's a horrible idea.

The "last updated" date for one of my plugins is three months out:

It should be 14th April when I uploaded v0.4, but it's showing the date

Did I do something wrong when I made that last commit?

Can it be corrected somehow?

	editor?
Message-ID: <CALri7Mkq5rhn=36sh2yXCYs1XGNDLVb2P2=YDyrXxZ_EdghJTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I hate to say it, but I've wasted half my day trying to get PHP to
parse in pages.

I've come close to successful eval of PHP code (only for super
admins), but the PHP opening tag gets converted to "< ?php" (notice
the rogue space) when saving the page in the admin (I'd love to know
what code is responsible for inserting that space!)

Long story short, I know it's not the best idea to allow PHP in pages,
but I'd really like to get similar functionality as the
ExpressionEngines template editor.

<http://ellislab.com/expressionengine>

For those not familiar with EE, they have a "template" editor that
allows you to essentially store your template code in the database. On
top of allowing PHP, you can also easily specify a URL to said
template.

In WP, is there any workflow that would get me close to the
functionality that the EE template editor offers?

The closest I've come in WP is to setup custom page templates. Pages
are cool because you can create custom URLs to your page, it's just
that I don't have the ability to put my template code/PHP within the
page itself.

Just curious if I'm overlooking something.

Thanks!
Micky

I've actually looked at that plugin. Seems like OK code. Have you used?

I guess I was just trying to avoid using plugin for this one.

Honestly though, I think I probably should forget about allowing raw
PHP tags in posts ... Probably safer that way.

The EE "create a template, one that allows for PHP and EE tags, and
give it a url" is a pretty nice feature ... Of course, a custom page
templates would get me 95% of the way to that type of functionality. I
was mostly wondering if there's a workflow/feature that I was
overlooking.

Sorry if this is a stupid/bad question for this list.

Have a good one!

Cheers,

I use this regularly: http://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-exec-php/
It lets the admin create custom shortcodes using PHP, so you get the
functionality of doing whatever you want to do with PHP but still don't
need authors to know php to use it.

Give  my plugin a try http://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes-ui/
it creates a UI for creating shortcode which can be defined to use PHP
and also creates a nice tinymce editor button for you to embed this
shortcode into your editor

Subject: [wp-hackers] Shared MultiSite Menus
Message-ID: <CAGtTZ+YjTBjuSrovCqg9-AkZCa0K0oFuL=hc70kLOL1uTWJr+w@mail.gmail.com>

I have a rather unique situation. I have a multisite installation with
approx 600 sites.

Of these 600 sites, #500, #501, #502, and #503 need to share menu's with
each other.

Currently the best solution I have found is to use switch_to_blog() to pull
in the necessary nav menus, on each site. This works just fine, although I
can't really predict the load this might put on the network, as I know that
switch_to_blog() is not really the most efficient function.

So if you're on site #501 I'd use switch_to_blog 3 times to get the menus
from #500, #502, and #503.

All 4 sites use the same exact theme.

Option 2
I have also considered saving the menus as Site options in site #500. So
each time a menu is saved in #503, it will also save the raw HTML as a site
option in #500.  This way, I only need to switch_to_blog() once, if I'm not
on site number #500.

Option 3
I have also considered saving the nav menus HTML as site options for all
sites, this way there will never be a switch_to_blog() function on site load

Of course, I will use transients to only run the switch_to_blog() once a
day.

Does anyone have any better ideas? I don't necessarily need code, but a
better plan of attack.

Is it possible to put a shortcode like [siteURL]/about-us in a custom menu
link?

I know it isn't out of the box, but it doesn't look as easy as enabling
shortcodes in widgets and I can't find any documentation.

This will do it:

function do_menu_shortcodes( $menu ){

If it's this specialized, how about on menu save from any of the four sites you create a raw HTML flat file and dump it on the server? Then on render, just pull that file in. Doesn't really scale obviously but it works for a very specific case like yours, right?

Instead of a flat file, use a site-option.

Hi Nick

I appreciate the help, yet it doesn't work. While it may return and do the
shortcode, the actual saving of the custom link strips the [  ] and you're
left with http://siteURL/about-us rather than http://[siteURL]/about-us

Dobri, thank you and I considered that as well

Otto, I considered that as well, but... It seems strange having a site menu
for 1 client, in a global network wide site option.  I can't think of a
reason why it would be bad, it just doesn't seem like a good practice.
Thoughts?

Jesse

I tested the code and it worked fine for me... [shortcode] showed up (using a custom menu item), then the shortcode output showed up when I wired it to a function.

Something outside core (theme or plugin) is filtering your menus and stripping out the [].

You could also do %SITEURL% or {SITEURL} (or whatever does not get stripped, even just SITEURL) and use str_replace instead of a shortcode solution.

Otto's right, I forgot you could do site-wide options. That's probably the best place. Awkward, I know, but there's no harm in doing it.

Here's another idea: if it's just a shared menu(not 4 separate ones that you  glue together) why not sync it up? Every time a menu is saved on one of the four sites, replicate the same menu on the other three. You'll only be doing this on menu save so it's not as heavy as doing it every page load.

Then use a transient in each site. Sure you're caching the same menu 3 times, but that keeps it encapsulated in that site and removes 99% of the performance issues (and the transient handles cache expiration).

can you add an action to the menu save, so that when you update the menu on
any of the 4 sites, you update the menu data for the others, too?

(so the switch_to_blog could happen in the admin, during save, and not on
the front-end during load)?

I think Otto's go it.

Dobri, thanks for confirming. It is 4 different menus that I'm piecing
together

Jerry, the issue with that is it will be dependent on the existence of 12
menus and that gets complicated.

Interesting! Thanks for the tips Mickey and Ohad. I'll give the
shortcode technique a whirl. Seems like a good workaround to the code
I was trying to write.

After giving this some more though, and having caught up on my sleep,
I think a combination of shortcodes and custom page templates will
work for my needs.

Thanks for everyone's help! I really appreciate it.

Happy coding all!

Cheers,
Micky

To be clear you're able to put the shortcode in the URL Field of a Custom
Link in the menus section of the admin?

My shortcodes are being stripped on save and I even tried it with a fresh
WordPress 3.5.1 install, with no plugins running 2012.

Oh bugger, I put it in the label field -- sorry! The URL must get sanitized on save which would remove [] as they are not valid characters for a domain.

So, SITEURL with str_replace appears to be the way to go as that should be legal and never occur in a real URL. You could use _SITEURL_ to be extra safe.

add_filter('wp_nav_menu', 'menu_shortcodes');
function menu_shortcodes( $menu ){
	return str_replace( '_SITEURL_', home_url(), do_shortcode( $menu ) );
}

This will allow you to have site agnostic URLs and shortcodes in labels. Tweak as needed.

I tested this one and it worked with WP 3.5.1 and a Genesis theme. Can't imagine it won?t work for you.

Oops, had an extra http:// in there due to the way URLs get sanitized.

Moving the code to a gist:
https://gist.github.com/nciske/5681384

Out of curiosity, why not just use a relative URL like /test/ vs inserting the site url in front?

Thanks for this Nicholas, that's what i needed.

The reason is I want to be able to do http://subdomain._siteURL_/about-us
so that i can link to subdomain sites that are prelive

I don?t know why your proposal was rejected or why you didn?t get any  
responses.

I like how you believe in your idea, and indeed ? the current GUID scheme  
needs some improvements.

You will face some very interesting challenges. Probably most important:

- backwards compatibility
- current misuse of GUIDs as public URLs in some plugins and even in core
- import and export of databases

I don?t have the time for a real mentoring, but if you need someone to  
talk about the project and your ideas or for code reviews, you can contact  
me off list.

Thomas
