Subject: [wp-hackers] Page Templates based on MIME type (like image.php)
Message-ID: <3283f0830807021101v6df98478u5eda3af5aa28557a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I was looking through the core WP code, trying to understand how I could use
the theme-loader to hook redirect all images to a template specified in my
plugin much like the new image.php file in Kubrick does. I found some great
functionality that I haven't seen in the documentation so I thought I would
share it with the list.

It appears image.php isn't the only special file you can place in your theme
folder. WordPress will actually pick up any PHP file that corresponds to the
first part of your attachment's MIME type:
Therefore: placing the following files in your theme will give you a special
template-page just for that type of attachment

*File                  |  MIME Type*
image.php        |  image/jpeg, image/gif, etc
audio.php         |  audio/mpeg, etc
video.php         |  video/mpeg, etc
application.php | application/pdf, application/msword, etc

You can get a full list of MIME types (and potential theme template names)
at http://www.w3schools.com/media/media_mimeref.asp
You can also look in the posts table under the post_mime_type column if you
can't figure out what type of MIME your attachment is being logged as.
Also, there appears to be a list of accepted MIME types in
wp-includes/functions.php on line 1214 and following. This may limit the
type of XXXX.php template files you can create (but I think you can add to
the list with uploaded_mimes filter anyway)

So, any of the above templates will fire off if you click through to an
attachment page with corresponding MIME type and filename.php. Otherwise,
attachments.php will catch all attachment pages.
Great stuff. If this is common knowledge or I related incorrect info please
ignore/correct as needed.

I knew that one and I thought it was documented somewhere, but looking
around, I guess not.

I've added it to the Template Hierarchy on the codex:

Sorry if I'm missing something here, but it doesn't seem like the 
term_link filter, which is applied on line 1976 of taxonomy.php is 
firing for me. I'm testing this against 2.5.1.

There isn't anything in Trac with regards to this, so I would appreciate 
if someone could confirm that this either is or is not working.

If it is, well, then I goofed somewhere. If not, I'll look into it further.

Thanks.

That might have something to do with this:

Seems Category and Tag links do not run through the filter

The tag_link and category_link filters work just fine, I was just 
getting ahead of myself.

Yeah, that would definitely do it. :)
Looks like they will in 2.6.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin Standard Suggestion for PHPdoc Inline
	Documentation
Message-ID: <486FEBEB.5070209@santosj.name>

I have a plugin standard suggestion for plugin developers, which include 
phpdoc inline documentation.

What do you (plugin developers) set the @package and @subpackage names to?

I usually do:

@package WordPress_Plugin
@subpackage PLUGIN_NAME

However, you could just do:

@package PLUGIN_NAME

which would work also. I just think that if someone took the code, they 
should know that the plugin belongs inside of WordPress, so 
"WordPress_Plugin" makes sense for the package name to me.

What do you think? Does there need to be a standard?

If not, then the package name should be reserved for core WordPress 
files and plugins must not use it as their @package name.

The Inline Documentation page probably needs to reflect any final 
suggestions made by this thread. At the very least, I'll add that 
plugins must not use for their @package name the word "WordPress" and 
must use something else.

Don't want to re-open the debate about whether APP should be disabled  
by default. But if the APP /is/ disabled per enable_xmlrpc, we should  
fix the warning/error message.

$allow passed to not_allowed() to generate Status 405 "Method Not  
Allowed" is expected to be an array, and joined into a comma- 
separated list of allowed values. If we're going to use not_allowed()  
to output this warning in the Allow: header, the content should be a  
single-element array rather than a string.

However, it may be better to use HTTP Status 403 instead, since  
Status 405 "MUST include an Allow header containing a list of valid  
methods for the requested resource", not an arbitrary user-oriented  
string. With Status 403, WordPress "SHOULD describe the reason for  
the refusal in the entity" body, not through the Accept: header.

I tend to agree, 403 looks like a more correct response.  I've asked  
Ryan to commit http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/7157/wp- 
app.php.4.diff

Shouldn't the @package be whatever the main wordpress source is in?  
The only reason these are pertinent is so that the generated source is  
organized in a meaningful way. This would put the wp core in its own  
area, outside of all plugins. Is that what you're intending? I would  
vote for your latter suggestion of the plugin name as the @package, so  
that they are all in their own area outside of the core, or in the  
same @package as WP, but the above suggestion is not ideal in my  
honest opinion.

The main source @package used for WordPress is @package WordPress. My 
recommendation already does what you suggest. Which means we have an 
agreement.

I think @package PLUGIN_NAME would be the best.

I also agree with @package for the plugin itself, and not just because  
that's what I've done in the codebase we're about to release. ;-)

It's not specified in the phpdoc.org docs, but their parser supports  
multiple @package instances.

So it could simply be:
@package WordPress_Plugin
@package PLUGIN_NAME

Which would also have the advantage to let developers add their own  
@package when the WP plugin is one interface to a larger OSS codebase  
(*raises hand*), and this without breaking whatever parser the good wp  
core dev folks use for automated parsing.

Actually... scratch this... phpdoc.org parser does not suport multiple  
@package...

"ERROR in PraizedWP.php on line 14: DocBlock has multiple @package  
tags, illegal. ignoring additional tag "@package PraizedTools""

Dam'it... I could swear it used to be okay...

And consensus says, "@package PLUGIN_NAME". I'll add it to the Inline 
Documentation Codex Page. Going to have to change my plugins, but that 
is okay, I have what? Three, not counting the one I haven't released yet 
because 2.5 fixed the problem and made that plugin obsolete and counting 
the one that isn't released yet.

Message-ID: <239036620807072224p7038fd44l1d091caebdf5f871@mail.gmail.com>

Hello to all!

I just finish alpha version of my plug-in called WP-Storage. Basically what
it does is store files in third parties service.

What is does now:

   - Upload file
   - Browsing
   - Insert objects into any post

Missing things

   - Delete
   - Another things.
   - Some documentation, I promise I will document everything in my blog
   tomorrow.

Any feedback we'll be welcome!

My thoughts as i look through it & try to use it:

*Please* use expanded php rather than PHP shortcodes (<?=), It'll be  
removed in future versions and many installs have it disabled allready.  
(It was only used 6 times, so :)) - a search/replace for `<?=` -> `<?php  
echo` worked well.

Just FYI, It'll possibly break with 2.6 with users who define their own  
Content directories, See http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6938 for info &  
workarounds for various stuff

Support for 2.6 would've been nice straight out of the box, using  
version_compare() is better than looking for 2.5 specifically in the  
version global

Seems I cant use Youtube, After a lot of buggering around, I dived into  
the code, Seems i dont have open SSL enabled, Would've been nice for that  
error to come through to the UI (wps_adv_get() -> $http -> error)

I notice you used addslashes() in a few places for inline JS, You might  
want to have a look into the function js_escape()  
(wp-includes\formatting.php  line ~1190)

Some styling for the Settings page would be nice too :)

The Javascript could've been streamlined a bit if you used jQuery & the WP  
Ajax or jQuery Ajax/json classes too

Good work so far though by the look of it

I noticed in the new Gears manifest that a lot of the paths to the
GIFs and such are hardcoded. Is there any particular reason that we're
not generating that code on the fly, much like it is the javascript
stuff? Seems like it wouldn't be difficult to do a quick recursive
search through a few directories and find all the images and such in
there, eh?

Ideas? Thoughts?

=> 'wpEditorInit', but I don't understand what that means.

The question is that I have other textreas in 2.5 that I'd like to be
turned into rich editors as well on the post-new screen (using the
Custom Write Panel plugin), but when I change the "mode" to
"textareas" then the main editor doesn't work correctly.

Is there a way to do this and preferably without editing the core?
I'll give a $25 gift certificate to Amazon to whoever figures this out
for me.*

Add a bit of script code to the page that basically does this:

tinyMCE.execCommand('mceAddControl', true, 'your_textarea_id');

When Gears is enabled, the gears-manifest.php is checked quite often for 
changes/updates. It's also set to no-cache headers, so it's always fresh 
from the server.

Since all images in WordPress don't change often at all, hard-coding the 
URLs saves some disk I/O on the server.

Generating the list of scripts and css files accesses only couple more 
of php files (script-loader, etc.) and is a lot cheaper.

All of TinyMCE's settings can be controlled with the filter 
tiny_mce_before_init. It passes through the editor's init object as a 
php array. It also sets compression and disk caching.

The 'mode' => 'none' stops TinyMCE from loading if the HTML editor is 
set as default. Later it's initialized with
tinyMCE.execCommand("mceAddControl", false, "textarea id");

When you're loading in on other textareas, you can replace this with any 
other loading method and change both values in the init array. Check the 
  documentation for all the options:
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Configuration

Also you can filter the list of plugins, buttons and any other TinyMCE 
setting for each page you're loading it on.

Another method would be to include directly 
wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce.js and start it with hard-coded init 
object. That should work well especially if you don't load many plugins 
in it.

Message-ID: <7425364A-A7C0-4543-A72E-819B602FE72F@freecharity.org.uk>

I'm not at all experienced with Javascript so I'm guessing that this  
will turn into less of a WordPress problem and more of a javascript  
problem. I'm looking to run a javascript function when the publish  
button on the post editor page is clicked. I came up with the  
following which doesn't appear to work.

function tc_print_js() {
     ?>
     <script type='text/javascript'>
         var el = document.getElementById("publish");
         el.onclick = showTC;
         function showTC() {
             //do stuff here...
             window.open("www.google.com");
         }

     </script>
     <?php
}

add_action('admin_print_scripts-post-new.php','tc_print_js');
add_action('admin_print_scripts-post.php','tc_print_js');

A little debugging seems to indicate that  
document.getElementById("publish") returns null but I've got idea why.  
Any suggestions?

Thanks,

James

Thanks guys, but I had to edit the core to get what I wanted.  I had
to change the "mode" in the tinyMCE config to mode: textareas and
comment out the other initialization used in editor.js on line 5.

It would be nice to not have to edit the core and do it through a
plugin but whatever.

The admin_print_scripts* action hooks get called in the header, so if
you run your script at that point no element of id "publish" yet
exists.  You need to let the entire document load first.  Fortunately,
WordPress makes this easy for you by defining the "addLoadEvent"
function on every admin page; just pass a function to it that you wish
to execute when the DOM is ready.

I've experienced issues like this with Solaris 10. Some unixes treat  
getcwd() and realpath() differently than how they should be (really a  
PHP problem).

What I did to fix it was chmod +x anything anything in the webroot path.

from php.net:

On some Unix variants, getcwd() will return FALSE if any one of the  
parent directories does not have the readable or search mode set, even  
if the current directory does. See chmod() for more information on  
modes and permissions.

Maybe that's the culprit.

jQuery is your friend.

    jQuery(document).ready(function() {

Evening Folks,

As some of you are aware, I've partaken in Googles summer of code again
this year, Writing up a plugin installer to allow you to install a plugin
directly from the Web Admin of WordPress.
Initially, It was hoped it could be put in 2.6, But as deadlines drew
close, It's been decided to push it back to 2.7 (2.6 Is out in a week, So
i hope i can get it in early in the trunk cycle).
So far, 90% of functionality *appears* to be working, Until its working
off a Live API Service (Its currently using a local database - which
search indexes of appear to be dodgy) I'll not know for sure how its
search results are like.

Working:
   * Search by Term/Tag/Author: Wording is still yet to be decided upon, I
like those 3 options, But some peopel find "Term" confusing.
   * View more info about a plugin
   * Installing plugins from the more info dialogue
   *

Not working:
   * Live API (currently running on localhost) - But the code is mostly
there, Just needs to be uploaded to api.wordpress.org, This is the main
reason i've not released much code yet, Its impossible to test the code
when theres no API for it to use available.

Needs work:
   * Styling
   * Wording & Grammer/Spelling(most likely)
   * Error conditions where the installation should abort, Or where the
plugin doesnt support the wordpress version


Theres a progress video available here:
http://dd32.id.au/2008/07/06/progress-video/ The Flash streaming video is
kinda shoddy quality ( Couldnt find any hosts that take high res data),
but the attached 3.7MB file is of good quality - Note that some styling
has changed since that video.

Progress can be followed via http://dd32.id.au/2008/?tag=gsoc

Cheers

It's looking good so far. But, how about a more "seamless" install? So
that when you hit "Install Plugin" is just shows a progress bar and a
little "Show Details" expandable link to show the details. It would
make it a little nicer (perhaps even less terrifying) for the average
end user.

Hm, Sounds like a great idea!
Except for the requirement for users to enter FTP details on some setups,  
which would make it a bit uglier..

Hm.. Maybe a Thickbox page inside Thickbox might work, With a simple  
progress bar like:

Eg:
(=============            )
Step 3/4 Extracting plugin
<a>View all messages</a>

The Atompub importer uses something similar, And it looks pretty good,  
Would really fit in with the plugin stuff too.

Message-ID: <4874A40E.6070604@gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm participant in Google Summer of Code and I'm working on developing 
the new search system. I was asked to post here some info about my 
project before mid-term evaluation. Below is some description of my 
project so if you're not interested in reading it, you can skip this 
paragraph. So, my idea was to create framework integrated with wordpress 
which would manage searches. Firstly, it would enable adding new search 
engines (for example packaged as normal wordpress plugins). Thanks to 
this we could simply allow users to use Zend_Lucene search engine or one 
based on Google Search (now AJAX) API. Secondly, I wanted to create new 
search engine for wordpress which would allow searching in posts, pages 
and comments. I've based my design a bit on Lucene, however, I made it 
much easier and I used mysql to store index. I wanted to create plugins 
for google and zend_lucene as well. Some information you can find at: 
http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/blog/.

Testing blog is at: http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/gsoc/ (login: 
admin, password wpgsoc). Feel free not to destroy it and please do no 
harm to server. It contains more or less infos from some wikis or other 
blog. However, you may find some info useful to understand how 
everything should work.

So, what is implemented? Basically there is integrated with wordpress 
search framework. You can reach it using $wpsearch variable. Using this 
object you can register new search engine, unregister one, etc... It 
also gives administrators simple management page (Management/Search 
engines) to show what plugins are working and to give links to 
configuration (if possible). Framework handles also changing template 
for search results.

The new search engine is also working. It is searching in posts, pages, 
comments and even attachments. You can exclude words from query, use 
"terms like this", search in title (title: prefix), by author (author: 
prefix) or in specified date range (date_start: and date_end:). See this 
post for more details:  http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/gsoc/?p=22
This engine is based on idea of inverted index (used for example in 
lucene). It gives administrator page with options to clear and rebuild 
index and delete also some documents from index.

Known bugs:
  - date issue in admin panel
  - double entries for some attachments
  - no type: (post,page,comment,attachment) option in query

I've also moved old searching code to plugin. So if someone needs to use 
old search engine he will be able to do it.

You can download code here: 
http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/gsoc/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/wpgsoc.tgz 
I couldn't find where google wanted me to upload it (I found only place 
after project ends).
See this page for some notes:
http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/gsoc/?p=22

I would be very grateful for comments, ideas, testing, looking through a 
code or anything which might help me.

Best wishes,
Kodie

Even just a generic in-progress animated giff would probably make it

Hello folks!

I'm C?sar Rodas, and I am working in Google summer of Code for Wordpress in
a project called WP-Storage. Basically what it does is give the possibility
to upload files to third parties hosting. Right now it had support (drivers)
for YouTube (only videos), and Amazon S3 (any type of files).

Right now it had basically functionality, you can upload files to any driver
[*], browse, and embedded into your post. The delete and update [**] are
missing right now, but I'll add support as ASAP.

WP-Storage's next steps are:

   - Add some style for the user interface.
   - The Wp-storage's browse & include (if possible) embedded in Wodpress
   "add media". (WP > 2.5). And for lowest versions of WP, it would be as now.
   - Add some improvement suggested by
DD32.<http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-July/020880.html>
   - Write a mini doc on my block of "How write a WP-Storage driver"
   - Write more drivers.


You try an alpha version by downloading this file *
http://saddor.s3.amazonaws.com/590d31d1671a2d6324454f5b8e31a902/alpha-wp-storage.tar.bz2
*

Suggestions, comments, bug reports, or any help are very very welcome.

Best Regards


[*]  You can write your own drivers.
[**] "Update" has the lowest priority into my milestone

Message-ID: <ece9e44f0807091130v26787bbdi3f1049f69e2ab02@mail.gmail.com>

Evening everyone,

My summer of code project is a plugin named codeWord, it implements
CodePress into the WP theme code editor, but with a few additional
features and fixes.
 1. It now uses some simple jquery ajax code for saving, which avoids
having to reload the whole page.
 2. If you attempt to navigate away, but haven't saved your recent
changes it shows a prompt.
 3. It has an dropdown input that auto-completes WP functions.
 4. Plus a few little fixes here and there, notably I fixed the tab
key to insert a tab character.

I still have a fair bit of work left to do getting everything running
smoothly, but I'd appreciate any feedback on my work so far.

In my remaining time I hope to develop the function lookup, adding in
default parameters for each function and linking them through to the
relevant page on the codex.

If you'd like to take a look round the plugin, then checkout my code
from the WPSoC repository[1] and if you'd like to keep up to speed
with my progress then grab a feed from my blog[2].

Cheers Joel.

	Report
Message-ID: <eff2e86c0807091812u7d9bdf5bj33f6071e5d1cf9f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm Ronald Heft, and I have been working on an AtomPub-based importer for
TypePad/Movable Type during Google's Summer of Code. The importer aims to
alleviate some of the issues with the previous importer, and provide a
simpler import process, similar to the current Blogger importer.

We're now halfway through the Summer of Code, so I'm sending out this status
update. Over the past month I have implemented the following features in the
importer:

- Developed a method for parsing the TypePad AtomPub feed (MT's is currently
unavailable due to bug in their AtomPub feed).
- Worked around limitations of TypePad's AtomPub implementation, such as
missing draft status and trackbacks.
- Wrote the code to convert the information into WordPress data.
- Created a progress bar to help make the slow import process feel faster.

Over the remainder of the program, I have set the following goals:

- Improve performance wherever possible.
- Remove workarounds and implement trackbacks / draft status correctly
should TypePad add those to their Atom API.
- Continue to work with Six Apart in getting Movable Type's AtomPub feed
working. Should this become a reality, make any changes needed to get
Movable Type to import.
- Import media stored on TypePad's servers into WordPress' media browser,
all using AtomPub.
- Test the importer on as many TypePad blogs as possible, both large and
small.

Since the performance of the importer is quite slow at the moment due to
workarounds and slow TypePad servers, performance enhancements will be my
overall goal for the remainder of the program. I want to make sure the
import process is as quick and painless as possible.

For anyone interested, I have a video of the importer (albeit, slow),
available here: <http://www.viddler.com/explore/cavemonkey50/videos/45/>

You can follow the development on Google's Code servers: <
http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-soc-2008/source/browse/trunk/ronald>

Anyone is welcome to download the current SVN release of the importer and
test it out. I would greatly appreciate that, as I could always use more
feedback.

Due to 2.6's release date being moved up, you won't see the new importer in
trunk until trunk goes bleeding again, but the importer will definitely be
ready for 2.7.

Since the Atompub installer has taken the route of a progress bar:
http://www.viddler.com/explore/cavemonkey50/videos/45/
I think it'd be good to make all the slow-loading pages (ie. Imports,  
Upgrades, Installs, Anything else that takes a long time processing) to  
use the same style progress indicators, It would be benificial to users if  
its a consistant design throughout WordPress..

I'll have a look at the code that Ronald has used on the Atompub installer  
and see if it'll be useful as a generic progress bar, else i'll have a  
look around and see what else can be used :)

The progress bar I made should be pretty generic. I'm just clearing PHP's
output buffer each time I need to make an update (forcing the page to
display everything echo'd so far), and with one line of jQuery, I change the
width of the inner box of the progress bar.

Sounds pretty much what i was expecting to be honest.
I think a Stage 1...7 method would be best for the plugin  
installer/upgraders as its got a set number of steps it needs to  
transverse through, whereas importing, the number if items could be rather  
large and having small incremental updates works best.

A bit of animating on the width increases maybe for going between stages  
and i recon it'd be a pretty good setup..

Has the Zend_Lucene plugin been implemented, yet? I just did a project

Subject: [wp-hackers] Performance Testing Plugin Mid-Term Status 
Message-ID: <48759F86.4030109@santosj.name>

The Performance Testing Plugin is a web based cachegrind file viewer. It 
processes the cachegrind files and displays brief statistics on 
functions which should be looked at closer for performance related 
issues. The plugin is for both WordPress testers and plugin developers 
and testers. The goal is to give an indication on what areas of code are 
not performing fast enough, are being called a lot (might want to look 
at optimizing most used functions first before looking at functions 
which can't be fixed).

The plugin is completed as in it is functional and can be used. I 
decided to write my own code instead of using Webgrind library for the 
lexer and parser, seemed like a good idea. I worked a great deal on the 
lexer and parser for the cachegrind files, and while I can't get the 
speed faster enough for larger files, I think it is fine at the moment. 
It is very memory efficient at the moment which is good, since it should 
be able to handle almost any file, as long as it doesn't time out.

The rest of the details will have to be worked out over time as to what 
statistics are better to be displayed for the testers and developers. I 
do see myself using this plugin a lot in the coming months after the 
Google Summer of Code is complete, so I do see myself refining the 
plugin and improving it with better details that matter the most with 
better functionality.

There are parts of the code I do like, the point that half the code has 
inline documentation and is somewhat clean before you get into the 
cachegrind process code. There still needs to be more inline 
documentation and there also needs to be test cases for several parts of 
the code. Those two items will come later as they are lower of a 
priority at this point.

The plugin can be found at: http://www.santosj.name/performance.zip

After the major issues with the plugin are fixed, I'll begin work on 
converting the WordPress library to a PHP extension. My project consists 
of two parts, the Performance Testing Plugin and the WordPress PHP 
extension. The latter of which will commence next week, while I put the 
finishing touches on the plugin.

Hi,

no it hasn't been implemented yet and of course I am very interested 
with any help.

Thanks!

Thanks for pointing that out!  I had fixed that, but I think I accidentally
saved over the correct version at some point.  The next version fixes it.

Hi all, 

I'm creating my first plugin, and making some great progress. I'd like to share it as a 
"beta" with you for testing, suggestions and feedback. 

It's called WP Tuner: analyzes performance of WordPress, themes and plugins. Shows 
overall timing, and analyzes all DB queries triggered by both core and plugins. Shows 
what is slowing down your blog. Also shows server load if possible. 

Download here for now: www.ds.org/files/plugins/wptuner-0.4.zip 

I've already used this to fix some critical issues on a major blog (125k comments, zillions 
of hits). 

Some nice and/or unusual aspects of my design: 
* Mu-compatible, translatable, uninstallable 
* Self-installs, very carefully, into wp-config.php 
* Backward compatible to 2.0.6 (tested on 2.2.1, earlier via code inspection) 
* Injects itself into wpdb class on the fly (I was rather pleased with this! I 
 love php :) ) 
* Self-diagnoses most possible installation challenges 
* Simple presets plus custom configs 
* Developer-friendly aspects, including a nice logging capability 
* Invisible to normal site users 

Some questions I have: 
* Is this a waste of time? I don't want to publish a plugin that's already out there 100 
times. 
* My admin page is VERY ugly on older WP. I'm using the usual CSS as far as I know. Is 
it just not worth cleaning up? 
* Anything else I can/should do to make this more useful? 

The only thing NOT working AFAIK is the links to further info: me, the plugin, a donation 
tip jar. I've not yet built my own blog (but getting close). (Yes, I built this plugin before 
ever starting to blog. Mostly wanted to help a friend...) 

Your thoughts much appreciated! 
Pete

I'm not sure I've seen code that was object oriented and procedural with 
majority of usage with globals. Did you choose that because of the 
performance of using globals vs properties?

Using microtime() (or was it time(), but I hope it wasn't time()) is not 
the best method to tell the performance. It might tell you trouble spots 
of where to look, but it is using a broad brush when you should be using 
a finer one.

It is slightly funny, I made a similar plugin: 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/performance-testing/ with a similar 
goal. Great minds must think alike eh? Or at least need breeds 
invention, so on and so on.

There aren't hundreds, there are currently only two. Yours and mine 
(that I know of, there might be some private ones out there) and I look 
forward to what you come up with. Some of your code did give a few ideas.

One suggestion is to use the XDebug xdebug_time_index( ) to get the 
time. It might give a better indicator. What I do like about your plugin 
is that you don't require any extra PHP extensions that are non-standard 
on most PHP installations, like mine does. However, I do think that if 
someone is going to be profiling and debugging they should be using 
XDebug to do so.

Good luck,

Jacob Santos

Message-ID: <1215776534.7416.33.camel@rillian>

Has anyone else noticed Akismet going spastic lately?

In the past two weeks, it has let through about 10 spam comments
_per_day_.

This happened to me and a few others between 6 and 12 months ago, if I
remember correctly. Matt M. put me in a special watch queue to see what
was going on, but I don't know what came of that.

Gotta say that I'm not a fan of the way you're inserting the scripts...

Problem 1: A stylesheet link in the footer? Does not validate. Move it
to the header section.
Problem 2: Why are you not using wp_enqueue_script? Looks like you
made an abortive attempt at that? Try this sort of thing:

function codeWord_scripts() {
        wp_enqueue_script('jquery-form'); // already defined by wordpress
        wp_enqueue_script('jquery-bgiframe',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/jquery.bgiframe.min.js',
array('jquery'), '2.1.1' );
        wp_enqueue_script('jquery-autocomplete',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js',
array('jquery'), '1.0.2' );
        wp_enqueue_script('localdata',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/localdata',
array('jquery'), '1.0' );
        wp_enqueue_styles('jquery-autocomplete',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.css',
array(), '1.0.2' );
}
add_action('admin_menu', 'codeWord_scripts');


That will work for both the styles and the scripts. Note that the
enqueue style stuff is new to WordPress 2.6, I think.

Additional: Just tried it, this code works with 2.6 beta 3:

function codeWord_footer() {	
	global $codeWord_abs_dir;
	// the codeWord_url variable must be set incase WordPress is not
installed in the base url.
	printf('<script type="text/javascript">var codeWord_url =
\'%s\';</script>', get_bloginfo('wpurl'));
	// add main js file to determine the current filetype and browser and
serve the according codePress engine.
	printf('<script type="text/javascript"
src="%s/codeword.js"></script>', $codeWord_abs_dir);
}

function codeWord_scripts() {
       wp_enqueue_script('jquery-form'); // already defined by wordpress
       wp_enqueue_script('jquery-bgiframe',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/jquery.bgiframe.min.js',
array('jquery'), '2.1.1' );
       wp_enqueue_script('jquery-autocomplete',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js',
array('jquery'), '1.0.2' );
       wp_enqueue_script('localdata',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/localdata',
array('jquery'), '1.0' );
       wp_enqueue_style('jquery-autocomplete',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.css',
array(), '1.0.2' );
       wp_enqueue_style('codeword',
'/wp-content/plugins/codeword/codeword.css', array(), '1.0');
}

// check the url to see if the current page is the theme editor, if so
then chocks away..
if(strpos($_SERVER[ 'REQUEST_URI' ], 'theme-editor.php') !== false) {
	add_action('admin_footer', 'codeWord_footer');
	add_action('admin_menu', 'codeWord_scripts');
}


It's very neat, actually. I like the syntax highlighting and the
ability to use the Tab key correctly in the theme editor.

Other minor nitpicks:

That manual definition of the plugin directory/URL in codeword.php is
not needed. There's a constant of WP_PLUGIN_URL that holds the URL to
the plugins, so WP_PLUGIN_URL . 'codeword' would be good enough to
give you the URL you need.

The function search box has a few issues. When I tried to type "the_",
then it has trouble when I hit the shift key to type the underscore.

The Indent Guides button doesn't seem to do anything. Maybe I'm missing it?

Recently (read as: last few months), I've been getting about 10 or so spam
comments per a day that all have "[BLOCKED BY STBV]" as the first part of
the name. I keep marking them as spam, but they keeping getting put in my
moderation queue.

It's getting to the point where I'm about ready to code up a plugin to
automatically reject and submit as spam any comment that contains that
string.

Anybody else having a similar issue?

You must be using the Simple trackback validation plugin:
http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/plugins/simple-trackback-validation/
I think you can set it to delete those spam directly.

Yep. Settings->Simple TB Validation. Lots of options to do stuff with
things that fail its checks.

Just FYI: I have a blog setup for testing that I've neglected to activate
any comment spam on yet. I usually just ignore the email notifications... I
get a couple a day but its not that bad because the site isn't linked from
anywhere. Anyway, this week has seen a large increase in volume. I'd be
willing to bet a new punk / server / script debuted somewhere in the world
this week.

I'm assuming that this is only in trunk, am I correct? Not in 2.5.x as 
far as I know, and a grep of the source seems to confirm that.

That's correct, but you should start using it now. Planet Ozh has a 
great tutorial 
<http://planetozh.com/blog/2008/07/what-plugin-coders-must-know-about-wordpress-26/> 
on how to handle the switchover while keeping your code pre-2.6 compatible.

Partially performance, and partially just being lazy -- I wrote some of this code a VERY 
long time ago, before PHP had classes ;)... I will clean up the code a bit more at some 
point.

The timer globals are (or more accurately: once were) tuned carefully for performance 
and repeatability. There are some additional features I've not yet ported into this. I might 
never do it, because as you say, XDebug (and your plugin) provide much more 
comprehensive timing analysis for developers.

Mind if I make reference to your plugin, for developers looking for more timing detail?

>Using microtime()...not the best method to tell the

It seems to depend on the platform. I've had repeatability to a few microseconds, which 
is plenty good enough for almost anything... and repeatability to a few milliseconds, 
which is only good for major issues.

Note that I use microtime() for clock time, and get_rusage() for cpu. The hard part is that 
my primary focus is on MySQL... and there's no guarantee that MySQL is running in the 
same CPU let alone the same process space. So, I only look at clock time when 
examining SQL query performance.

>It is slightly funny, I made a similar plugin:

Ah! I just found that one a couple of days ago. Yes, necessity breeds invention. I'm sure 
you wrote yours because you needed it... and I suspect you are quite familiar with 
XDebug ;)

Different goals. Yours appears to do a great job of capturing (XDebug-based) code 
tracing. That's a level that mine would never accomplish without serious pain.

>Some of your code did give a few ideas.

Good! I'm always glad to share.

>One suggestion is to use the XDebug xdebug_time_index( ) to get the 
>time. It might give a better indicator.

I'm not sure if I want mine to require XDebug. Maybe as an option, if there, for dev's... 
hmmm....

> What I do like about your plugin is that you don't require any extra PHP
> extensions that are non-standard on most PHP installations, like mine does.

Yours is clearly 100% aimed at dev's -- as it should be.
Mine is 100% aimed at the average site admin. If dev's find it helpful, that's good too.

For me, avoiding complex install is crucial. That's why I went to so much trouble to make 
it fully self-configuring/self-patching. Any dev can easily plug a couple of lines of code 
into wp-config... but I imagine many admins would be nervous about that.

Thanks for the feedback and encouragement, Jacob!

Thanks for all the help Otto,

> Gotta say that I'm not a fan of the way you're inserting the scripts...
You're right I really should have been using wp_enqueue_script for the
other scripts that don't need to go in the document body and I'm not
sure why the stylesheet ended up there too, I'll update my code.

> That manual definition of the plugin directory/URL in codeword.php is

I hadn't heard of the WP_PLUGIN_URL constant yet, so I'll use that
too, thanks Gaarai for the link on backwards compatibility there.

> The function search box has a few issues. When I tried to type "the_",

Yeah I just changed over the autocomplete script I was using, this one
still needs some work integrating, but I've sorted out the shift key
issue.

Yep, that's a fairly common problem. A good first step is deactivating 
other plugins that might be interfering with Akismet for a day or two, 
just to check.

+1 to this. If nobody has coded anything up after a week or two (I'm
going to be AFK for a week), I'll take on the job.

Well, to do this, you need to be able to set third-party cookies. This
is, I believe, allowed by default in all major browsers, but who knows
-- a major XSS issue could be discovered in the practice, and one day
soon, third-party cookies may be blocked completely in all browsers by
default.

This can be done at login-time. I believe WordPress' (and WordPress
MU's) cookie-setting functions are defined in pluggable.php, so you can
override the function so that when you set the cookies, you also set the
same cookies for the user's custom domain.

Well WordPress.com does it, so it is obviously possible somehow.

wp.com sets a cookie on the wp.com domain, and all the references
inside the page, including the login bar and everything else, come
from s.wordpress.com.

Look closely at icanhascheezburger.com, for example.

Hi Everyone,

I seem to have reached an impasse with regards to delayed publishing in 
a plugin of mine.
Here's the background:

I have a new Write screen which uses all the existing Write post 
infrastructure (edit-form-advanced.php, post.php, etc.). All I do is 
make a few changes the default post object provided by 
get_default_post_to_edit() upon initialization. Specifically, I just set 
the post_type to a different string, and force comment_status to closed.

The posts publish fine. They even seem to schedule fine. However, when 
it comes time for them to publish, status on the Manage screen stays 
"Scheduled" and the time starts displaying time since it should have 
published, although it retains the "from now" suffix.

Regular posts schedule and publish just fine.

Now, I have dug around a bunch, but haven't seen anything that would 
prevent a post with a different post type to no be published by the 
scheduler.

Perhaps someone could point me in the right direction?

I'm running 2.5.1, and have no other plugins, other than the one I'm 
working on, enabled.

Thanks.
-Jason

On WordPress.com we have a script called remote-login.php that does
all of this. If you have a WordPress.com account, you can see it in
action by visiting any domain-mapped blog while logged in to
wordpress.com. Here's the rundown:

When you visit a domain mapped blog (example.com) we include a script like this:
http://wordpress.com/remote-login.php?action=js&...

If you are logged in, cookies are sent with that request to
wordpress.com. Seeing no cookies, the script is blank. If login
cookies are present, the script generates a login key, saves it, and
redirects you:
http://example.com/remote-login.php?login=12345abc67890def

That login key is looked up and if valid, you are given login cookies
for example.com, the key is deleted (one-time use) and you get
redirected to example.com. This time your request includes login
cookies.

The whole process usually takes only a second or two.

Cheers,
Andy

check_and_publish_future_post checks that the post a) exists and b)
has a post_status = 'future'. If so, then it publishes it (using
wp_publish_post). If either fails, then nothing happens, the post is
left unchanged.

Step A is done by simply calling get_post($post_id) on your post. Does
that work properly? Check that get_post() returns your post info.

Step B is done by simply looking at the post_status of the gotten
post. Make sure it is still set to "future" properly.

Ahhh yeah. I assumed I'd have to setup a cross-domain login table like that. 
Thanks for confirming and explaining. Shouldn't be difficult, but will you
guys ever release that code into WPMU-land?

for any future searchers, this is not correct. setting third-party cookies is
not standard, and would have major security implications. you could
sometimes cheat with remote images, but this has been increasingly closed up
as the browsers find new releases.

Ladies and Gents --

Spam Karma has been released under the GPL.

<http://unknowngenius.com/blog/archives/2008/07/14/spam-karma-is-gpl/>

I hope some capable programmers pick this up -- it is an incredibly  
capable anti-spam system.  I've used it for years (with Akismet  
running within it via SK plugin).  Perhaps the WordPress community  
should consider making it an official part of WordPress, or at least  
give it some closer ties.

I know there is some sort of bad blood between the original author and  
Automattic, though he's never very specific, but it would be a real  
shame if this plugin were to die.

Stephen

P.S. -- I do have some ideas for small improvements, but I do _not_  
know enough to maintain the core of the system -- the part that  
actually out maneuvers the $%@^*& spammers.

Thanks for the tips Otto.

However, I'm still not sure what is going on here.

This works fine.

Yes, it is.

I can even call wp_publish_post()  and/or 
check_and_publish_future_post() manually and it publishes the post 
properly.
After manually monitoring the cron array, it can definitively say it is 
just not getting added to it at all.

Now, my question is, where in wp_write_post(), wp_insert_post(), or 
anywhere else for that matter, does the future publishing of a post get 
scheduled?? I can't seem to find it. Sorry if it's obvious.

Thanks for the help.

It's not that obvious, actually.

wp_insert_post() calls wp_transition_post_status(), and the
wp_transition_post_status function does this:
do_action("${new_status}_$post->post_type", $post->ID, $post);

This is hooked by these:
add_action('future_post', '_future_post_hook', 5, 2);
add_action('future_page', '_future_post_hook', 5, 2);

Which then calls this:
function _future_post_hook($deprecated = '', $post) {
	wp_clear_scheduled_hook( 'publish_future_post', $post->ID );
	wp_schedule_single_event(strtotime($post->post_date_gmt. ' GMT'),
'publish_future_post', array($post->ID));
}

And there you go.

Well, not really. Very easy fix.

I just need to register a new action with my post_type.

Message-ID: <13af0b630807141029x54e6e0abxc4659cac580abd39@mail.gmail.com>

Time after time, I get more annoyed with plugins forcing me to embed CSS.
 There ought to be a way to easily offer an option to link to a stylesheet
rather than forcing me to embed the CSS.
Even offering an option to "disable embedded CSS" and I'll add it myself,
even that would be fine.  but it seems like every plugin that uses CSS
forces uses to embed CSS, or nearly every plugin.

anyone else have thoughts on this subject?

Sincerely,

Sociable adds a stylesheet, and doesn't even do that by default...  
Easy enough to code... Just laziness on the Plugin writers side.

Joost,

Ah, gotcha.  So, that said, it's laziness, yes I realize that.  But,
is there a standard we might be able to impose so that this doesn't
happen?  Maybe even something within the WP Core for plugin devs to
utilize?

I just feel there has to be a better way to do it than how it's
currently being done...

Sincerely,

Jonathan Dingman

Spam Karma is a great plugin, but it's outdated and there are much
better plugins available to do the same job.

Akismet + Bad Behavior is a great combo.  Stop the spam before it gets
to you, then the spam that does get through, gets caught by Akismet.
I don't really see a need for Spam Karma anymore.

I recently abandoned SK after it let through what I can only describe  
as a chat session between what I assume was a bunch of schoolkids.  
Seems it was confused by them putting the post URL in the commenter's  
URL box, so it decided to whitelist them...

if there were a way to make an action hook, with which you could add  
some css... But that would mean having a PHP generated style sheet  
somewhere...

What's wrong with wp_head? That's a standard hook in the header. Of course,
there's nothing that enforces a theme developer put the wp_head() function
before the closing </head> but most do I think.

function plugin_css()
{
  echo '<link rel="stylesheet" href="' . ABSPATH .
'/wp-content/plugin/your-very-nice-plugin/customstyle.css" type="text/css"
/>';
}
add_action('wp_head','plugin_css');

I know that's what I do, get's you multiple linked files though... If  
there were a mechanism in which you could add some css, and that would  
ALL be added to 1 big css file, that'd save a couple of includes. But  
anyway, Jonathan had a problem with it, I don't :)

Cheers,
Joost

Sounds like maybe what we need is a wp_enqueue_style() for themes and build
that functionality as an automatic hook on wp_head(). I know last month when
this was being discussed on the wp-admin side, the argument was that theme
authors aren't consistent with how they develop themes and that it wasn't
our place to be enforcing those kinds of restrictions (my words not
whomever).

However, gut instinct says that 99% of publicly available themes have the
wp_head() functionality so why don't we leverage that to bring some
structure to bear without enforcing "rules" on those free-spirited designer
types. :-)

Jonathan,

I think there are two types of WP users:

     1. those who fear editing style.css and don't care/know about
        having an extra http call, and
     2. those who know how to edit files and care about the performance
        issues.

Plugins are written for both types of these users, therefore the best
solution is to add user-side CSS automatically with an option (within
plugin settings) to remove it.

On a sidenote -- I really thinkg that WP should have an inbuilt js/css
compressor/minifier for static js/css files. I use PHP Speedy plugin on
my blog but there are many php solutions out there.

With the increasing number of different js libraries and jQuery plugins
that plugin authors use, it will soon become a greater bottleneck than
the dynamic php and all the related caching issues.

Regards,
Kaspars

I personally find it annoying to have a whole extra stylesheet
included just to get a few lines of CSS, especially when the code
isn't even public-facing. The extra io probably isn't worth the
aesthetic benefits of a seperate sheet. IMHO it's more important to be
very selective about where you include the CSS at all (i.e. whether
it's needed on that pageload, rather than including it on all admin
screens etc).

It would be great to be able to selectively add a few lines of CSS to
the main admin stylesheet (or a second one) when it doesn't deserve
it's own file.

Sounds good to me! It's as easy as stacking all those requests on top  
of each other, and sending that out with the correct header, maybe  
minifying it in the process.

There is wp_enque_style() in WP 2.6 already. See:

Sounds like the demand is there, anyone feel like cooking something  
up? Sounds like a bigger patch then I've ever done to core so far ;)

Kaspers, you make some great points that yeah, there are 2 types of
Wordpress users.

That's why I'm suggesting there ought to be a standard for the
option.  Giving both types of users the ability to achieve what they
want to, with optimal performance.

Embedded CSS is just extra load time, as small as it is, to the
browser and end-user, when instead that same CSS could be cached.

Aaron,

I didn't know there was a function in 2.6 already for it, that sounds
great!  I can definitely live with how it is right now, it's just not
at optimal performance.

Jeremy,

That's why I suggested something for plugin devs to offer a "do not
include CSS" so you can manually add it yourself to whatever CSS file,
we use css/all.css, and the plugin wont add it anywhere.  makes sense
to me to offer that kind of functionality, on a global scale.

Thanks for the thoughts and contributions guys, greatly appreciated.

Yes, it does work outside admin area. I just tried, but couldn't figure
out how to order the stylesheets.

Same as with the script enqueing, you use dependencies.

wp_register_style('parent','/path/to/parent.css',array(), '1.0' );
wp_register_style('child','/path/to/child.css',array('parent'), '1.0' );

wp_enqueue_style('child');

The child depends on the parent, so the result will be the parent
first followed by the child.


However, contrary to what you said, I don't think that it is rigged to
work outside of the admin yet. I can't find where it would hook in.

This means it would add multiple css files instead of one big one?

Otto, you are right -- it won't work outside the admin area. I was using
the updated php speedy plugin (with 2.6 rc1) which hooks immediately
into the enqueued list of css/js files and looking at the output of the
combined css file.

Sorry for the confusion.

Yes. However, that would be the way you want it. If you were
generating CSS files on the fly, you'd have caching problems.

Message-ID: <1fa535a70807141553j40a1fe30p538f9309e2ec8e82@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I was under the impression that the 2.3 branch would continue to
receive security fixes so a blog could continue running on 2.3.x (for
the forseeable future anyway) and not upgrade to 2.5. Maybe it's just
me being stupid and this isn't the case at all, but I know for sure
that there are other people who think this too.

I have a blog running 2.3.3. Is this now considered an insecure version?

Regards,
John.

I think your impression probably comes from the 2.0 legacy branch:

http://wordpress.org/download/legacy/

The way I understand things, if you want to be up-to-date with regard  
to security, you need to run either the latest 2.0.x or a 2.5.x release.

Yes, just like 2.1.x and 2.2.x, your version is considered insecure and you
should update. There's no reason not to anyway really as unlike 2.2 to 2.3,
only very, very few plugins were broken by 2.5.

Plus 2.5 is faster, causes less load, and has tons of great new features.

CSS files go into cache -- is it really such a problem in that  
regard?  just askin'.

My Pull-quotes plugin has an option to "not link CSS".  It is quite  
simple to add such an option -- add the settings, and then wrap the  
CSS hook in an if( $setting ).  I actually did it at the request of a  
user.  Took me five minutes.

I think this is a matter of education more than throwing out more hooks.

I may just feel another article coming on.... ;-)

Yes, but Spam Karma with the Akismet plugin (i.e. Akismet running as  
one of the many tests in Spam Karma) is better than Akismet alone.   
I've been using that for quite a while....

A quick search of the CVE database 
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=wordpress> doesn't show 
any 2.3.3 specific issues. However, password hashing etc. got much 
better in 2.5, amongst many other things, so it's totally your call.

With the release of WordPress 2.6, as I'm sure you all know, default
gravatars can be defined in options-discussion.php.

I wonder if an option should be added to define your own custom gravatar,
as can be done manually in a comments.php:

<?php echo get_avatar( $comment, 50,
'http://mydomain.com/path/to/images/avatar.png' ); ?>

So I propose that an option should be added to either upload a custom
default gravatar, or to define the path to your custom gravatar. I prefer
the first.

Well, I don't know, there might some people out there who'd rather not
have all their comments be handled by a third-party company through a
closed-source service. Keeping one's comment on one's server.

No offense to Matt & the whole Akismet devteam, it's a great product
(I myself use it as a plugin to SpamKarma), but Jonathan, I'm sure you
can understand that there are cases when it does'nt fit the bill.
Furthermore, SK is built so that there is no chance to get false
positives, whereas Akismet might get a few from times to times (hence
the need to regularly check the spam folder of one's Akismet
installation).
In the end, you combine BadBehavior with Akismet, and I combine SK
with AK. To each his own, and I for one would be sad to see SK
disappear.

And know that no service/plugin is perfect: I just got an obvious spam
on my installation (author is "milfdude duuuude"),  see the
spam-comment's final karma points:

Karma : 6.07 with...
0.5: Valid Javascript payload (can be fake).
0: Encrypted payload valid: IP matching.
-1.43: Entry posted 1 year, 9 months ago. 0 comments in the past 15
days. Current Karma: 0.
7: Akismet says it's ok

:)

So, you'll always have to look at your spam folder, either to retrieve
possible false positives, or mark missed spam. No solution is perfect
yet, sadly.

See, I've heard this a lot, and I don't understand people's problem
with this whole concept. The idea of sending comments to a service to
have them scanned for spam makes far more sense to me, because that
centralized system can compare comments from all over the place, and
detect automated spammers much faster because of that.

Question: Are you against the whole concept of distributed computing
or webservices as well? For example, at my real-life job, we use a
third party service to get real-time sales tax rate information based
on addresses. We pay a small fee per lookup. This is better than
trying to do it all ourselves because there's 18000 tax jurisdictions
in this country and trying to keep up with changing rates and laws and
such is not worth our time. If we were huge and had lots of sales,
then maybe it would be worth the effort, but hey, maybe not.

The idea of contracting out a particular specific service to a
specialist makes sense to me. Why does it bother you to contract out
your comment spam-scanning to Akismet?

(This is not a question about the relative effectiveness of various
methods, mind you, just the specific idea of handling it with a third
party.)

whether we move to some sort of built-in caching system or just some
integrated CSS-single file function would be great.  something to
centralize everything and make it perform better.

Please re-read: I wrote "there might some people out there who'd
rather not", not "I want it that way". I myself do not have an issue
with that - hey, I'm using the Akismet plugin for Spam Karma, which
means that smelly comments are further tested through Akismet...

Myself, I still use and recommand SK because I've always been using
it, it hardly ever fails me, I like the developer's blog, and have
even met him at a bloggers meeting in Paris.
I also like Matt's blog, and have met him in Paris too, but anyway...

> Question: Are you against the whole concept of distributed computing

I'm not at all against this concert, as you understand now. I'm
against the death a good code that still gets the job done (and
well-done in my opinion), and am against the lack of alternative.

> Not to mention that a closed-source spam filtering application is theoretically harder

I know that, and it's an obvious advantage to open-source solutions,
that's for sure.
Now, playing the devil's advocate, wouldn't some people like to know
why their own comments are treated? :)

Just sayin'. I think there's a place for both solutions.

I think browser caching is better than server caching in this case.   
If the CSS is dynamically generated at the server, it is "new" every  
time -- or at less more frequently, as it changes from page to page.

Again, if the plugin already has an admin page, it is _very_ easy to  
add "don't link CSS" as an option.  I think plugin author education is  
the key here.

Browser caching is almost always better than this sort of thing, the
problem is that many web developers don't understand caching and
headers and such properly, and so they end up implementing straight-up
ridiculous solutions to problems that have already been solved.

One of the worst I've seen is these "CSS compressor" things. Instead
of using proper caching methods to avoid sending the data every time,
they end up doing useless things like preprocessing them to remove
whitespace, sticking them all together to eliminate extra http
connection overhead. The result is that they do a lot of processing on
every request and send that one (smaller) file repeatedly, instead of
sending it one time only and never sending it again until it actually
changes.

I admit that the notion of processing your data to improve size and
speeds has it's place, but the benefits are so tiny by comparison to
simply getting your friggin' cache headers correct that it's almost
not worth the trouble.

Yeah, I've run into that false positive situation as well where SK
will block it but the positive points from the Akismet SK plugin will
push it over and let it through.

I ended up mofifying the Akismet SK plugin so that a spam indication
from Akismet still gives negative karma points, but an "OK" from
Akismet does not add any karma points. Works pretty well that way.

Viper, on looking at your link (I was in a hurry earlier and apparently
didn't read it or the trac ticket properly), it appears that theme authors
will be able to define a gravatar to *match their theme*.

What I was intending was theme independent, much like the default options
now available.

No UI for it made it into 2.6 as Ryan wanted it to be done properly -- i.e.
an upload box. See this ticket: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6802

However, you can still add your own via the filter as documented in my
previous link. It's really simple and you can just drop that bit of code
into your theme's functions.php or a plugin.

Alex: it's a filter, so really it has nothing to do with the theme. I was
merely suggesting in my post that theme authors should add that bit of code
to their theme's functions.php file to provide a default avatar that matched
their theme.

The code works exactly the same if you were to stick it into a tiny plugin
(or your own theme's functions.php which is probably easier).

An array of default Gravatars to pick from gets passed through the
avatar_defaults
filter at which point you can modify it (i.e. add your own).

Message-ID: <91df29a20807160248j33390ec9m351112e96545ce1b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry for the little off-topic.

I want that when I click in "Publish", it redirects to another page
with two parameters in the URL. One of them is the contents of the
TinyMCE textarea.

Problem is that I get the alert popup stating:

"Are you sure you want to navigate away from this page?
Press OK to continue, or Cancel to stay on the current page."

I believe this prevents the text from being passed to the page I want.

I'm working on this for two days and I can't get this to work.

Any help would be very, very appreciated.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

Why do it via JS? Why not just do it via PHP? After publish, redirect to the
URL.

Friends of WP,

I have to import content via XML files. 

My idea is to build a XSLT transformation to the specific form of 
"WordPress eXtended RSS Format".

Does anyone of you have some documentation about the WordPress eXtended 
RSS DTD? 
How does an RSS item to look like for importing, the post, categories, 
images, meta information etc.?

Kind regards from sunny bavaria

Just install WordPress somewhere and then do an export. It should be pretty
clear pretty quick. :)

Although personally I think it'd be a lot, lot faster (and better) to make
your XML file into an RSS format. That way you can just import it via the
RSS import feature.

interesting starting point!
But how to make sure to get an "maximum" view into the export file?

I'll do some tests to see how the structre will be when using
meta, encl files, categorie etc.

but is there no DTD definiton for this WP RSS format?

Start with the WXR base class I wrote.
http://technosailor.com/2008/01/28/wordpress-export-base-class/

Then treat the project as atypical "WP importer" project where you have the
problem of exporting from source to importing to WordPress. The base class
will take care of the importing to WordPress part. Then all you have to do
is write an "exporter" that wil parse through your XML.

It does make *a lot* of sense, at least for me. I've done it with a  
custom class before, migrating several custom CMS into WordPress WXR,  
and this method is quite awesome, also because you can deal with  
everything using custom fields.

Anyway, I can't download your code to see it.. Maybe it's my fault?

Re: Re: [wp-hackers] WordPress eXtended RSS DTD






Start with the WXR base class I wrote.
http://technosailor.com/2008/01/28/wordpress-export-base-class/

Then treat the project as atypical "WP importer" project where you have 
the
problem of exporting from source to importing to WordPress. The base class
will take care of the importing to WordPress part. Then all you have to do
is write an "exporter" that wil parse through your XML.

Make sense?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is get_plugin_data "expensive"?
Message-ID: <69707359-56CA-42CE-B913-CA95458A0363@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

Question for more experienced PHP users:

I'm working on a function whereby a plugin stores the version of  
itself that was last used.  This way, if it has been updated it can  
(for example) set the defaults on any new options that have been added  
since the last version.

The plugin's settings are stored in an array in the options table, and  
the "last used version" is part of that, so there is no extra call to  
the DB since the array is being read out anyway.

However, to do the comparison, I have to get the current version of  
the plugin too, and to do that I need to use get_plugin_data().

The question is:  Is that a bad idea?  get_plugin_data() reads the  
actual plugin file for its info -- is that an "expensive" function in  
terms of performance?  Would it be bad if several plugins were doing it?

(BTW, yes I know I could just hook this to the activation hook, but  
when people upgrade plugins by simple upload, that doesn't trigger  
deactivate/activate.)

Thanks,
Stephen

Well, it's certainly more expensive than simply having a variable
which you update every time you release a new plugin...

$my_version = 1.2;

:)

There's definitely something wrong, I can't even get DNS resolution on
svn.wp-plugins.org now.

Heh.  Yeah, I know.  Sometimes I go to extremes with the whole "never  
repeat data" rule.  I hate duplicating this kind of thing, because  
inevitably you do an update and forget that one variable further down  
that _also_ needs to be changed.

Actually, for my purposes, I may only have to update the variable when  
there's a change to the defaults (such as a new option introduced).   
Kind of like $wp_db_version in WP....

Message-ID: <EFCBF3A9-C058-4A81-AC45-3CB430275D56@anschitech.de>

Hi all,

I updated my blog to WP 2.6. Today I wrote an article with two  
pictures. I used the WP Editor with the graphical mode. I uploaded  
two pictures using the Flash-Uploader.
In the settings the folder "figures" is set for uploaded media.
The uploader placed the pictures in the right folder but for the  
links of the pictures the uploader placed the default location "wp- 
content/uploads". I had to correct the urls by hand.
Anybody seen this too?

Andr?

Indeed.  I just spoke with the registrant and got the domain renewed.   
It should start coming back up for people today or tomorrow.

If you have a custom folder for uploads, then you also need to set the
URL to that folder. Settings->Miscellaneous, top two boxes.

If one of them is filled in, you have to fill in the other one too.

We are going to use this opportunity to move the plugins repo to a new  
server and a new domain name.  It is a long overdue project.  The old  
URLs will still work (once the domain resolves), but if you are  
hitting the old server, the svn repo will be read-only.

Might be nice, once the new domain/server is set up, to provide a  
helpful error message to plugin authors who try to commit stuff to  
svn.wp-plugins.org

Instead of "403 Forbidden" do "403 Please see http://codex.wordpress.org/BLAH 
" or something like that.

Oh, thats another issue.  I can see about making the 403 message more  
friendly in general.

You can also just make it a constant and put it right up next to where 
you set the main version number. Less likely yo forget (although I 
definitely have still forgotten).

The plan is to point the current wp-plugins.org domain to the new  
server (once its fully setup) so that shouldn't be an issue.

Here's an offtopic question. Has anyone created a simpledb db.php class?
Ironically, this is not for WordPress but a project I want to do using
backpress. Might be fun to do the project with SimpleDB as opposed to MySQL
for offsite storage that has volume, but not necessarily high traffic...

I am using the german version of Wordpress. The second box is labeled  
"(optional)". So I thought that it is indeed optional. ;)
But why are there two boxes, when they need to have the same content?  
Does not make any sense to me.
Anyhow, thanks for the hint.

It IS optional. If left blank, WordPress will just use the default URL.

But obviously if you want it different, you need to fill it in. ;)

The move is complete and everything should be working.  If you have  
any problems, can you please email me directly? (my email address  
isn't hard to figure out)

What's the point in having an undocumented export format? How is this  
any better than just giving easy access to SQL dumps!? If the idea of  
WXR is to allow easy movement between different blogging packages,  
then it has miserably failed (with only one major package implementing  
it as either an importer or exporter); if the idea of WXR is to have a  
format to move data between WP blogs, then it is very inefficient  
(both in terms of space and in terms of processing speed). If the idea  
is the former, then would it not have been better to go through some  
standardization process instead of just shipping a single normative  
implementation?

Sure, I could setup a WP blog and play around with things like whether  
the title element is HTML or text (this is ambiguous in the RSS  
specification ? and WXR is supposedly a subset thereof, and therefore  
will need to allow either), but I have better things to do. I could  
just go and write a generic AtomPub importer in the same time it'd  
take me just to work out what WXR actually is, yet alone implement it.  
Neither RSS nor Atom is particularly nice to implement.

Oh, and if I'm wrong and there is any documentation (and don't say "go  
read the comments in the code": that isn't how you document a file  
format. Take a look at RFC4287 or HTML 5: that's how you define a  
format.), then make it more obvious that is actually exists. I'm not  
going to implement something that I don't know exists.

That was never the idea behind WXR, as far as I know. The idea was to
make it easy to move between different WordPress installations and
WordPress.com. Other blogging platforms were not considered.

WXR is basically just RSS with some additional fields added to it for
things like comments and such.

Basically, it is simple enough that I think nobody has bothered to
document it yet. Your request for high levels of documentation seems,
to me, to be more than a little silly. Just *looking* at the damn
thing would show you that it doesn't need an extreme amount of effort
to produce.

If you want it documented, then look at it and write a document for it.

ok.
Still: when I want my files stored in a special directory, what sense  
does it make to generate links to an other directory than that where  
the files are stored?
To me this is a bug. I do not see where this could be a feature.

   Andr?

I think it's a regression/bug of some type. Because I'm fairly sure
that changing the first setting but leaving the second one blank
worked before.

Otto is correct. WXR was designed for moving between or merging WordPress
installs. That's not to say other blogging/CMS software couldn't use it to
import rather than doing an import via the DB, but I don't believe that was
it's initial purpose.

Yet Geoffrey is right too. The good thing with using XML is that it
helps portability, yet without a proper DTD, WXR is as useful to other
projects as a straight file-dump would be.

It would be nice to have that, getting adoption of the format
elsewhere would be very nice IMHO.

I recommend (as have others) using Spam Karma with the SK Akismet  
plugin.

Akismet working within Spam Karma is a powerful combination.

I don't think SK can be said to be an alternative to BB, they don't
really work on the same level.
That being said, a BB-like service could probably be built as an
SK-plugin. hinthintwinkwinknudgenudge, anyone? :)

I only have passing time to contribute to anything including  
discussions.

I didn't notice if anyone considered merging Akismet and SK as part of  
an anti-spam package that would ship with WordPress. I understand  
there is some "history" with the SK developer, but I really try not to  
pay attention, and (as the subject line reads) SK is now GPL.

Could this leverage communications for spam detection? Somebody is  
going to blast me for this one... Could that also improve data  
collected by Akismet?

Really? Okay, then please point out where the *official* RSS2 DTD file
resides, eh?

Sure, you can find one people made, but the scheme itself got wide
acceptance without one. You don't need a DTD to read a file, a DTD is
only really for validation, and even then it doesn't really validate
the data, just the format.

Bad Behavior works fine on GoDaddy shared hosting. I used to use it myself.

That said, I stopped using it because I found that it was no longer
particularly effective. I switched to Simple Trackback Validator for
preventing a lot of incoming trackback spam, and that has helped
considerably.

All these bunches of narrow minded fanboys floating around. Heh.

There DO exist cases where comment handling by 3rd party is not
desired, say asking for support on commercial services. Yes, most
serious business wouldn't be daring enough to even trying using
blogging systems for business use, but there are some small startups
doing exactly this thing. They absolutely don't want customers'
request being filtered as spam, and want to do quality assurance
themselves instead of blindly trusting 3rd parties.

Not everybody must follow your method of handling matters, they have
the freedom and choice too.

 >>Bad Behavior works fine on GoDaddy shared hosting.<<

That's really strange, because any time I've used it on GoDaddy (maybe  
it's a certain type?  Like the "free" hosting account?  but then  
again, WP won't install on that...hmmm...) it would *always* bounce  
people out, and give that error message when it thinks you're a  
spammer.  Maybe it's something else on the server, then.

 >>Akismet working within Spam Karma is a powerful combination.<<

Yes, that's what I do for clients that can't use BB - but if SK2 isn't  
being developed anymore, then I think I'll need to find an alternate.   
(Although I *love* it...I hate to see it go - which I hope it  
doesn't.  I'm not good enough to take it over myself, or I'd be all  
over it.)

Back in 2003, Meg Hourihan was writing the now-defunct Kinja.com, and

Her rant relates to attributes and all that. Basically, XML that can
be extended. However, the solution to her problem is XML namespaces.
Which WordPress uses correctly in the export file.

A WXR file is a valid RSS 2.0 file. It has extra data in it, which all
takes the form of new tags in the wp: namespace. A parser that doesn't
understand that namespace would ignore it.

There's already an Image button above the toolbar. And if you play a bit 
with the editor, I'm sure you'll find the new Edit Image button :)

SK2 hasn't been updated (AFAIK) in over a year and it still works well 
for me!

I don't think that SK2 in it's current form is worth onward development 
- but the ideas that are there are very good.

I would like to get the ability in the core to hook multiple plugins 
into the comment processing process and allow SK2 style comment rating.

I use a global search and replace in my plugin build script that 
replaces SVN_VERSION with the current version number.

I'm in the process of converting one of my half WordPress-powered sites to
be fully WordPress. It currently uses a custom table and custom scripts to
output Page-like content. I will be transitioning this data to be actual
Pages and meta content.

However, I want to be able to search these Pages and only these Pages
(rather than posts and other Pages). Is this possible? Or do I need to
manually query?

More importantly though, how can I exclude these Pages for when I want to
search the posts (site news)?

Is it just a matter of playing with WP_Query or am I SOL?

Message-ID: <503625CF-EE3A-4F89-9DDA-6BF57B83CB79@anschitech.de>

Hello all,

I have on my site some pictures on a page which I display as an  
gallery via the [gallery]-tag.
When I click on a picture the picture will be displayed but above the  
picture I get an error that reads
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /path/to/wp/wp- 
includes/post.php on line 1908

I did find no information what could possibly be the source of that  
error. I use a custom theme. Do I need some special things in my  
theme? Or is it a WP-Bug?

   Andr?

I doubt that plugin will work, but it's given me the inspiration / guidance

Hello! I am having a problem with conditional tags:


add_action('init', 'js_loader');

function js_loader(){
  if ( is_home() )
    wp_enque_script('script_name', 'script_src', array('dependencies'));
}


The condition in the if clause is never true. What should I change to
enque a script only on the home page?

That looks like it should work (at least the is_home() part). Are you
running extra or modified loops on your homepage? That can throw off
is_home() as well as some of the other is_ functions.

Could it be that you're misspelling wp_enqueue_script ?

That will be false if you are testing it on a static front page. Test
is_front_page() if you are using a static front page.

I have achieved this by assigning the special pages their own post_type 
field in the database, and applying some filters to the posts_* hooks. I 
can elaborate more, if you'd like, however I'm about to pass out from 
exhaustion.

I wrote a version just using hooks that I'll release as a plugin when I have
some time to clean it up and add a configuration screen.

That opens a whole other can of worms though for what I'm doing when it
comes to displaying and managing the content. I might as well stick to my
current custom scripts.

Just a thought, Would it be possible to assign these pages a custom  
taxonomy(like a category or tags), and have your search page limit it to  
items within that taxonomy?

Another method i can think of, Which most likely will not work for you, Is  
to assign the pages to have a parent page which only acts as a stub,  
Allthough it takes a bit of effort to remove the stub from the permalink  
for the page..

And I have a domain mapping plugin 90% done, but without the remote 
login bit done. I must talk to Matt about making that code public.

@Austin Matzko: No, i didn't misspell it, because it works without is_home().

@Andy: I have tried it on a fresh install, with a single active plugin
that had this code:


add_action('init', 'js_loader');

function js_loader(){

	if ( is_category() )

		wp_enqueue_script('jquery');
}


If I remove the if condition, it works fine.

By the sound of it, The Query object hasnt been setup at the point that  
init hook is run.

Try hooking later, say onto template_redirect

I need them to be actual pages so I can display them without huge hacking.

And actually all of these pages will have a common parent.

This is the format I'm gonna move to pages:
http://www.finalgear.com/shows/topgear/11/4/   That's currently mod_rewrite
+ a custom script.

You might consider giving them all the same custom_value and create a quick
plugin that adds that meta value to search parameters... that would preserve
the post_type...just a though.

Good thinking! Sadly query_posts() doesn't accept meta parameters, but
that's still easier than using parent or whatever in the SQL filters
(post_where, etc.).

This actually brings up something I read some time ago (early 2008)  
that WordPress would be including Pages in searches. My apologies but  
I don't know if these ever made it into a official release.

For Categories and Tags there are some very nice taxonomy related  
settings:

category__in, category__not_in, category__in, category__not_in,  
category__and, tag__in, tag__not_in, tag__and

These can be easily used in the case of a search or whatever. I  
actually use them heavily for a plugin I wrote earlier Simply Exclude  
But for Pages one has to jump through some ugly action code to  
manipulate the SQL query itself. Ugly ugly stuff.

So for Pages it would be nice to have a similar set of settings like
page__in, page__not_in

Page searching has been in WordPress for quite a while. 2.5, possibly
earlier.

Because it was confusing to have two image buttons that did different
things and behaved in different ways.

I haven't had a good hard look at the code yet, but I plan to.

If anyone on this list is interested in the continued development of  
SK (and it seems there are many), it has an official page on Google  
Groups:

http://groups.google.com/group/sk2-gpl-dev/

Except on such as Peter's regarding rolling it into WordPress itself  
(something I would support)

Certainly the concept of multiple tests that are aggregated is a good  
one.  Any given test can be tricked, but the concept of Spam Karma is  
to roll multiple spam solutions into one and allow them to work in  
tandem.  More effective than each working separately.

Even if people here think the code is not up to snuff, the concept  
certainly is.

Again: http://groups.google.com/group/sk2-gpl-dev/

Ah, then I must've been mislead, in part at least by Matt's comment,  
"In fact it?d be nice if they [MT4] could export to WXR as well as  
it?s pretty semantically rich"[1]. He also said, in a comment,  
"However I still do plan to get a spec doc up for it one day." ? this  
was almost a year ago.

The problem with "just looking at the damn thing" is that I don't know  
whether the title element is text/plain or text/html (this is  
ambiguous in RSS 2.0, different aggregator implement different things,  
some using complex algorithms to determine which it is), I don't know  
where the comment author's name is text/plain or text/html.

So, I finally looked at the code you use to implement it for the first  
time in years: it isn't even XML! It's a XML-like text format! '<title  
foo:bar="heh>" xmlns:foo="tag:gsnedders.com,2008-07-21:WXR_b0rked">My  
amazing title</title>' should give 'My amazing title' as the content  
if parsed with an XML parser, yet your non-XML parser gives '"  
xmlns:foo="tag:gsnedders.com,2008-07-21:WXR_b0rked">My amazing title'.  
You just strip out <![CDATA[ and ]]> from the data, giving them  
absolutely no meaning. <category><![CDATA[&gt;foo>]]></category> and  
<category>&gt;foo></category> are two totally different categories  
(the former is '&gt;foo>', the latter is '<foo>').

It takes more effort than you seem to think, as I can't use a pre- 
existing XML tool-chain to manipulate it. When (seeming the intention  
is to spec it, so hopefully not "if") you define it, I hope it isn't  
defined as an XML format. It plainly isn't. Either define it to be  
what it is (a vaguely XML like format), or completely rewrite WP's  
currently normative implementation to create a backwards incompatible  
new version that is XML. There are a vast deal of differences from XML  
in it.

A DTD does next to nothing to actually document a format: it merely  
defines what elements are allowed in the document, and what attributes  
are allowed on what elements. They do nothing to actually define what  
the content of the element actually is. DTDs don't even support  
namespaces! Regardless, there is no point in having a DTD for WXR as  
it isn't XML. DOCTYPEs are all but dead
anyway, for reasons that are entirely irrelevant.

The progress bar I made should be pretty generic. I'm just clearing PHP's
output buffer each time I need to make an update (forcing the page to
display everything echo'd so far), and with one line of jQuery, I change the
width of the inner box of the progress bar.

I need to be able to have numeric stubs on a bunch of children pages.
However a bug is stopping me from doing so:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5305

How can I, assuming it's possible, remove the ability for multi-page posts
and Pages (I don't use that feature) so that I can have numeric stubs for
children Pages? Basically I want to work around the bug if it's possible by
giving up a feature I don't use.

This won't help if you only want numeric stubs on a certain subset of
pages, or if you want to specify the number shown, but have you
thought about changing your permalink settings to something like
/%post_id%/ ?

Oh wait, that might not even work on Pages. I think pages always use the slugs.

Correct, this is Pages.

Basically I need one Page to show up at /some-url/, another Page to show up
at /some-url/5/, and another at /some-url/5/11/ for example.

I see no reason you cant add a filter to the rewrite rules list, And  
remove any rules which reference paging, That'll disable all paging rules  
and hopefully let the query fall down onto a post-name rule.

Would that work do you think?

The other way, Is to add a rule to the *start* of the rules list of
(top-page)/(\d+)/(\d+) => index.php?pagename=$3
Or whatever similar works, That way your rule will be matched before all  
the paging rules are met

This reminds me of a feature in rewrite.php which matches numeric
stubs on attachments by adding a rewrite rule for the explicit form:
/page-slug/attachment/numeric-slug/
e.g.
/about/attachment/53/

This also required some logic in the functions that create attachment
permalinks, basically to detect an all-numeric slug and add
"/attachment" in the path.

You probably don't want to add to the path, so let's assume you'd
rather get rid of the rules that match the paged pages. Filter
page_rewrite_rules.

Cheers,
Andy

Message-ID: <20080722232653.po1nmca7kogckksw@www.dimensionmedia.com>

Greetings.

I manually inserted 3000 pages into wp_posts (and associated data into  
wp_postmeta) via mysql (because this was much faster than entering the  
information via WP backend). The problem is that the website is taking  
a *LONG* time pulling up the pages and I have determined it's only  
slow when i activate my custom permalink:

/%category%/%postname%

So this is very slow:

www.samplesite.com/state/california/los-angeles/finalpage

When i revert to default permalinks, there's no problem:

http://www.samplesite.com/?p=1400

The big question is why. Did i miss something when i added the info (I  
correctly inputted gui info for each item added)? Can anyone venture a  
clue? It's been driving me out of my mind so much i'm willing to  
compensate someone for their time if they can look and give me a  
defining answer. Thanks.

Message-ID: <op.uep7o62fk6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

Good day everyone,
Theres been a lot of people lately wanting some form of control over the  
Revision functionality in WordPress 2.6, Many do not like the idea of  
defining a Cosntant in their config file mearly to disable the revisions.

In response i've written up a plugin which allows you to define the  
setting from the WordPress aministration interface on a Global basis (ie.  
Disable All revisions for all posts/pages, And override on a per-page/post  
basis.

For example, I can set Revisions to Disabled globally, And then Enable it  
to store say 5 revisions for a Specific page(Without affecting any other  
pages)

You'll find some Info ( & Download link) on it here:  
http://dd32.id.au/wordpress-plugins/revision-control/

Note: Yes, Those of you who look at the source will see i've skipped over  
some API methods, Theres reasons for most of them.
MU Compatibility: No, This is not MU Compatible - Well, At least I dont  
think it is, I have not written it for MU, I might update it if i can work  
out the changes needed.

I'd appreciate any suggestions and/or bug reports for V1.1

You need to include either the post_id or some other numeric data in  
your permalink recipe or else it has to look through all the slugs for  
a match - this is why its slow.

Try this tried and true recipe instead: /%category%/%post_id%/%postname 
%/

Got it sorted (finally). My regex skills suck, but this seems to do the
trick, so whatever. :)


function allow_numeric_stubs( $rules ) {
    unset( $rules['(.+?)(/[0-9]+)?/?$'] );

    $rules['(.+?)?/?$'] = 'index.php?pagename=$matches[1]';

    return $rules;
}

add_filter( 'page_rewrite_rules', 'allow_numeric_stubs' );

Subject: [wp-hackers] [gsoc] WordPress PHP Extension
Message-ID: <4887264D.1010301@santosj.name>

I'm currently writing a PHP Extension for WordPress, which converts the 
WordPress library to C++. I was wondering if I should create private 
functions, in which WordPress tests for and uses if available. Sort of 
like what another PHP library does. The advantage of this way is that it 
will only require a patch to WordPress to test if the extension is 
active and use it. My current implementation will require that you 
remove the functions or files from WordPress, since I'm implementing 
them in C++.

The former has the advantage of not requiring that much maintenance and 
could be further optimized using C/C++ algorithms instead of PHP ones. I 
don't want to develop something like that and then be told that such a 
patch will not be acceptable.

I'm currently going to be working on converting the Plugin API, which is 
used a lot. I might as well try the Walker classes, since they are also 
slow currently and I could get some good benchmarks out of it.

Does anyone have suggestions on what WordPress library component I 
should convert to the WordPress PHP Extension? I only have 3 and a half 
weeks of development time left.

What is the correct and forward compatible way to call
load_plugin_textdomain() inside a plugin? Assume that I want the .mo
files to be inside the plugin's own directory and not in a lang
directory or some such thing.

The codex and documentation is less than clear on this point, and the
code is somewhat difficult to understand.

I just worked this out yesterday.

This works for me, with .mo in a /languages/ folder inside the plugin  
folder:

$plugin_dir = basename(dirname(__FILE__));
load_plugin_textdomain( 'myplugin', 'wp-content/plugins/'. 
$plugin_dir.'/languages', $plugin_dir.'/languages' );

I'm sure you can adjust that for the .mo in the base plugin folder. ;-)

To clarify this:

load_plugin_textdomain( $domain, $path_from_abspath,  
$path_from_plugins_folder )

The second parameter is the path to the .mo file, relative to  
ABSPATH.  This method is ***deprecated***, in favor of the third  
parameter.

The third parameter (which will override the second) is the relative  
path of the .mo file from the /plugins/ folder, e.g. "myplugin" or as  
above, "myplugin/languages"

Thats not very compatible with 2.6 & custom wp-content directories.

load_plugin_textdomain('domain',
PLUGINDIR.'/'.dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__)),
dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__)));

The second argument is the path to the MO file, relative to ABSPATH.
Since 2.6 the plugin dir can be changed, so we introduced a third
argument, which is the path, relative to the plugins directory (e.g.
wp-content/plugins). This argument is deprecated, but will work at
least until 2.7.

If both arguments are supplied, the third one takes precedence.

If your plugin doesn't have to be compatible with WordPress < 2.6, you
can leave false for the second argument, to save some typing.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Putting in the third parameter, as I did, works just fine with WP  
2.6.  The third parameter is relative to the plugin folder, and thus  
moves with it.

If I'm not mistaken, WP generates 3000x4 rewrite rules for your pages, 
that's why it's so slow.

To avoid this, you can set $wp_rewrite->use_verbose_page_rules in false 
and then use a slight different permalink structure 
"/posts/%category%/%postname%" -- I've used this hack to solve a similar 
problem.


Best regards.

If you start the structure with 'posts' instead of  '%category%',
use_verbose_page_rules should automatically be set to false.

Starting permalink structures with wildcards such as %postname%,
%category%, %tag%, and %author% means we have to use verbose rules to
avoid rewrite collisions.  Putting taxonomy tags in your structure
also means you can accidentally 404 posts when you change categories
or tags after publishing.  Plus, categories in permalinks is so early
00s, back when posts were given one category.  Now posts must be given
a full taxonomic infusion of categories and tags to be cool. ;-)

Thanks for the clarification, I didn't realize about that.

Does this still count true for date based posts?
Like /%year%/%month%/%postname%/
?

No, %year% does not cause the verbose rules to be created.  %year% is
much more constrained than %category%.  It matches against only 4
consecutive digits rather than any sequence of alphanumerics..  This
can cause conflicts with pages named '2008', for example, but is
otherwise well-behaved.

Hi everyone! 
	
These last few days I have received a large amount of spam (all intercept by 
Akismet) via an IP in particular (194.116.229.5).

We restrict access to any IP that my domain through apache.
<Limit GET HEAD POST>
Order deny,allow
Deny from 194.116.229.5
</Limit>

Is there any way to configure in WordPress for some IP's unable to post 
comments?
If there could be a new feature?

Hey all -

I have two questions, if someone can just give me a nudge in the right  
direction.

1) I'm doing a site for a client, and I'm a little stuck.  They want  
to add a blog to their site.  The problem is, most of the site is  
already using a custom-made CMS, and the URL they want to blog to  
appear at already has an index.php file there that they don't want to  
give up.  If I install WP where they want it, he WP index.php file  
will override the page they have there - and they don't want that.   
They also don't want to convert this one page to make it the WP index  
page.  SO I was wondering if there were any other options I could take  
on to give them what they want, or if I need to *insist* they let me  
put the index page within WordPress, or move the blog down a level.   
(I think it's the latter, but I wanted to be absolutely sure before I  
gave them this ultimatum.)

2) I'm compressing 20 blogs into one.  Right now, I'm converting the  
individual bloggers into categories on this single blog.  I *think* I  
can move the posts over from each individual blog and assign them to  
these individual users on the one blog.  But the question comes in  
where each of these users post on the site.  I want to restrict each  
user to a single category.  I can see a way to d this: the user names  
are actually *exactly* the same name as the category I want to post  
them in (for example, I want user John Smith to writ *only* to the  
category named "John Smith" - the category slug is different, however  
- it's "sd_smith")  I *think* i can write a little function for this  
(since most plugins I've found are either too much, or not what I  
need) that would check the author's name against what category he's  
selected when he hits the "publish" button.  Just basically do a  
preg_match or something.  Problem is, I don't quite know how to stop  
the posting function from going through, or how to stop it to check.   
(actually now that I think about it, I *could* just do author pages  
and "fake" the categories...hmmm...)

I was wondering if anyone here can point me in a direction to go for  
this.  (I'm not asking for you to do it for me - I've just been  
researching this for a coupe of weeks now, and I'm starting to think  
I'm looking for the wrong thing, because I can't find anything to help  
me, so it's time to ask.)  if there's like a plugin already written  
that stops the posting function - so I can look at it - that would be  
great.  Something like that, or suggestions on what you may have done,  
so I can cobble this together.

Thanks a bunch!

If your client will allow it, put a copy of the contents of the old
index.php into a file called home.php inside the theme directory (eg
/wp-content/themes/themename/home.php ) Then the homepage for the directory
they want to put it in will be the page they wanted, and the blog will still
operate behind it.

I don't know about the other question.

Hope this helps!

Thanks a bunch :)

I think they're caving in, LOL - they just emailed and are allowing me  
to "test it out" before they agree to it.  So #1 may be solved...now

Why not just make the 20 authors... authors?

WordPress makes a separate page per author.  Look at example.com/blog/ 
author/*username*

Any given author's posts are automatically listed under that author,  
and you can then use categories as... categories.  It's so crazy it  
just might work. ;)

That will leave the IP continue sending SPAM comments. Akismet intercepts this 
comments, there is no a improvement.

I'm boring that a single IP sending me SPAM between 1 or 2 per minute for 12 
hours a day.

My idea is to block the ability of such IP to send any comments en mi blog.

If all it's doing is spamming, what's the point in allowing it onto your
site? As soon as whatever it is realises that it can't comment, it'll go and
(probably) not come back. Therefore, unblocking the IP for visiting and
trying to block it from commenting is a wasted endeavour.
If you really wanted to, you could probably have an if statement that checks
the users IP against a blacklist in the text file and just doesn't show the
comment form, but that'd mess with caching and such.

Well, usually comments.php is not directly accessible, but is part of 
the theme. So using index.php should filter them from the beginning, 
avoiding waste of bandwidth :)

It should *actually* be wp-comments-post.php so that they can't post,
but we'll let it slide. This time. ;)

And frankly, I would not bother limiting it to commenting at all. If
somebody's hitting your blog and spamming you, why let them hit your
blog in the first place? Remove the files stuff entirely, block them,
and be done with it.

I have an issue with a plugin apparently not "hooking" all the time.

This particular plugin appends each article with a custom "author footer"
which is saved in each author's profile page to the db. It grabs the author
footer, and places it at the end of the_content on publish.

The problem is, that it doesnt always do it. It works about 1/3 of the time,
and I cant figure out why.

Here's the code over at wordpress.pastebin.com:
http://wordpress.pastebin.com/m71910a05

Any ideas why this is only partially working? Shouldnt it work every time a
post is published?
Would the "scheduled" posts to be published get the same action that a click
to the "Publish" button would?

Any help is appreciated.
Thanks,

Why are you directly modifying the post at all? If you think about it, 
this would work much better if you are just appending the data to each 
post when it is shown (I.E. hook to the the_content filter). The reason 
is simple: if the author ever changes their info, your current system 
doesn't have a method for updating the data that is already added to the 
posts.

hard (and I guess technically "wrong") way.

I think we decided for this route since prior to this plugin, the authors
were adding this to every post. Therefore, these "footers" are already
inputted into hundreds of posts already as part of "the_content".

Wouldn't this route duplicate those?

The filter wouldn't actually save the data in the post. Essentially, the 
post will remain just as it was input, but it will display with the 
author data added onto it. The function that you would hook to would use 
the data given to it to find the author information, use that to get the 
author data to be added, and then return the post data with the author 
data added to the end.

If you really want to stick with the original concept, your problem is 
that the action hook that you are using isn't a good one. It looks like 
the publish_post action hook hasn't been used (no corresponding 
do_action call anywhere) since 2.2.3. You say that your code works some 
of the time. I really don't know how that's possible since that hook 
doesn't get called. I am assuming that you are using at least a fairly 
recent of WordPress however.

The hook you most likely want to look into is the save_post action hook. 
You'll have to do some checks to see if you've modified the post or not, 
but that's a readily-solved problem.

Just do an ID check, i.e. only filter posts from here on out.

I am working on an expiration date plugin that will add a meta box to 
the post page, and use ajax to submit the data.  However, i'm having 
trouble getting the ajax portion to work.

My understand is that I have to print out some javascript using the 
"admin_print_scripts" action.  However, i'm not sure what exactly I 
should put there.

After that, I know it needs to hook into ajax-admin with the custom action.

Can anyone offer some thoughts or ideas?  Thanks!

Observation: the custom "author footer" could be saved in  
wp_usermeta, greatly simplifying your database access. See http:// 
codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_usermeta

That's a very nasty was to improve an API:
create another optional argument which overwrites the previous arguments?!

Not really. It allows for backwards compatibility and the option to use 
the new method, all in one pretty little package.

I've tried that, but then I get stuck with the following error popping 
up in the firefox error console:

Security Error: Content at 
https://myblog.edu/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=5 may not load 
data from http://myblog.edu/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php.

Any ideas?

You could have saved a lot of time by sending that error in the first 
place. Your problem is that you are doing cross-site scripting. Notice 
that you are trying to call http://myblog.edu... (not secure) from 
https://myblog.edu... (secure). That's your problem.

I'm pretty sure you cannot send an XHR request over HTTPS if your 
current connection is HTTP. You need to be using the same protocol.

Would you have rather broken everything that used the old way? I fail to 
see how this is an issue.

messy API is an issue.

in the long run, it's more costly to keep a messy API than to fix it once.


I believe I would have create a new function (different name) and 
deprecate the old one.

and completely remove it after a few major versions.

If he later saves the post again, won't it add a second footer?

I would use a filter, but add it only to posts last saved after  
today.  Then down the road if you ever edit a past post, you can  
delete the old footer and the new save date will flag it to show the  
new footer via filter. :)

I actually agree with Omry on this.  Deprecate and replace rather than  
have one function that works two different conflicting ways.

Hi all,

I've written a plugin that uses the [cb] shortcode, now I want to  
write down that exact shortcode in a post and NOT parse it, without  
disabling the plugin, how do I do that?

You can always wrap part of it in a useless tag. For example:

[<span>cb</span>]

As long as you pick something that your CSS won't modify, there won't be 
any visible change, but it will look the same. I frequently do this on 
forums that use BBCode.

Could you use numeric entities for the square brackets?

E.g. &;#91;cb&#93;

(Don't know whether that will work in an email.)

Why not just piggyback on the existing post or ajax-save-draft  
requests being made for the post itself?

Just double bracket it, like so: [[cb]]

It'll end up looking like this: [cb]

We will keep it just until 2.7. After that both argument will do what
the third one does now. And after 2.8 we will keep only the second
one.

Unfortunately there are too many plugins out there and we can't make
an abrupt transition. In our case, we can't afford make all plugin
translations to stop working.

Happy hacking,

Sorry, but the solution you just outlined will *not* help plugin 
developers avoid an abrupt transition.

Right now, you can make a plugin be compatible with both older and 
newer versions of load_plugin_text_domain, by including both 
arguments. Odd, but it works.

But if you what you describe below, it will no longer be possible to 
use the same function call and have it work in pre-2.8 as well as 2.8, 
and all plugins that haven't been updated to 2.8 will immediately 
break. Unless I am mistaken? If so, can you include a code sample of 
how to make it work with 2.8 and also 2.7? Not to mention 2.0, 2.1? 
(without doing version_compare, which I think is a messy cop-out)

Assuming I am not wrong about this, I agree with Omry and Stephen and 
others. You should make a totally new function with a different name, 
deprecate the old one, and eventually eliminate it, as has been done 
with lots of other WordPress functions.

And I don't want to start a discussion about whether plugin developers 
should support old versions of WordPress. Please.

?????  A half-assed transition is far worse than a straightforward  
one.  Transitioning to a different function will work the same as any  
number of existing transitions that have happened already with  
WordPress.

There is absolutely no purpose to changing the way the second  
parameter of that same function works.  Any old plugins that are still  
using the function will suddenly break.  The only possible outcome of  
that is confusion.

When the change does happen, it will be a _lot_ easier for authors to  
figure out that a function no longer exists, than that it exists but  
works slightly differently than it used to.

> we can't afford make all plugin translations to stop working.


That's _exactly_ what you're going to do when you subtly change the  
way an existing function works in a way that breaks existing  
implementations.

I'm working on a blog that has the front page as a static page, and
that page has children underneath it. Using is_front_page() appears to
return true for the front page, and it's children.

I'm assuming this isn't the intended behavior?

This *is* actually possible. You can simply rename WP's index.php to 
something like handler.php and change rewrite rules to use handler.php 
instead.

Subject: [wp-hackers] uploading and attaching images via plugin
Message-ID: <488B648C.4040503@pixelplexus.co.za>

Hi Guys

I've been building a plugin (aDirectoryManager) that 'composes' posts 
from a custom admin forms and then creates posts from the input  - 
basically to standardise format of layout and apply some rules to 
categorization and tagging of the resulting posts - nice results so far 
but still some ways to go before it'll be ready for release.

One issue that has been confounding me is the best way to deal with 
images (given that again the idea is all about highly structured and 
pre-determined format and lay-out). Should I build a separate *simple* 
uploader and use |wp_insert_attachment at time of 'exporting the post' 
|- or somehow use the wordpress system at data entry time - if so, would 
it allow programatically modifying settings for individual attachments 
etc.- if the latter makes more sense then how - at a glance I don't see 
much in terms of documentation.

Not sure I've articulated what I'm after very well but any pointers 
would be appreciated.

Thanx

Andr?

PS. wow, i managed to write all that without writing 'as aCMS' :)

Hi all,
I'm wondering if WP's built in "cron" feature is suitable for long
running processes? It's clear it takes a page hit to kick off the cron
process, but what's not clear (to me) is whether the visitor is forced
to sit there waiting until the cron job finishes.

Read the top of wp-cron.php:


WordPress Cron Implementation for hosts, which do not offer CRON or for
which
the user has not setup a CRON job pointing to this file.

The HTTP request to this file will not slow down the visitor who happens to
visit when the cron job is needed to run.

 From what I recall it spawns of a second HTTP request out-of-band of 
the user request to call the page.

So a long running process should not affect the user.

However,  you can only run for as long as the runtime limit set for your 
php pages by your host.

Message-ID: <e98dfae80807270321n4dbdf9f9t1459c3a112790a7f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need some help modifying the More Fields plugin and give the possibility
to my users to add fields to a definite form as they need. Since various
users will have n items to insert I cannot pre-define the number of fields
to be inserted. On the other side in More Fields each field has to have a
unique key to be called in the html, therefore the dynamic adding should
also be tied to a function that calls all the items listed in the form and
displays them wherever the function is placed, whether the function is
called n times or just once for the entire form.

Thank you for any pertinent reply

Thanks Westi.. That's just the info I was looking for. I'm hoping I
can skirt the runtime limit by using the set_time_limit() function.

In WordPress MU, where is the code that creates a new blog when a new  
user registers for one? I am trying to change the "welcome to xxx.  
This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start blogging!"  
message dynamically based on certain criteria (I don't want to change  
the default message in admin settings, in other words)?

Has anyone does this before (even in standard WP)? Thanks in advance!

This message and other default data are set up by calling the
wp_install_defaults function, which can be replaced by one of your own
definition.  One way to take advantage of this might be to add an
include statement to your wp-config.php file that evaluates a file, in
which you have defined a wp_install_defaults function that uses your
customized default text.

So redefine wp_install_defaults() in a file inside mu-plugins/.

Gotta agree, this was done wrong. A new function should have been
created instead of adding extra parameters. With the deprecated code
marking in 2.4 and up, plugin developers using debug mode would have
ample warning that their function was going to be deprecated and then
would be able to transition naturally. Instead, you've just shoved
back the problem until 2.7 or 2.8.

I highly recommend making a new function entirely and deprecating this
one entirely, and doing it now, not later.

Just to throw my hat into the discussion, I completely agree with this 
sentiment. Making a breaking change happen later while implementing a 
confusing change to the API which will require double the work to use 
currently is baffling. Just cut the cord and force developers to update 
their stuff. Code that breaks due to lack of support will be picked up 
and fixed by the people who want to use it if there is enough interest 
remaining.

Couldn't agree more.

I'd be in favor of "later", or even, sadly, never, since some pretty
useful widgets might just not be updated by their authors, or even
picked up/replaced by another dev. And since some users tend to not
know how/where to update their plugins, many might be out of luck once
the deed is done.

One idea I have (which might be silly or just plain undoable) would be
to build upon the well-received Notification Update message for
plugins, and have it blurt out a "Note: This widget uses deprecated
methods, and might not work in future WordPress versions." message,
which would only appear of there was no new version in sight.
This would probably be even better with a "WARNING: This widget uses
unavailable methods that might have been deprecated long ago. It might
therefore not work as expected with the version of WordPress you are
currently using. Try to find an alternative on the [Plugins
Repository]" message.
This could be a good and explicit way to deprecate methods between two
major versions, then remove these methods altogether in the next major
one.

I have absolutely no idea how or if this could be done (can phpDoc
code be used with the code? marking-up deprecated methods with a
normalized boolean variable? having the check be done on the Plugins
Repository, and having it send the boolean?), but I think it would be
a clean way to ensure a smooth transition for both users and
developers (and not only for load_plugin_textdomain(), but for all the
Plugins API methods).

What's more, if the fourth item from
http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.7 ("theme update api, like we do
for plugins") is indeed implemented, this could also prove very useful
for Themes API deprecated template tags and such.

Just a thought. Am I just plain wrong?

I think you might be putting too much trust in the coding knowledge
and willingness of people. Many, many, many people just use WordPress
as if it were magic. If a method is forcibly removed, and therefore
breaks thousands of instances of widgets, I can't begin to describe
you the pouring of help requests on the various local forums.
Plus, not all plugins developers read wp-hackers, and know that the
reason behind the breakage is a modification rather than a user's
specific setting. In this regard, a clear warning from within WP would
surely prevent a lot fists cursing from devs and users.
Don't break stuff, 'cos it's not the right way to prove that the
Plugins API is stable.

That's what I would recommend as well. Author templates are pretty flexible.

This has been discussed before, and rejected by a few, but I'd like to
beat this dead horse again... If a user of WordPress upgrades, and
then sees a message after upgrading that their plugin may be broken in
the future, they are highly likely at that time to go looking for an
update. Or, failing that, a replacement for that plugin.

In other words, we need to make the deprecated information *visible to
the end user*.

While it's true that plugin authors need to keep their software
up-to-date, what is even more true is that plugins that *don't* get
kept up to date need to be dumped in favor of the plugins that do. And
users are not going to dump older plugins if they don't know about
potential problems with them.

Which is a better UX? Having an upgrade break a bunch of plugins, or
having an upgrade tell the user "Hey, these plugins still work, but
they might not in a few more upgrades. Might be time to look for a fix
for them now instead of waiting until they break."

The only stick WordPress has to beat plugin authors with is the
end-user experience. If an author fails to stop using deprecated
functions, then their plugin could fail eventually... But the end-user
of that pluign has a different take on the topic, because the failure
will happen right at the time they upgrade WordPress, not the plugin.
So to them, it's WordPress's fault, not the plugin's or the
plugin-author's.

Show the deprecated info to the end-user and lots of problems will go away.

Oops, sorry, wasn't aware of that, joined only recently, intermittent
lurker before that.
I guess the important change between now and last time is that WP now
features a full-on plugin notification (and even update) process,
which could hopefully be piggy-backed on.

> But the end-user of that pluign has a different take on the topic, because the failure

Exactly. With the current path of deprecating "in the dark" (at least
to lambda users), the bucket stops at WordPress' developers, and we
can easily guess their thinking: "darn it, wordpress X.X breaks my
most useful plugin!", even though wp-devs spent 5 months warning
plugin-devs of the change.
With proper and timely warning, the bucket is passed onto either the
plugin author ("darn it, I must warn this lazy bum to update his
defective code before the next release") or the user himself ("darn
it, i should have been looking for a fix/alternative months ago").
Users would even KNOW which plugins might break with the next major
version, which is a feat in itself :)

I really hope this dead horse is not buried too deep ;-)

***

Expanding on this idea even further (hey, we can dream, right? :) )...
If this could be implemented on wp.org/ext/plugins, this could make
hand-made compatibility lists such as
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Plugin_Compatibility/2.6 completely
automatic. Same result for /themes (which is poised the central themes
repository, as is /pugins for plugins, yadda yadda...) and
http://codex.wordpress.org/Themes/Theme_Compatibility/2.6 .

Really, I think having such a functionality could only be a
win-win-win for wp-devs, plugin-devs and wp-users :)

Your table prefix should not be wp_. Click here to change it.

Change your database table prefix to mitigate zero-day SQL

I'm going to be installing WP Super Cache or Hyper Cache to keep my server

If I change wp_. to say ab_. will it affect the cache plugings and the

If the plugin is coded properly, it won't affect the operation at all. I 
have yet to actually use a plugin that doesn't function with a different 
prefix, so I would say the chances of having a problem are quite small.

I think this is a good idea, BUT...

We have to be careful with what message we give the user if we do  
this.  We can NOT say "this plugin still works for now", because it  
might not.  Deprecated functions are not the only thing that breaks  
old plugins.  At most we can say something like "This plugin uses  
outdated code, and should probably be updated or replaced."

This easily ties in to the issue of telling end users which plugins  
are not checked for updates.  (For which I submitted a patch, which  
has basically received no feedback.)

I think we need a narrow column in the plugins screen that can display  
icons, and the icons either have a mouseover "tiptext" and/or are  
clickabel to pop up a message window.  This could cover both this  
caution message, and the "not checked for updates" message (and  
whatever else comes up down the road.)

(Or maybe put said icons in the "version" cell?  Better than a whole  
new column....)

I'd put it in front of the plugin name.

However, given the separation of plugins in 2.6 and 2.7-bleeding, I'd
prefer to simply create a new section at the top of the page: "Plugins
that need attention."

Move plugins that need updates, plugins not checked, plugins found to
use deprecated functions, etc, all up there.

Granted I am new to wordpress plugins, would it be possible to create  
a mechanism ( using the same concept that updates the plugins ) to  
check them against a depreciated function list before updating  
wordpress to a new version?  Although disabling all of the plugins  
before updating and then having a list of plugins that will need  
attention essentially does the same thing, prechecking may be a better  
experience for the user.

Benedict is correct, but then again it's not a bad idea. It _could_ help
prevent a SQL injection.

FAR to intrusive.  There should be a notice, but they shouldn't  
radically alter the plugin organization.  These are relatively minor  
cautions, not major RED ALERTs.

Interesting idea, but probably a bit much.  What we could do, RE the  
idea above, is to have different levels of warning --

1) This plugin contains outdated (deprecated) code.
2) This plugin contains obsolete (called functions are gone!) code.

I was almost going to suggest auto-deactivation, but I don't think we  
should go that far, as the outdated code might be part of minor  
functionality and we shouldn't DEMAND that the user can't try to use  
the plugin.

What we're really doing is telling them where to look first if there's  
a problem.

I think that we are missing something very important here. The Codex is 
consistently outdated on what is or is not deprecated, and often is an 
unreliable source of accurate and current API information.

What mechanism could possibly keep track of the status of all function 
calls and valid parameters when the Codex doesn't even contain that data?

If we can fix this problem either programmatically or procedurally, then 
we can start talking about automated checks for deprecated code. Until 
such a time, I feel that such checks will be nothing more than a pipe dream.

Gaarai,

There is this problem called phpDocumentor. Luckily, Peter Westwood has 
blessed us with his public installation: http://sandbox.ftwr.co.uk/doc/ 
Hopefully, one of these days this will find itself on wordpress.org. 
Peter did suggest a better domain for it, so who knows (but Peter).

There is also the source, which has deprecated functions as marked, and 
wp-includes/deprecated.php, which holds obsolete functions and globals.

It should be pointed out that users already have the power to check 
whether or not plugins and themes use deprecated code with WordPress 
2.5+. All they have to do is add

define('WP_DEBUG', true);

to their wp-config.php file and they are done. If a plugin or theme uses 
deprecated functions, then an unfriendly message will appear telling the 
user that something is using a deprecated function. The usefulness of it 
ends there, but you could build a plugin, which goes down further and 
checks which file the deprecated function is being called in.

Also, a simple search through all of the plugin and theme files should 
also turn up where it is, if a plugin is not a viable solution.

Developers also have this same capability. It is hidden, but it exists 
well within WordPress. The best part is that it exists already and can 
be used now.

Hey Jacob. We met at WordCamp back in April. This is the Chris that 
chatted with you about wanting to develop some coding standards for plugins.

You bring up a good point, and it reinforces my point about the lack of 
consistency. First off, there is no way that the deprecated.php file can 
ever be a comprehensive source of what is or is not deprecated. 
Secondly, while the commenting has been improving greatly, I don't think 
any type of commenting format could ever adequately identify the nuances 
that occur with some types of deprecation.

Consider the ongoing debate about the API change with the 
load_plugin_textdomain() attributes. No amount of entries into the 
deprecated.php file or exhaustive commenting could distinguish between 
the old function call with two parameters and the envisioned replacement 
function call with two parameters.

I guess my point is that there may not be a solution to this problem. I 
would rather have a lack of such a "debugging" system than a system that 
only caught the obvious problems while missing the obscure ones entirely.

I suppose that there is a possible solution that isn't as elegant but 
could be implemented right now. Plugins that contain a readme.txt file 
and have an appropriately-formatted "Tested up to" entry could be 
checked for version compatibility. Thus, if a WordPress upgrade were 
available (which the code for that already exists), the plugins listing 
could show whether or not specific plugins are to be considered ready 
for the upgrade to the latest WordPress version. Just an idea to throw 
into the hat.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. Especially if its one step of

Please remember also that some of us support older versions of WP as  
well as the latest. With each successive version that means more  
version checks, branching, selectable includes..... some of which  
might trigger your red light and give the end user an erroneous warning.

I read on the codex:

option_value of siteurl to be set and disables the WordPress address
(URL) field in the Administration > Settings > General panel. 

That I interpreted that setting the variable in wp-config will force
this value to the database too. But it looks it doesn't do this. I'm
wrong?

You are correct: setting the WP_SITEURL or WP_HOME constant does not
change the siteurl or home option value in the database.

I tested it and i saw it wasn't updating DB but the codex says:

Setting this value in wp-config.php causes the wp_options table
option_value of siteurl to be set

Then I suppose codex need to be updated cause it says something wrong.

What does it matter what the value in the database is? You shouldn't be
manually querying, so it won't affect you.

(get_)bloginfo('url') and 'wpurl' will return the correct values.

I use this exact feature so I can use a copy of a live site's database on my
local test machine without editing the database. It works 100% perfectly
fine even though the values in the database are "wrong".

Indeed, but to me this is akin to a power-user tool, and as you say
yourself, displaying PHP notices remains quite unfriendly, and limited
in its usefulness.  For lambda users, that would mean help requests
like "I added WP-DEBUG, but it broke WordPress/my favorite plugin even
further."

So the best way would be to force plugin-devs to manually fill the
"Requires WordPress Version: X.X or higher" and "Compatible up to:
X.X" fields on  wp.org/extend/plugins? And maybe add a backend check
to make sure it really fits in this versions, and if not send a
warning to the plugin-dev to proofread his code and revalidate his
stated supported versions?
That would therefore require a backend compatibility table for each
and every plugin (and theme!) API functions.
>From there on, the notitication process launched by WP could check not
only against each plugin's version, but also against WordPress version
itself. Users thus know if the widget can work with their version even
before they click the Enable button :)
I have no idea what would be the code implication of such a feature on
Extend, I'm just thinking out loud, sorry if it's too loud :).

WordPress' phpDocumentation is getting really precise thanks to
Jacob's work, and deprecated functions do feature the @deprecated tag,
with even a pointer to the replacing method. It would be even better
if that tag included a "since version X.X", but by combining this
information with the @since tag, a pretty solid compatibility table
could already be extracted automatically from each /branched versions
in SVN, and a table generated with each major version clearly
indicated. Add to that a check that raises a flag if a new version
doesn't support a function that the previous one did, and you got the
@removed-like information filled-up. No need to rely on the
possibly-outdated Codex.
(yes, I know, @removed doesn't exist for obvious reason :) )


Also, I agree with what Stephen Rider wrote.

My point was that you could make it look prettier or someone else. Just 
because the default is to throw a notice to the viewer doesn't mean that 
it could save the location of the problem and then output where the user 
can see it in a nicer format. No one has yet made a debug plugin, and I 
suppose I'm just waiting for someone else to make one, so that I don't 
have to. However, I wanted to do it a little bit differently, and the 
ticket that would allow me to do that hasn't been finished nor committed.

I think it would be great to have a front end with the plugins/themes 
extend where a trusted member can confirm the tested up to. That would 
be wicked sweet. I'm unsure how it would work.

I should explain that. I had wanted to put when the function was 
deprecated, but that information wasn't readily available at the time. 
Also, it was agreed way back in like Fall of last year or something that 
it should just point to the function that replaces it. Not the best way, 
but was accepted way. It would be better if the @deprecated since X.X.X 
with @see function_name() instead. Might not make sense seeing it in the 
phpDocumentor site.

You could check the replacement function @since information to see when 
the function came to. This might not mean the same as when it was 
deprecated, but it should get you close.

Would be usefull for end users that mess up with paths and url in the
admin panel, this solve the problem but if it force tha value would be
an easy alternative that editing DB using phpmyadmin.

I'm using this features for long time too for my llocals site ahta are
copy of online ones. My question is about the correctness of codex and
for really basic not geek users (this problem happens 3 4 times a
month on italian forum :) )

I disagree. If I need to temporarily change the path of my install, I can do
it via the config file. Plus what about the people doing crazy installs like
dynamic install URLs?

If you want the database different, then change the database.

If the Codex is incorrect, then fix it. It is a user-written wiki afterall.
It's written by people just like you and therefore it's not guaranteed to be
correct and it's up to people like you to fix it. :)

Your making it sound as if it would be a good plugin project, and
indeed it would, but I think the usefulness of the whole thing would
be if all these data was centered on Extend, and information was
transmitted using the Notification process, which implies a change in
Core code, among other things.

Indeed, it implies a lot of work, if it were to follow my ideal view:
# First step:
  - parse @deprecated and @since tag from each /branches versions into
a wp.org-hosted database, along with "not available in this version"
flag (so that we can get a begin and end date between that and @since,
and mark the whole method as deprecated in the generated table). Bonus
points if the parser can compare each function's @param and @return
changes between major version, in order to mark WP version with "major
change for this method" flag.
  - modify WP's Notification process in order to display deprecation
notes and unavailability notices if plugin is at latest version, new
version notification if it is not yet.
# Second step
  - modify Extends backend to double-check plugins version
requirements, and notice/mail author about a need for verification.

Clearly, this is not something that can be undertaken by a single
developer, and it would be of a lot of help to just about any WP user,
it would most certainly relieve a lot of stress from the forums, and
it would make Compatibility tables that much more up-to-date.
I feel therefore that this task, ask huge as it is (on the Extend side
at least) has to be done by the Automattic folks, and therefore I'd
like to hear the opinions of Matt, Ryan and the others of the
feasibility of this. Too bad GSoC is done.

The bad thing is that, even by cutting it into two steps, this might
not be doable for 2.7, and therefore the decision to
replace/remove/deprecate load_plugin_textdomain() still remains.

Again, I really don't know if I'm just aiming too high and asking for
the impossible, so let me know if I do.
I do feel, tho, that this could be important and very useful to
everyone, so pardon me for insisting on certain ideas.

Looks like you not undernstand me! Maybe cause english is not my
mother tongue, if I was sure that the statement in the codex is wrong
iI already chamnged it (even if i rarely edit wiki in nott my mother
tongue languages). For these reason i asked here to know if the codezx
it's wrong or it's a bug... understand now?

The code itself keeps track of that and has since 2.4.

wp-includes/functions.php. _deprecated_function and _deprecated_file
are called whenever somebody uses a deprecated function or file.

This is why/how I want this info displayed to the end-user. Don't much
care about HOW it is displayed, but the end-user is the only one who
can actually do anything about it. We can't make plugin authors fix
their plugins, but the plugin-users can complain to those authors or
they can switch to different plugins. Natural selection and all that.

I've been telling people to add code to their theme's functions.php
file instead of manually modifying the DB:
update_option('siteurl','http://example.com');
update_option('home','http://example.com');

Stick that in there, load the page a couple times, remove it again.
Database fixed.

This is an important distinction. For the record, I just updated the
wiki to reflect the fact that these settings don't update the db (just
override it).

Or you can just use the RELOCATE define.

Add define('RELOCATE',true); to wp-config.php and go to wp-login.php and 
it will update siteurl for you automatically to the url you access it with.

Indeed and the handy functions we added to allow for a WP_DEBUG enabled 
install to highlight them.

I guess we need to work into the plugin activation sandbox a deprecated 
function detector using the code we already have.

something for the task list I guess!

Then there is a metod to force the DB usign the variable above and
setting relocate... nice to know... codex need to be updated again...
someone that write a decent english please do, I'm not sure i would
write something understandable by myself :)

PS How many define can be set in wp-config? Less then 1000? (jocking)

I tried that for the first time yesterday.  The problem is that  
***without any plugins***, WP_DEBUG _still_ throws out two dozen  
messages when I pull up a page.  So the "deprecated" notices are  
buried in a lot of baggage.

That needs to change for WP_DEDBUG to be really useful

Depending on plugin authors to fill in the max compatibility info is  
circular reasoning.  If they're not checking it out and getting rid of  
obsolete function calls, they sure as heck aren't going to fill in the  
compatibility info either.  "When it breaks, it needs updating."

About the only way I can think of that this could be automated is if,  
upon update, WordPress read the source files of plugins and looked  
(via grep) for function calls, and then compared what it found to a  
list of deprecated functions.

Kind of brute force, but the _deprecated_function and _deprecated_file  
functions can only find the functions when they're called.

Okay, second idea:

Maybe a debug system could hook into _deprecated_function etc. and  
simply record hits.  (I think there is a do_action within each of  
those, so it could be done that way with a plugin right now.)

The limitation is that it would only find them as they are called, and  
thus couldn't possibly flag bad plugins preemptively.  To find the  
outdated code without running it, you need to read the files....

Is there a hook for when WordPress notices that it's been updated?   
(Not just when database needs to change, but when THIS run is a higher  
version of WP than the PREVIOUS run?)

Hopefully there's still some interest in this. I have a patch up,
would be great if a few people could test it out.

Found a bad side effect -- it's nearly doubling my queries on those Pages.

Query dump: http://asdfsa345.pastebin.com/m4c8095f3

Seems get_page_by_path() is being called a couple dozen times. Why I have no
clue...

For example: SELECT ID, post_name, post_parent FROM wp_posts WHERE ID = 46
and post_type='page'


Some example URL structures incase it helps:

http://site.com/mypage/8/
http://site.com/mypage/8/1/
http://site.com/mypage/8/8/
http://site.com/mypage/1/8/
http://site.com/mypage/5/
http://site.com/mypage/5/8/
http://site.com/mypage/5/6/
etc.

Any ideas what's wrong and what I can do to cut it down? It's the end of the
world as I Super Cache, but I'd still like to figure out what's going on
behind the scenes. :)

Here's a better dump from the very, very top of my theme and all but the
rewrite plugin disabled: http://asdfsa345.pastebin.com/m4992e593

That's 38 queries done by the WordPress core pre-theme. Ouch.

Or is it just that my ISP's nameservers are acting up again? As far as I 
can tell all Cnames are affected (www,mu,codex,forum). I usually try 
Google's translation to bypass the nameservers, but it looks like the 
pages are being fetched from G's cache... wordpress.com works fine, btw.

New plugin that I trust will be useful to plugin and theme authors:

Log Deprecated Calls
http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/features/wp-log-deprecated-calls/

Kind of like what WP_DEBUG does, but the message is more informative.   
It should tell you precisely what file and line called the deprecated  
function/file, which means you can go straight to it and update it.

Enjoy. :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Search system improvements
Message-ID: <48900B0B.6090204@gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

I would like to share with you with a piece of code. Maybe someone would 
like to test it or look at the code. I will appreciate any word of advice.

So basically, what would I like to show? It's a patch for WordPress 
(tested with trunk svn version from two days ago or so) that add support 
for new search framework. This framework allows to manage different 
search engines. It is integrated in query.php file. So when, searching 
is performed, search framework picks appropriate search engine and do 
searching.

Search plugins can be packaged as WordPress plugins. I've created new 
search engine for wordpress. It allows searching within pages, posts, 
attachments and comments. I hope it will work nice.

I am creating also engine based on Google Search API. It's not really 
tested so it may not work properly.

Here are links where you can download all files:
[1] Patch for search framework
http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/search-egnine-trunk.patch
[2] New search engine
http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/default-search-engine.tgz
[3] Google search engine
http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/google-search-engine.tgz
[4] Sample search results template
http://inzynieriawiedzy.org/kodie/search-template.php.txt

I've attached template because it is quite not compatible with standard 
templates for now. However, I will try to fix it somehow.

So how to change search engine? Simply by adding field called 
'search_engine'. Possible values are 'default' and 'google'.

You can also change template which will be used to display search 
results. To do it just use field called 'wp_template' and enter there 
template file name.

I am currently working on Zend_Lucene search engine. However, it is in 
very alpha version.

Thanks,
Kodie

P.S. Eric Marder, have you received my replies for your mails?

Great.
now we just need to get plugin authors to use this.
actually, even users.

This is very cool, and a great plus for plugin devs! :) I'm impressed
with the short time it took you to build it.
I'm afraid it's still too techie for casual users, tho. I mean,
browsing through a log file (first you have to know what that means)
is already a biggie, and you are still left with yourself once you
know that such function is to be replaced by such other one. There
needs to be something within WP to warn users about potential failures
of plugins/themes, in the same vein as the Notification system (yup,
still beating that horse myself :) ).

The best way is probably to send them an email and ask them.  That is,  
scan your own setup and see which plugins get flagged, then email the  
author.

I've recently become adept at code spelunking to see what can be  
hooked.  Usually when you've found a hook, doing somethig with it  
isn't terribly hard. :)

And yes, definitely devs only.

Well, this could be modified a bit.  I'll see what I can come up  
with. ;-)

Message-ID: <fd3b80510807300614i36091085tbc8508cb7c43e2b2@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone know if there's a reasonably straightforward SQL query I
can run to calculate the number of users who can publish posts?
Because of the way roles now work (and can be changed by plugins),
it's not as simple as just checking how many entries in wp_usermeta
there are with a value for wp_user_level greater than 1.

get_page_by_path makes a call to get all the pages matching a post
name. In the case of http://asdfsa345.pastebin.com/m4c8095f3, that is
query number 9:
SELECT ID, post_name, post_parent FROM wp_posts WHERE post_name = '8'
AND (post_type = 'page' OR post_type = 'attachment')

It then loops through all the found page parents to build the page
path, one at a time. Then it tries to match that path with the actual
path it's looking for. When it finds a match, it stops and gets that
page.

You're getting all these queries because you have, by my quick count,
at least seven pages with a post_name of "8", before it finds the one
it's looking for.

Whenever I think it I can hear people telling me 'well why don't you
write it', but it would be great to have some standard functions to
deal with users in bulk. Really the whole user system could be a lot
clearer (get_userdata + get_currentuserinfo are pretty confusing), but
just having a get_users() function to match get_posts and get_terms
would be a great boon. (as it is my plugins need to run their own user
fetching code :S)

Right now the wp_dropdown_users() function actually does direct SQL
calls to get the users, which is pretty whack IMHO. It also doesn't
offer any capability filtering, which would be great to see in my
dream get_users() function.

Cap checking off the top of my head: if an argument for a capability
is passed, like '&has_cap=publish', it would get the list of roles
(global $wp_roles, $wp_roles->roles), iterate through them checking
for ones that have the desired _capability_, then check wp_usermeta
for people who have either the capability itself or a role that
encompases it. Not sure if that would make an incredibly slow query,
thought it seems like it might especially if you have lots of roles
and are looking for a capability they all have.

Benedict: The above should probably work and the sql wouldn't be that
crazy, you just have to do the role/cap filtering yourself in php.

Yeah, that's what I figured.

This same issue though could easily be reproduced though without any plugins
(say by having a bunch of Pages with stubs that are all "foobar"). Perhaps
it's worth grabbing all parents of the post_name query at once and then
looping through those results rather than querying for each parent one by
one?

Hang on, there's a function to do this sort of thing already.
get_post_ancestors. Why isn't it using that? Just do a get_post on the
page, then a get_post_ancestors on it..

Even if that doesn't make sense for some reason, if this function was
adding the results of those lookups to the cache, then it wouldn't
have to lookup any given parent more than once. You've got half a
dozen queries each for the parent of pages 4 and 3 in there.
