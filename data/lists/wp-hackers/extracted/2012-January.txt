How do you remove the style admin-bar-css from being added at wp_head() ?

This is not working:

add_action( 'wp_print_styles', 'my_remove_admin_bar_css', 100 );

function my_remove_admin_bar_css(){
     wp_deregister_style( 'admin-bar-css' );
}

Or is this featured required for all front-end development?

And this one, that doesn't seem to have an id:

<styletype="text/css" media="screen"> html { margin-top: 28px 
!important; } * html body { margin-top: 28px !important; } </style>

What are you trying to do exactly? Disable the admin bar on the front
end, or simply add your own styling for it?

This is what did the trick:

add_filter( ||'show_admin_bar'||, ||'__return_false'| |)|

This should be the responsibility of each theme to add the admin bar, 
every theme should have new ways to implement these same features in 
different and progressive ways.

See, thats why I was asking.. If you wanted to simply forcably hide
the admin bar on the front end, then it'd have been stupid for me to
dig out the way to remove the styling...

It shouldn't a problem of digging out how to remove the styling. It 
shouldn't be there to begin with! Starting at zero, a blank canvas, is 
important.

The right place would be plugins at wordpress.org

Also the list strips attachments. It prefers the Full Monty.

But yes, that's caused by list-plugin-authors, and it looks like there's a

"Callback to display updates to the plugin in the row following the plugin's row in the plugin admin."

function afterPluginRow( $pluginFile 

Send it to plugins and they'll handle it. Happy New Year :)

I'm pretty sure you can do this with a normal posts query:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters

'orderby'=>'title'

Adding that to any query should make the posts come in alphabetical order
based on the title.

Message-ID: <CAHBjUcQzzkJg=DSXBVKoE4ALZauDjDvL+sbG=aj4YcMa98mOnw@mail.gmail.com>

I am currently searching for documentation about the Plupload script
that was integrated into the WP core with the 3.3 release.

My needs are the following:

- force a size limit of 1024px width / height for picture uploads.
- if the picture is bigger, ask the browser for client-side downsizing.
- if the browser can't do it, refuse the upload and provide a
meaningful error message.

I was wondering if WP 3.3 would provide a config panel for such
settings, a bit like the (now obsoleted) WPlupload plugin did:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wplupload/screenshots/

Or can we define such things in functions.php ? Is there any
"official" documentation about how Plupload works in WP? Any examples
or "best practices"?

Many questions. For some reason, Google didn't bring up any up-to-date
information.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Message-ID: <4F023F0C.2020005@braydon.com>

Plupload has a resize parameter that can resize images on the 
client-side, if possible. I haven't seen anything about it blocking images.

Here is the parameter from their docs ( 
http://www.plupload.com/documentation.php ):

var uploader = new plupload.Uploader({
         (...)
	resize : {width : 320, height : 240, quality : 90},
	(...)
});

On the WordPress side, there is a filter "plupload_init" to modify default settings. On line 1331 of /wp-admin/includes/media.php resize isn't currently being used.

Adding this into functions.php should probably do the trick (untested):

add_filter( 'plupload_init', 'my_plupload_init', 0, 1 );

function my_plupload_init( $plupload_init ) {
	$plupload_init['resize'] = array('width' =>  1024, 'height' =>  1024);
         return $plupload_init;
}

I'm glad he did post it - I've seen a lot of adds, deletes, changes, file 
permission changes in a directory called wp-content/cache/hookd/ many followed 
by my domain name, but not all of them.  

I'm not a programmer, so I've been trying to figure out what is going on, and 
if I should be concerned, and what steps if any I should be taking. My 
WordPress and all my plugins are current. I have a hit counter "WordPress Hit 
Counter" v2.6 on my site.

I haven't noticed any malicious activity on the customer facing part of my 
website.

Any advice on what I should be doing?

Anyway we can hook into the themes per page in the admin to change the
default of 24 per page?

I know of themes_api_args and themes_api filters.

Any hints?

There is a filter "edit_posts_per_page" to change that.

In functions.php adding something like this will set a new default, and 
still have the user option available.

function my_edit_post_per_page() {
     $per_page = (int) get_user_option( 'edit_post_per_page' );
     if ( empty( $per_page ) ) {
         $per_page = 100;
     }
     return $per_page;
}

add_filter( 'edit_posts_per_page', 'my_edit_post_per_page' );

That will work for themes per page?

Cause no option is available like in plugins,posts,etc from the drop down
contextual.

24 is hard coded into the list tables.
I can see it'd be possible to half the render of the tables, set new
pagination, and render again.. but it looks like that'll be rather
hacky.. and I'm not about to attempt to code that up :)

See http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19469 for adding some kind
of options for it.
There have been discussions about that table, and it may change
slightly in a future release.. so unless it's a "I MUST do this" I'd
just leave it at 24..

My mistake, I read this as posts per page from a theme. The default for 
posts per page in the admin has always seemed a bit low. Hopefully it's 
helpful anyways.

Hi Daniel,

I don't know how they implemented it, but you could use the GD-Lib or Graphicsmagick to generate dynamic images on your own:

http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php
http://www.graphicsmagick.org/

You "only" have to fetch the feed and generate the image periodically.

Regards,
Klaus

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multi-Site WWW prefix question
Message-ID: <4F047629.6070509@gmail.com>

In the process of setting up multi-site on an established/already setup 
website.

In the process, you get the following message:

We recommend you change your siteurl to
example.com before enabling the network feature. It will still be
possible to visit your site using the www prefix with an
address like www.example.com but any links will not have the
www prefix.

Why is this recommendation made?

I can't follow it, for various client brand reasons the site has to stay 
on www. rather than without www. (don't ask).

Is there anything I need to look out for if I ignore this advice?

Thanks,
Robert

Just make sure BOTH site and home URL have the www, and you should be okay.

Mostly I've seen a problem crop up as endless redirects to the network admin pages. I want to say that it does odd things with subdomains too, but I can't recall what.

We are launching a multisite service this year - using www, subdomain and

without any issues. Not that that proves much.....

If it's gonna break, it'll do it when you upgrade.

Magically you will no longer be able to hit domain.com/wp-admin/network 
and the error will have to do with too many redirects.

The catch is that for SOME people it works forever and ever. Others it 
dies all the time. I have no idea why, never been able to repro it, and 
it's just a big, weird 'Buh?' moment :(

Hello,

Thank-you for your helpful answer. What I'm looking at doing is
getting a plugin from mybb (Sorry guys but mybb got something that is
helpful for this) and rewriting most of the code to make it do what I
want to do.

The plugin: Userbar (http://community.mybb.com/thread-66422.html)
The guide that I am using part of:
http://digwp.com/2009/11/import-and-display-feeds-in-wordpress/

If anyone can think of a better way, please let me know.

That's useful information, thank you. I'll make sure we test the 3.2.1 ->
3.3(.1) upgrade thoroughly :)

Please note that this is off-topic for this list, as this is for
discussion of core development.

If you'd like to discuss doing something like this, contact the
SimplePie support list[0] for the fetch_feed stuff or something more
general like Stack Overflow[1] or the WordPress Stack Exchange[2]. The
WordPress.org forums might also be able to help you out.

(Alternatively, instead of emailing the SimplePie support list, you can
email me directly, since that will achieve the same thing really.)

Message-ID: <CAP2YDhE8UqcGQFvuMu+6d-XzK6CRkRehBOSigyw=fHbT+K_Zng@mail.gmail.com>

I recently made a release to a plugin in WP.Org. The newer version has a
different database structure than the previous one. Some critical functions
depend on it. The table is altered after creating them in the activation
hook. However, after an upgrade many of my users are reporting not being
able to use some functions because of the databse structure issue.

Not sure if this is a bug or I'm missing something. What needs to be done
to ensure that some code is always run in initial activation or upgradation?

You're better off running an upgrade routine on the admin_init hook.

Hi,

is there a browsable archive of this list online?

I really would appreciate having something better than the primitive
mailman archive I found here

http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/


If it is not - how can we vote for this?

Thanks!

Message-ID: <77A5E232-5C2A-4ACF-BADC-C410DA389E3A@hearingvoices.com>


in working on a Codex Docs page about Slugs,
been doing some tests and core reading that seem to reveal what might be a bug -- 
wanted to run it by y'all first to see if it's something i should i trac-ticket
or if it's all intentional...

1. made a Page w/ slug: 'slugname'; then a child Page with same slug: 'slugname'.
/slugname/slugname/ serves the child Page.

2. registered a heirarchical CPT w/ rewrite['slug'] of:  'slugname'.
/slugname/ serves above parent Page (query: pagename=slugs), but
/slugname/slugname/ looks for a (non-existant) CPT page,
then serves 404.php (query: slugs=slugs&post_type=slugs&name=slugs)

thing is, tho /slugname/slugname/ generates a 404,
it IS a valid Page permalink. at least that's what WP tells the user --
in the permalink box of the Edit Page screen (via get_sample_permalink()?).
however, if user clicks the View Page button, they get that CPT page 404.

this is likely due to the heirarchy of rewrite rules in which CPT rewrite slugs
get processed before Page slug matches.

3. now let's set the category_base to (you guessed it): 'slugname".
/slugname/slugname/ looks for a (non-existant) category,
then serves 404.php (query: category_name=slugs).

meanwhile WP's permalink box is telling the user, in two cases, that URL is valid:
/slugname/slugname/ the child Page AND
/slugname/slugname/ the CPT page.
however, if the user clicks the Edit screen's View button in either, they'd get the category 404.

again, likely due to rewrite rules (giving precedence to category_base over CPT rewrite slug).

meanwhile, wp_unique_post_slug() is busy checking for slugs w/ the same post_parent.
top-level Pages and top-level heirarchical CPT pages do have the same: post_parent = 0.
so if there were a top-level Page slug: 'slugname',
and you tried to assign top-level CPT page a slug of: 'slugname',
you'd get instead 'slugname-2' (b/c both have:  post_parent = 0).

however those don't collide:
top-level Page: /slugname/
top-level heirarchical CPT page: /cpt-slug/slugname/

the collision comes when the CPT has the same rewrite slug as a top-level Page slug.
and further still when that same string is the category-base (or tag_base or post_format_rewrite_base).

seems like wp_unique_post_slug() should be checking not only page slugs
but also against some reserved terms ('category', 'tag', 'type')
along with any assigned rewrite bases, and registered CPT rewrite slugs.

and if post_type is hierarchical and post_parent = 0, perhaps it should allow
the same slug for different post types w/ different rewrite slugs (since there's no collision). 

hope i've explained this ok. and not even sure what happens when you do things like
assign 'tag' as category base or 'type' as tag base (both are allowed in Settings).
or if permalink structure /%category%/%postname%/ when both cat and post slugs
match rewrite bases or CPT rewrite slugs.

bottom line, tho, the prob may not be in the above rewrite logic,
as much as that WP tells the user permalink info that isn't correct.

maybe wp_unique_post_slug(), get_sample_permalink(), and rewite rules should talk to each other.
and maybe register_post_type() also needs to check rewrite bases (and top-level Page slugs?).
and setting rewrite bases should also check against CPT rewrite slugs. 
(and then, maybe also, it'd help telling user why they got a "-2" added to their slug/rewrite base.)

or maybe all above is fine as is, w/ good reasoning behind each process.
thanks for any insight,
bg

It's not a bug, you're just creating conflicts and expecting some kind
of magic to happen that simply isn't in there.

Don't create conflicting naming systems. If you use a slug for a
custom post type, you can't use it for a page on the same level, as it
will hide that page and all its children. Ditto for categories, tags,
or any other rewrite rule that outranks pages.

The base slug, when it's defined for a taxonomy or post type, takes
over that whole URL tree. No Pages can be in that tree any more. Or
rather, they can't be accessed any more. This isn't a bug, it simply
doesn't support that.

I would say that this is undesirable, since somebody might be relying
on this behavior. If one had a big tree of Pages that they wanted to
migrate into CPTs but keep the same URL structure, for example. It
also doesn't address somebody creating a CPT with a slug after
creating the same slugged Page.

IMO, best way is simply to say that is not supported or undefined, and
let people use it as they see fit.

I'm going to have to agree with Barrett that WordPress should be solid
enough to protect against the UI allowing such poor end-user practices where
a permalink structure can be stepped on.  One needs to remember, >95% of the
users have no technical concept about what they are doing when creating
categories or updating slugs... and how they may break things.  In a site
with multiple bloggers, one user may not be aware of what another user has
done, so it may not be bad practice on their part at all.  This said, the
likelihood of this occurring is probably not too great but still worth
correcting.

I have a site where I set the Category base to tag before tags existed
in WordPress, when tags were added to WP they didn't work, threw up a
404. Had to set the Tag base to tags so I could use tags as well.
Tested on localhost and it's the same now.

I have to agree with OZ, WordPress can't account for every possible
poorly thought out structure a user might come up with like my example
above. If WordPress starts limiting what can and can't be used it will
limit WordPress.

I had an issue with a static page and a category with the same slug
(at least I think that was the issue)-

Following setup

Permalinks
Custom Structure = /%postname%.html
Category base = - (a hyphen)
Tag base = default setting

Standard .htaccess rules

Have a Category "Funny Jokes" - domain.com/-/funny-jokes/

Created a static page I'd been using as the front page "Funny Jokes"
so it loaded at domain.com/ with no issues.

Changed to archived front page and the static page loaded at
domain.com/funny-jokes redirects to domain.com/funny-jokes/ and is
blank.

I'm assuming the issue is related to the category since other static
pages load fine. Also the static page has comments and loading
domain.com/funny-jokes/comment-page-1#comment-12345 loads the page as
expected.

Thought it might be a bug, but couldn't replicate on localhost so
changed the slug of the static page from funny-jokes to
really-funny-jokes and it works, problem solved even though I didn't
figure out the exact cause.

Sorry, I think you misunderstand the word 'hacker.'

Hackers don't find out email addresses or break into systems. We make them.

Check out the definition <http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html> for
more info. (In case you're curious the word you're searching for is *cracker
*.)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Bug or Expected behaviour? Taxonomy/Term parameters
Message-ID: <4F07186F.2050905@gmail.com>

If performing a custom WP_Query in 3.3.1, and selecting posts in a custom taxonomy by term ID - it returns posts assigned to the ID *AND* posts assigned to any child terms of this ID.

Surely if selecting by term ID it should return only posts assigned to that term, not children also.

If this is a feature rather than a bug - how do you select posts only assigned to the parent term, and not children?

<?php

$args = array(
	'tax_query' =>  array(
		array(
			'taxonomy' =>  'example',
			'field' =>  'id',
			'terms' =>  '5'
		)
	)
);
$query = new WP_Query( $args );

?>

$query will contain posts assigned to taxonomy ID5, AND posts assigned to any children terms of this ID.

Thanks,
Robert

1. just wanted to tell you, it was your recent post and patch
that inspired me to start these slug tests and a Codex Docs page on slugs.

> It's not a bug, you're just creating conflicts

2.  not saying the rewrite rules have a bug, or the slug-naming process.

but when WP tells the user: here's your valid Permalink for your Page.
and that URL is, instead, a 404, that perhaps is a bug.

(ie, the misleading info WP gives the user in the Edit Page screen)

Add 'include_children'=>false to your tax query array if you don't
want the children.

Nothing wrong with that, but that is not a bug nevertheless. It's
simply not supported

See, "bug" implies something that is broken. A behavior that is
supposed to be supported, but which isn't working. This particular
thing isn't unintended behavior, it's just potentially unexpected
behavior.

What you're actually requesting here is the addition of a new
"feature". You want it to support something that it currently does not
support. You want it to check for slugs across the whole spectrum
instead of just in the Pages, so that users cannot possibly create a
conflicting set of permalinks.

I have no particular objection to that, but it is a new feature and
would need to be treated and debated as such first, because there's
cases where this new feature may be undesirable which you might have
not considered. I think it would be rather confusing for a user to try
to create a page named "tag" or "category" only for it to come up as
"tag-2" or "category-2" because of the conflict with those
pre-existing taxonomies. Sure, the Page's link would then work, but
the user wouldn't understand why his URL wasn't being allowed.

New features need consideration and debate. Bugs, usually, don't.

I agree, that would be confusing.  

One option might be as simple as displaying a message in the admin after the user creates a tag or category (or whatever) that has a known URL conflict. That way if the user knew what they are doing they could ignore the message but if they didn't at least they would not have to be frustrated by having to try to later figure out why it wasn't working.

FWIW.

"We agreed that 3.4?s ?theme? would be, ?Making it easier to make your site look how you want it to look.? Shorthand: Appearance/switching themes."

Can I simply ask - why?

Where I, personally, come from is the view of a developer building custom themes for clients. I believe that once I deliver a theme to a client the last thing I want is for them to be able to start adding new themes.
Kind of defeats my purpose.

Now, if I look at it from a non-developer POV I can still see issues with switching themes every 5 mins - layouts change to drastically/ the viewer gets confused/ bad for UX, UI etc

Obviously I am just a very small cog in a huge mega engine, but i'm struggling to see the end goal of this decision.
Should I just shut up and wait my turn?

Others can chime in with their thoughts, but IMO:

put simply, It won't affect you, or your clients.

The changes will be aimed at streamlining/enhancing the theme preview
and switching process - If your clients have no other themes
installed, then it won't affect them.

But you're right as to the target audience, bloggers who manage their
own site, who don't write custom themes, who switch between themes
oftenish (or at least, like trying a new theme occasionally to see how
it looks).

The target audience needn't even be bloggers who switch themes often. It
may be a new user who has just installed WordPress for the first time and
has downloaded ten different themes to try out.

I believe the changes also aim to cover theme features, such as menus,
widgets, custom headers, etc. Lots of stuff that users may change more
regularly than they change their actual active theme.

Correct. The intent doesn't really have anything to do with how often 
you change things, just that customizing your site should be as painless 
as possible, whether that's switching themes or previewing widgets 
before they go live.

To be blunt, who cares what you as a vendor want? The person who owns 
and manages the site is the person our features are designed for. If you 
don't want them to be able to do things on their own or go with a new 
theme later on, why not go with a bespoke system or at least something 
that's hard to use or locked down with permissions? The whole point of 
WordPress is freedom and ease. If you want to prevent your clients from 
taking part in that, it's kind of lame.

Freedom is peculiar word. Any time there is an graphical user interface 
for customization of a theme, you loose one freedom and gain another. A 
non-technically proficient person gains ability to make minor changes to 
the theme under a system of rules, yet those features make a program 
more complicated and often times not as easy to work with for beginners 
and veterans, and less easy to maintain. Is the definition of easy and 
freedom of use limited to the GUI? Can it be extended to include ease 
and freedom of the way in which themes are written? Such as an upgrade 
to the template tags, so that they are less rigid and more flexible and 
abstract.... and not depending on a global state of $post.

To be blunt, that comes across as opinionated. One should care about the
vendor too. Feels like I'm stepping into an old argument here?

Lee, adding new themes in itself is not something you'll ultimately be able
to stop anyone from doing. There are plenty of WordPress hosts and themes
out there for your clients to go to. It seems to me that you know this and
that there is some inherent issue with theme switching that has given you
bad experience in the past? Is this not the very opportunity to explore
improving it?

Depending on the project/ client i sometimes remove the ability to change themes, but, the original question was really to find out if there is something i'm missing or not quite understanding.

I care a lot about the vendor, i care a lot about WordPress.

Just asking questions, that's all.

And, yes, who hasn't had a client ring up in a panic because they've changed themes 'just to see what happens'?

Never had anyone ask to change themes, they want to build them, not 
switch them.

"To be blunt" - the vendors have played a key part in making WordPress
what it is today. 

As per Tom - feel like we're stepping into an old argument here?

Freedom is for everyone - the end users, our clients, and development
companies/vendors included. Otherwise - "it's kind of lame".

Correct. The intent doesn't really have anything to do with how often
you change things, just that customizing your site should be as painless
as possible, whether that's switching themes or previewing widgets
before they go live.

To be blunt, who cares what you as a vendor want? The person who owns
and manages the site is the person our features are designed for. If you
don't want them to be able to do things on their own or go with a new
theme later on, why not go with a bespoke system or at least something
that's hard to use or locked down with permissions? The whole point of
WordPress is freedom and ease. If you want to prevent your clients from
taking part in that, it's kind of lame.

Message-ID: <25E20A4F-8875-4882-8520-F9CD75FF7816@hearingvoices.com>

dear hackers,
in writing a Codex Docs page on Naming Slugs.
i hope it's ok to consult this list on code-related questions.
(and thanks Otto for that feature/bug clarification)

i'm trying to clearly, concisely, & accurately explain when slugs get a "-2",
aka, the return value of wp_unique_post_slug(). 

Q1. that function has this comment:
 "// Page slugs must be unique within their own trees."

not sure if that's correct way to say it? i think the function checks
for identical post_name AND post_parent IN (any) hierarchical post_type
-- so it doesn't distinguish btwn trees.

here's some non-unique slugs in the same Page tree that DON'T get a "-2":
/pagename/pagename/pagename/

while top-level page slugs in different trees DO  get a "-2" (both: post_parent=0):
/pagename/ (Page)
/cpt-slug/pagename-2/  (CPT page)

so, am i correct in saying?:
All top-level parent page slugs (Pages and CPTs) must be unique.
All Page slugs (and hierarchical CPT page slugs) with the same parent page must be unique.

(i'll phase it better later for avg user, for now just want to know if i have it right).

Q2. comment reads:
"// Attachment slugs must be unique across all types."

this seems right, the SQL checks for thru all post_name(s), regardless of post_type.
so, am i correct in saying?:

Attachment slugs must be unique among all post types (including nav_menu).

Yeah, that statement is confusing. You can have the same slug at
multiple places in a given tree, just not as siblings on the same
branch.

Actually, this particular special case might be considered to be a
bug. Don't know whether this is intentional or not. I'm guessing not.

I'd say that perhaps you're overcomplicating it. The purpose of the
numbered suffix is to ensure that you can't create pages with
conflicting permalinks. So you can't create two "/page/about" pages,
one of them will become "about-2". But "/page/about" and
"/otherpage/about" would be fine.

So ideally, the numbered suffix would appear only when there would be
a conflict.

With CPTs thrown in, I'm thinking that wp_unique_post_slug shouldn't
be checking across all post types but only for the post-type in
question. This assumes that all hierarchical CPTs defined will have a
prefix to their permalink.

It might be worth rewriting that $check_sql line to this:

$check_sql = "SELECT post_name FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_name = %s
AND post_type = $post_type AND ID != %d AND post_parent = %d LIMIT 1";

And seeing if that causes any issues. That would eliminate the
/cpt-slug/pagename-2 problem.

Might be simpler to just say that "Attachment slugs must be unique
slugs, period." Although this isn't strictly speaking correct, since
it's possible to create an attachment with a slug before creating a
page with the same slug and have it working.

Realistically, I can't think of any actual reason that attachments
should have this requirement. I might be missing something though.

+1 

We have recently run into a major headache because of this and had to add an ugly hack to get around it.  Been meaning to post a trac ticket about it, but if anyone else wants to before me than please do.

The latest version of WordPress that preserve widgets when switching themes
goes a long way to eliminating problems when a client experiments with a
new theme. More improvements in this area can only be a good thing.

I am rather shocked at your attitude here Jane. Is this position held by the rest of the core team?

I would much rather see that the core team cares about the whole ecosystem, from end users to the developers who make themes for them. This would seem to be a healthier position, would it not?

Doesn't it seem that the whole ecosystem is being taken care of, even if
it's not everybody in every release? The past couple releases have been
very feature-heavy, but without nearly as much UI for end users. Tons of
goodies for developers, with just a few things that your average user
notices. Don't forget: this mailing list is not your average user, or at
least it's not supposed to be. Our perspective is very skewed.

If there's a release that focuses on making things *such as* theme
switching or previewing widgets/menus/headers/whatever or media management
(something I think both end users and developers can agree could use some
love), I as a vendor don't have a problem with that and rather welcome it
for the sake of clients and the overall longevity of WordPress itself.
Rarely does somebody care about every single feature added to software, but
progress is progress, and just because one of the changelog items doesn't
affect what you are doing doesn't make it invalid or useless. Wouldn't
having more UI make life as a developer easier, anyway?

Somebody has to be the "bad guy" to developers and remind us that
end/non-technical users matter. The number of users on WordPress.com far
surpass what any of us are serving as individual developers or agencies.
They don't know enough to be as vocal as you/we are, but somebody has to
stick up for them, and often it comes down to somebody like Jane. If you
were always being attacked or questioned, wouldn't your emails try to be as
clear and to-the-point as possible? I don't think that's something to get
up in arms about, and really, trying to read emotion or absolute intent
from email (especially on a mailing list) is a useless endeavor.

I think everyone is misinterpreting Jane's attitude here. The point
she's trying to make is that WordPress is made for end-users, not for
vendors. Avoiding making things easier for end-users simply because it
will benefit vendors is not the path WordPress should take.

(Jane, if I've misinterpreted, let me know.)

Message-ID: <CA+sFoLpVxW4eUvrdOdeVOdtxd9vJxq1w8NKgPMK9tZs=9jrLtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am setting up a multisite network with domain mapping.

I am getting crazy with those auth cookies. I enabled Force_ssl_login and
login is properly done over SSL (I use a login form in a wordpress front
end page)

While I can understand why a wordpress_sec cookie isn't set when accessing
the login form in HTTP, I don't get why a non-sec cookie isn't set when
accessing the login form in HTPPS.

Where is the logic in that behavior ?

Regards.

Message-ID: <4F09F94D.5040403@gmail.com>

Hello,

If a user is created on a single site in multi-site, and then deleted, 
that user remains in the Network Admin user list.

This then prevents the user signing up again.

How does a site admin, with access only to their local site, ensure that 
when deleting a user, it gets removed from their local site, and the 
network site?

OR ... when a user is created, create that user in the local site only 
(and not the network user list).

Thanks,
Robert

More claification:
- the user signs up using a custom sign up form and is created using 
wp_create_user function.
- user then exists in local site user list, and mulit-site user list
- local admin for that site then deletes that user, however user still 
exists in the network user list
- the user then tries to sign up again at a later date, however now 
username_exists function will return true because username exists in 
network admin list, but not in local website

Thanks.

I think giving a blog admin the permission to *remove* a user from the
network is a bad idea as it will affect other blogs (you can still add a
hook on user modification checking if it is still subscribed to any blog
and then, remove it if not)
But you can prevent users from login to the blogs they've been removed
from. For this, add a filter to the authenticate hook:

function my_authenticate ($user, $username, $password) {
    if( $user && is_user_member_of_blog($user->ID) ) return $user;
    return null;
}
add_filter('authenticate', 'my_authenticate', 10, 3);

 OR ... when a user is created, create that user in the local site only

As signup is done on the main site, this one is more difficult to achieve.
If you made a custom signup form, make sure no capabilities are set on the
main blog on signup.

Regards.

We did the same thing with a couple hundred users. I'd just be careful what
domain (or fake domain) you decide to use to avoid overlap with real emails.

I'm with Will. Using gmail, you can add variables onto an e-mail address to make it unique. For example, me+this at gmail.com and me+that at gmail.com both go to me at gmail.com.

Sure you could use a free service, like Gmail, but I for one would be more
apt to use an email address created at the domain of my website.

This is what I did for I site I built that needed 100+ "demo" users.  I
randomly created user names and gave them addresses with the
username at mydemosite.com (where mydemosite.com was my URL).  It works fine
and makes WordPress happy because each username needs an e-mail address.

Hi all,

I know how to throw an error when an option box is incorrectly entered -
what is the best practice (outside of javascript) for doing this with a
metabox? Say I have a percentage box, how do I cry foul if it is over 100%,
or fractional and so on?

Thanks a lot,

Alex

For a membership app I built on top of WP, for users without email

It allowed us to run a check whether its a real email address or not;

if ( strpos( $email, '@members.ourdomain.com' ) ...

You could try this plugin

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/allow-multiple-accounts/

it allows accounts to have the same email address.

So you could just create accounts with the same user at domain.com

Hello,

For an app, I need admins to add users that may not have an email address.
How would you handle that case? I would like to avoid a seperate table.

You can add the following in your theme functions.php

add_filter('user_profile_update_errors','allow_no_email',10,3);
function allow_no_email($errors, $update, $users) {
	if (isset($errors->errors['invalid_email']) &&
$users->user_email='a') { unset ($errors->errors);
		$users->user_email='';
	}
}

Above code is also available here: http://pastebin.com/P44V9Edf

The admins need to use "a" for the email, WordPress has it hard coded
that the field is required. yes you could bypass this with a jQuery
script as well :) If you would like that let me know,

You can change "a" to anything, as long as it is a invalid email
address.

I'm not sure what the consequences are of having no email address, the
above just allows you to add a user with no email address.

The change I made was to install the plugin ultimate taxonomy manager, not

Does anyone have an idea what might be?

Hello,

Has anyone ever implemented order categories by custom data?

As far as I can see, WP only allows ordering by title, slug, coutn, 
description etc ... but not a "menu order" as such.

Is there an easy way to achieve this? Need get_terms to return in a 
specific order. Meta Data for Categories maybe?

Thanks,
Robert

Subject: [wp-hackers] Query: meta_key !work right with meta_query
Message-ID: <4F0DC37E.2000805@gmail.com>

Loading posts using a custom meta query in WP_Query. Then trying to use 
a second meta key to sort the data.

However including meta_key makes WP ignore the meta_query. Not including 
meta_key makes WP ignore the sort order.

How do you extract posts with one meta key/value pair, and then sort 
using a different meta key? Am I missing something obvious? This doesn't 
seem expected behaviour.

$args =

'meta_key' => 'secondkey',
'orderby' => 'meta_value title',
'order' => 'ASC',
'meta_query' => array(
     'relation' => 'OR',
     array(
         'key' => 'key1',
         'value' => 'value1',
         'compare' => '='
     ),
     array(
         'key' => 'key1',
         'value' => 'key1',
         'compare' => '='
     ),
),

$the_query = new WP_Query($args);

Thanks,
Robert

Hello everyone,

Did some research, but I was unable to implement it after all.

I have a custom post type accessible only by a new role. I want to filter
the post type listing so that each user should see only his records (as
Author users can see their posts only). I've tried to filter parse_query
but it works for the main listing only (still I can see other records).

Which is the correct filter to use in order to prevent malicious users to
list others' records?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Registering alternative versions of jQuery
Message-ID: <4F0EF623.5060904@gmail.com>

An issue was reported to me about a conflict between two plug-ins, one 
of which I had developed. The issue was that this other plug-in 
de-registered the default version of jQuery and replaced it with 1.4.2. 
This caused issues, as it would with many plug-ins, as I believe how 
jQuery returns ajax requests was changed in 1.5.

The up-shot is, I think it may be necessary to stress in the Codex the 
dangers of replacing jQuery, particularly with old versions.

I also wanted to inquire as to the plausibility of registering several 
different versions of jQuery. This possible for standard websites 
(though a separate no-conflict wrapper is required for each version). 
Potentially, a 'best-practise' could be stressed to register, say jQuery 
1.4.2 as 'jquery1.4.2' and to use the no-conflict wrapper, 'j_1_4_2'.

I'm not that familiar with how WordPress deals with javascript queues; 
Would something like the above work? And should it be stressed (in the 
Codex, says) that plugin and theme authors should refrain from replacing 
the existing jQuery? (I'm aware it says not rely on 3rd party served 
JavaScript files).

Many thanks,
Stephen

Is network_site_url() meant to return the master/parent site URL? Or the 
url of the current website?

The Codex says the current website. If so, you have a bug, as it returns 
the parent/master website and not the current site.

So fix the codex. It's a wiki, people noticing and correcting things
is how it improves.

Indeed I understand how the Codex works - thanks - however which is it 
meant to return?

WordPress sends out it's password reset email using network_site_url() 
as the URL generator for the password reset form, which to me suggests 
it should return the URL of the current site (and confirm what's in the 
Codex) - not the URL of the parent.

Is the Codex correct and the function buggy? Or is the function correct 
and WordPress always sends reset emails using the master parent/site URL 
rather than the current site?

Try something like this maybe?

function posts_for_current_author($query) {
	global $user_level;

	if($query->is_admin && $user_level < 5) {
		global $user_ID;
                                $query->set( 'post_type', array( 'typename'
) );
		$query->set('author',  $user_ID);
		unset($user_ID);
	}
	unset($user_level);

	return $query;
}

add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'posts_for_current_author');

will only show the posts of the current user logged and a certain user
level.

It does the following.

In the edit.php page listing I have "Mine", "All", "Published" and "Draft"
- Mine is correct, but I can see "All" too

WordPress 3.4 now uses network_home_url() in password resets. This was changed in changeset 19705 over the past week.

Correct.
Also, network_*_url() is designed to return Network url's, ie. the
"master" site.
(site|home)_url() do current-site url's.

Message-ID: <CAL1O-KVj=5L7-1M_NjjjGVF1PuJJmy53gdMctXQgVQGCBN1ngg@mail.gmail.com>

Personally, I'm using the function wp_list_comments ('type = comment &
callback = my_function') in functions.php just right I created the code to
display the comments, but something strange is going on, the comments are
multiplied by the number of comments, for example, if I have two comments
is rolled as two loops to display the comments then each one appears twice,
three comments appear to have 9, 3 each and so on.

Has anyone experienced this?

I think that my code used to work as well (your snippet is pretty useful
too) but I probably miss filtering the top links for All, Published etc.
This resource is really useful for my scenario -
http://blog.rutwick.com/display-only-the-posts-authored-by-the-current-wp-user-on-the-posts-page-in-the-back-end

I will have to validate the access to foreign posts via URL after the
resources are hidden. Strange, but I was unable to find a capability level
for post types that denies loading of the post edit (even though updating
is forbidden)

Message-ID: <002101ccd1a8$3677bef0$0100a8c0@corpfe1f3cd943>

I have an WordPress import file with posts, I need to import and convert the posts to a custom type, converting the categories and tags to taxonomies for this custom type, how to do so?!

I tried editing the xml file, replacing the "domain:category" to "domain:type_cat", "domain:tags" to "domain:type_tags" and also replacing type "post" to type "my_type". This worked someway: the post where inserted as my custom type, but the taxonomies are gone. None where created or inserted.

Thanks for any help!

thanks to this list for the help w/ language explaining unique slugs,
for  an upcoming Docs page on Naming Slugs.

now requesting help explaining how slugs come from titles,
esp. re: what chars are/aren't allowed in slugs. have this so far...

-------
WordPress makes a slug from the post's title. Slugs use only lowercase alphanumeric characters, underscore, and dash ([a-z], [0-9], [_], [-]). To generate a slug from a title WordPress:
* Converts accented letters to their unaccented equivalents.
* Converts uppercase letters to lowercase.
* Removes punctuation and symbols, except underscore and dash.
* Replaces whitespace(s) with a dash.
* Removes leading or trailing dash.

If this were the (admittedly awkward) post title:
Here's Lookin' @ You, Ni?o #casablanca 1942-11_26 :-)

This would be the WordPress-generated slug:
heres-lookin-you-nino-casablanca-1942-11_26

Message-ID: <CAN_8tK7m26pxCrE3m1yXOpWHLEjJdBhmaT=iKXbwC04dwAxQMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm listing some data in the WordPress dashboard for a custom post type in
the very regular way - the standard functionality from WP registering the
post type and a custom taxonomy. I'd like to add a filter on the top of the
listing next to the date filter for the taxonomy. In addition to that, each
user can see his own posts only which is an extra filter through
pre_get_posts hook.

It's close to the real deal, but I see many GET parameters in the URL and
after several modifications filter is either not working (changing the
taxonomy ID from the URL doesn't change) or displays 0 to all posts no
matter of the parameter. I've tried to intercept the request and push
there, but no luck.

That's the code I try to use for that sample (modified versions from online
suggestions):

-------------------

add_action('restrict_manage_posts','ulx_filter_categories');

function ulx_filter_categories() {
global $typenow;

 if ($typenow=='customlink'){
                         $args = array(
                             'show_option_all' => "Show All Categories",
                             'taxonomy'        => 'linkcategory',
                             'name'               => 'linkcategory_type'

                         );
 wp_dropdown_categories($args);
            }
}
add_action( 'request', 'my_request' );
function my_request($request) {
if (strpos($GLOBALS['PHP_SELF'], '/wp-admin/edit.php') !== false &&
isset($request['post_type']) && $request['post_type']=='customlink') {
 unset($request['m']);
unset($request['s']);

}
// var_dump($request); die();
return $request;
}

Neither works:

$args = array('author=-2,-3,-4');
$newquery = WP_Query($args);

$args = array('author' => '-2,-3,-4');
$newquery = WP_Query($args);

Subject: [wp-hackers] Too much text in pre tag causes failure to generate
	page
Message-ID: <1326603619.39099.YahooMailRC@web83808.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

I was writing an article on my blog with a huge code dump at the end inside of a 
pre tag. I noticed that this breaks wordpress. This is 100% reproducible by 
pasting http://pastebin.com/6m3RVGbr into a post then hitting preview (You can 
use blank pre tags. I just had stuff in them for a syntax highlighter plugin. It 
doesn't generate a page even with all plugins disabled anyway).

I believe it's caused because there's over 64 KB of data in the pre tags. 
Talking to someone in the IRC and they said:
"looks like there's a preg_replace_callback called clean_pre, probably that's 
what's failing due to size
 basically, probably wpautop()'s fault"

For some reason wordpress won't verify my account to submit bugs so someone said 
I could try here. If someone wants to submit a bug for this I'd greatly 
appreciate it.

Thanks.

That's because the patch never got committed.

Your best bet is filtering the SQL at some point and adding it yourself.
If you really want to avoid that, you could make multiple WP_Querys and
only include a post if it's in all of the objects. That could get
complicated though, so I'd go for the SQL.

Thanks Ryan  - thinking forward, any chance we can get it committed? Is 
there a process for that, that I need to do?

Patch seems good (in my little knowledge).

Unfortunately, it appears that the patch introduces SQL vulnerabilities.

A better option appears to be writing a new patch that would introduce
an "author__in" and "author__not_in", however, no one has done that yet.

Feel free to write one and submit it there.

Message-ID: <CACrqG2vMDOxTq-hx+jKy3JyMqnUnBryQ4zga0LPVvGpHVUpoDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I'm trying to figure out what combination of capabilities are needed to
allow an editor to still edit existing pages but not add new ones.

The Codex seems to say that the same capability applies to both tasks:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#edit_pages

I downloaded the role-scoper plugin to have a peep but there's a lot of
code there. Tried to pick my way through to get a clue but no joy - any
pointers would be really appreciated!

Thanks,
Edward

Message-ID: <CA+yQzrjbxkshw1dkmUfqeU+Y=eU_FKOjD+SfyYr4gah1VHTcTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to dynamically register some hook with the post types, and
custom post type I get from get_post_types().

I first try to do this :

$types =  get_post_types();
foreach($types as $type => $whatever)
{
add_action('publish_'.$type, 'my_publish_post', 99);
}


That code works great for individual installation of WordPress. But when I
try it with Network sites. The array is empty so don't add the actions.

I don't really know how to resolve that. Have you an idea ? I'm guessing
some of you already use something like that to register the hook with
custom post type ?

Thanks.

-Tommy

Seems to work properly on my test install (default PHP settings).

Yes, seems that way. Can you try making the regex in that 
preg_replace_callback "greedy"? I.e. remove the question mark on line 
211 in wp-content/formatting.php so it looks like this:

$pee = preg_replace_callback('!(<pre[^>]*>)(.*)</pre>!is', 'clean_pre', 
$pee );

Don't think the (.*) needs to be non-greedy there anyways.

It is required to be non-greedy. Otherwise, wpautop() would return
invalid html when there are two or more pre tags. For example
"<pre>foo</pre> bar <pre>baz</pre>".

Subject: [wp-hackers] posts_where filter - only apply at certain times
 (getting 404 error on single page)
Message-ID: <4F135132.2030409@gmail.com>

Trying to use the posts_where filter to add an extra "meta_key" check. 
(Basically posts must have (Key A value = 1 or Key A value = 2) AND Key 
B must not be empty).

Got it all setup working fine on the front page / listing page / search 
etc - however when viewing a "singluar" page of the custom post type, 
I'm getting a 404 error.

if (!is_singular('videos')) {} is being ignored at the time I apply the 
filter (returns false), so it isn't as simple as adding that around the 
loop.

Can anyone see where I'm going wrong? Or know a better way of doing it? 
Or know how I can make this filter be ignored on a singular page?

Code below, or at: http://pastebin.com/5gaAQZM4

Thanks!

if (!is_singular('videos')) {
     add_filter('posts_where','posts_where',10,2);
}
function posts_where($where,$query) {

     global $wpdb;

     if (!is_admin()) {

         if ($query->query_vars['post_type'] == 'videos') {

             $new_where = "({$wpdb->postmeta}.meta_key = 'videoid' AND 
{$wpdb->postmeta}.meta_value != '')";

             if (empty($where))
                 $where = $new_where;
             else
                 $where = "{$where} AND {$new_where}";

         }


     }

     return $where;

}

Message-ID: <CAGcUGA9Ne+FB4VjL=O3s-mbeNBic_Ozz09xAQRQyHEZ_bh6nnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to filter the URL of each menu item, not at the moment of
saving the menu but during a frontend request by an user.
My goal is to change the URL of some menu items when the user is not
logged. For example, if an user is not logged I want to change the URL
of a certain menu item in "javascript:alert(bla bla bla)".
Does there exist a filter to do so? Could you please give me a reference?

Thanks

Maybe, I've found the answer:
http://wpfirstaid.com/2010/10/extend-the-wordpress-menu/

Unfortunately, the filter mentioned in that article allows me to edit
only the HTML code but for me it would be easier to edit a kind of
data structure.

I've found the answer by myself, again :-)

The filter in question is 'wp_nav_menu_objects'. Through this filter
we can access a parameter called $sorted_menu_items which is an array
containing an object for each menu item.

Subject: [wp-hackers] New plugin: Groups - looking for feedback
Message-ID: <CAEJE338ifoDo+CbZ-_gzEy6voerFO6OdLSPeNZAPaea05+x3Kw@mail.gmail.com>

I'd love to get feedback on this from users and developers:

I've released the Groups plugin
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/groups/which provides group-based
membership, capabilities and access control. It
integrates with standard WordPress capabilities and also allows to work
with application-specific capabilities.

If you're interested please take a look at its current features, give it a
try and let me know what you think. Here's a summary (there's more but
please read that on the plugin's page):

User groups

   - Supports an unlimited number of groups
   - Provides a Registered group which is automatically maintained
   - Users can be assigned to any group
   - Users are added automatically to the Registered group

Groups hierarchy

   - Supports group hierarchies with capability inheritance

Group capabilities

   - Integrates standard WordPress capabilities which can be assigned to
   groups and users
   - Supports custom capabilities: allows to define new capabilities for
   usage in plugins and web applications
   - Users inherit capabilities of the groups they belong to
   - Groups inherit capabilities of their parent groups

Access control

   - Built-in access control that allows to restrict access to posts, pages
   and custom content types to specific groups and users only
   - control access to content by groups: shortcodes allow to control who
   can access content on posts, show parts to members of certain groups or to
   those who are not members Shortcodes: [groups_member], [groups_non_member]
   - control access to content by capabilities: show (or do not show)
   content to users who have certain capabilities Shortcodes: [groups_can],
   [groups_can_not]
   - Groups defines some capabilities of its own. The groups_read_post
   capability is used to restrict access to certain posts or pages to groups
   (and users) with that capability only.

Looking forward to get your feedback, Cheers :-)

Use an IN compare instead.

'meta_query' => array(
               array(
                   'key' => 'keyname',
                   'value' => array('test','somethingelse')
                   'compare' => 'IN'
               )
           )

Braydon, thank you very much for those hints. But as you say, these
paramaters don't prevent the uploading of insanely large images. I
just tested your code example, and it's actually not solving the
issue, the result is the same as when the limit is set in the WP admin
panel: a very large image (say a Canon EOS 20+ megapixel jpeg) will
still be able to cause harm.

The problem is that the WP uploader *will* be able to upload the
image, so the unaware user will think all is fine, but the server (or
the Plupload script) won't be able to downsize it. So in place of a
reduced image, it's actually the full native file in all it's glory
that gets embedded and brings the page load to a crawl.

I was really hoping that Plupload would provide some way of detecting
such a large image, before WP even attempts to downsize it.

Message-ID: <061D6A4F-2510-4CC6-9FB9-7BD4CB4E1336@justinwhall.com>

Wonder if someone might be able to shed a little light on a few things for me. I recently had a client contact me about about their "new posts" page loading very slow. They were convinced that it was "login with ajax" plugin that was the culprit. My initial thought was maybe there was some sort of javascript conflict. I took a look, disabled and enabled plugins in a variety of combinations and the behavior was inconsistent.

A few details and questions...

1) I did notice that "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" was occasionally loading very slow.

2) Also, this site has close to 3k posts, most of wich are live, few others are drafts and or in the trash.

3) At what point does this become an over whelming burden for your run of the mill hosting plan.

4) Any other tips on tracking down conflicts?

there are a couple of viable answers here

A third option is to append a new message variable to the url (say
"&metabox_message=3"), then on the admin_notices hook, use a lookup
like wp does (its an array of messages on the "3" would be the index)
or however you like.

Hello, all!

I'm up against a wall here.  I'll demonstrate my problem with an

$query->set('category__not_in', $term_id);

But how do I do the same with a custom taxonomy term?

I'm thinking I could use '<custom taxonomy name>__not_in' instead.

This trac ticket seems to suggest that the functionality is available, 
but I can't make it work:

I'm using Wordpress 3.3.1 if it is relevant.  Thoughts?

Thank you very much! :)

I haven't tested it, but you should be able to do that with the tax_query.

You can use $query->set to set a tax_query with your custom taxonomy as
detailed in the WP_Query Codex document.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to let a servlet validate a wordpress session id?
Message-ID: <1326894696.4066.1.camel@i7>

Hello,

I'm searching for a solution how to let a servlet:
1. validate a wordpress session id and
2. retrieve the corresponding wordpress user id.



So far, i see two possible solutions to this requirement:

1. Store the wordpress session id and userid in a database table and let
the servlet query the database. This looks like the simplest solution,
the only question is how can wordpress be convinced to store the
sessionid and userid in a database table?

2. Implement some kind of wordpress
plugin/protocol/IPC-mechanism/whatever to enable the servlet a way to
directly communicate with wordpress. Here I have to admit that I havn't
done any PHP programming yet, so the main question is how could this
approach be implemented? 

But maybe there's an even better/simpler solution. How would you solve
this requirement?
Any advice is welcome,
thanks in advance!

WordPress doesn't use session ID's, so I'm not entirely sure what
you're talking about.

WordPress uses cookies to authenticate the user. If your servlet can
access the cookies, then it can run its own validation on them.

Hello Otto,

thank you for your advice! 
How can a servlet validate a cookie that was created by wordpress?

Some more background information about the project: 
1. An ajax app I'm working on gets embedded into a wordpress page.
2. Wordpress is used to handle user registration and authentication. 
3. The ajax app communicates to a servlet. 
4. Now the servlet needs a way to verify that a request from the ajax
app originates from a logged in user (This is required to access the
users data in the database). But how can this be done?
Both, the servlets (tomcat) and wordpress (apache2) run on the same
machine and access the same database.

Regarding the sessions approach:
I found various sites on the net that advice to place the following code
in either wp-config.php or functions.php to enable sessions:  
if (!session_id()) {
    session_start();
}
This would give me a session id that could be transferted to the ajax
app. The ajax app would forward the session id to the servlet on every
request. But then, the servlet needs a way to validate the session id as
well as a way to retrieve the corresponding user id. 
To conclude it, what I am looking for is a way to let a servlet access
the data of a wordpress user. How does this commonly get solved?
If sessions are the wrong way, how else could it be implemented?
Thanks again for your advice!

If those post types are defined using another plugin (and are therefore
stored somewhere in the options table), then you're out of luck. The post
types will only be available on the blog where you defined them.

The obvious solution is to register them by hand, using
register_post_type().

Actually, I didn't explain very well my problem. Using hook instead of
action and register instead of add ^^

What I look for is to add action on "publish_X" dynamically according to
each custom types (they would be created by hand using register_post_type
like you said).

So what I did the first time is simply to add this in my php file :
$types =  get_post_types();
foreach($types as $type)
{
add_action('publish_'.$type, 'my_publish_post', 99);
}

But that code doesn't work if my blog is used in a network site
installation.
I then figure out that the following code works, but I'm wondering if it's
really correct to do that with this way :
add_action('init', 'my_init');
function my_init()
{
$types =  get_post_types();
foreach($types as $type)
{
add_action('publish_'.$type, 'my_publish_post', 99);
}
}

Thanks.

Oh, I see. The problem was that when you added the code directly in your
PHP file, the post types had not been registered yet.

So yes, moving the code to a callback hooked to 'init' (or 'wp_loaded") is
the correct way to go about it.

Message-ID: <CAEgmxaZv-PBQuQk11d3-gCaWhUMfSnTP2=v-xikutA84Hjk31w@mail.gmail.com>

If I have a taxonomy spanning multiple post types (specifically, I have
added core categories to a 'books' product type), how do I find all the non
empty category terms for 'books'. I.e. exclude category terms that are used
posts, pages e.t.c.?

I can't see any arguments or filter hooks where I can change the behaviour
of wp_dropdown_categories() or get_terms().

I have a noddy solution:  loop through all the terms checking each one to
see if contains posts with the right post type, adding any to an exclude
array that do not. I expect it can have some performance issues reasonably
quickly.

I'm sure I'm being really stupid here so apologies - but where has the 
menu_order setting gone for items in the Media Library?

Need it in a custom WP_Query (using it in orderby) - however can't find 
where you set it in the admin area anywhere!

Can't believe it would have been removed! :-[

hi,
recently i worked on a plugin that it was published out to wordpress plugin
directory in the past years, but
because of no update releases or maybe the bad votes and malfunctionality
it's removed a while from directory.
i'm trying to add the new version of it to repository with the same

any help would be appreciated.
thanks in advanced : )

What would be the best way to avoid adding duplicate links.

Im creating a csv link importer, and using wp_insert_link() , but currently
its adding the link even if one exists with the same url.

The count stored in wp_term_taxonomy is not post_type specific, so
get_terms() cannot support what you are after given the current WordPress
schema.

In a manner similar to how groups and roles differ in real-world semantics.
Groups represent sets of individuals while roles stand for sets of
characteristics (e.g. capabilities) that can be attributed to individuals.

Hi Karim,

One comment I have about the Groups plugin is that it adds 5 tables when I'm pretty sure everything could be handled in the taxonomy tables, the post tables and the options table and at worst case just one new table.  To me and from what I've heard from some other WP developers 1 plugin adding 5 tables is a big turnoff.

JMTCW.

You can use get_bookmarks (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_bookmarks ) searching for
that URL. Import only if it returns empty. Not very fast, though.

Surely getting all links in the db once, sticking them in an array and checking if !in_array would be quicker? If a link is to be added (ie it's not in the array) rather than querying the db again for the next one just add it to the array and do the check on the next one in the csv. In fact you could just add the links that are not already present to another array and then run one insert query built from that array. Only two database interactions for the whole thing. That's what I'd do anyway.

I ended up going with wp_list_pluck

function link_exists( $link ) {
        return (in_array($link, wp_list_pluck(get_bookmarks(array('category' => 2)),'link_url')));
}

Ok, so basically you re-implemented taxonomies for users, except for each
group (or term in a taxonomy) you can also assign certain capabilites.

As Mike said, you shouldn't need 5 custom tables for this.

I surely appreciate your thoughts on this.

While there are certainly many ways to achieve something, these differ in
the means that are used. In this case, they differ especially in the
fundamental principles that are employed.

If anyone wants to build a similar system as Groups and base it on
WordPress' taxonomies, they are of course free to do so. As far as Groups
itself is concerned, it's based on well-known and accepted design
principles in Software Engineering and thus its underlying data model and
the resulting number of tables isn't going to change based on any
preference regarding the number of tables deployed. Why would someone want
to judge a plugin by the "number of tables" it creates? Systems use
hundreds of tables because it's a result of a thorough and sound design,
people you work with large-scale ERP or CRM systems see the need for it
very clearly. Those who appreciate its design may find it very comfortable
to work and develop with Groups, those who do not, should have no need to
feel forced to use it and can use any of the alternatives that are around.

Again, although I appreciate your opinions, Groups' design will not be
based on taxonomies. It's far beyond the stage of discussing the "how to
build Groups" and it's time to talk about "what do you want to do with it"
- of course, only if you want to do something with it.

Because creating extra tables generally means that the plugin isn't
going to scale very well.

Websites aren't like other "systems" and require a different way of
looking at things. Normalized database design principles tend to fail
rather spectacularly when put on the web.

How would those extra tables work with regards to MultiSite as well?

Subject: [wp-hackers] jquery ui :focusable and :tabbable with WP
Message-ID: <CAGEuVU1KEfaZxjcZ7Bie-PNgztabaBnOfQKGFe5vJQjkEWMNTA@mail.gmail.com>

I can't find much apart from this post -
http://brianwhitmer.blogspot.com/2009/05/jquery-ui-tabbable-what.html
- on jQuery UI's :tabbable and :focusable selectors. Discovering them
was a joy, because they fit the bill for a form I'm working on.

However, I can't get them to work with my code. I'm developing a
custom theme for a client. I can get these selectors working on a
static test page, and in a clean WP install - so obviously it's
something in my code. I've tried deactivating all plugins, of course,
no difference.

These are the scripts being loaded, in WP 3.3.1:

/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js
/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.core.min.js
/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.widget.min.js
/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.position.min.js
/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.min.js

I know it's a long-shot and may be just some obscure thing I'll
eventually track down in my code. But there's no JS errors at all, and
I wondered if anyone out there had come across something like this.

Thanks,

Steve Taylor

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multiblog Queries
Message-ID: <CAE+Kyev=CJrjtCDrX01+Ff9516m47QAk04ONE_rp6EkKsy0qYA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a project that requires pulling posts from other blogs in
the same multiblog installation. The best method I've found involves using
the switch_to_blog() function, but this function's documentation points out
that it is a rather expensive process. Even so, I need to do it.

To make the process as painless and effecient as possible, I've begun
developing a Multiblog_Query class that can be directed to retrieve custom
queries from other blogs in the installation and, optionally, merge the
results with the current WP_Query object. I've also included options for
retrieving thumbnails and metadata and making them available during the
loop without additional DB calls.

If you're interested in doing something similar, I've published my class to
a public repository on GitHub (
https://github.com/dagan/WordPress-Multi-Blog-Queries). It's still in beta,
but I'll be maintaining the project and addressing any issues opened.

Hopefully someone finds it helpful. That would make me feel better about
doing the work. :-)

Try executing the code in FireBug or another developer's console. It may
help you track down the issue much faster.

Interesting approach, but I don't think it will work too well when you have
Memcache or similar running.

Also, it won't work with PHP < 5.3 because you use
'Multiblog_Query::filter_get_permalink' as a callback.

It's not memcache that would be affected, but your setup. See

What is a best way to delete post revisions and its metadata?

Run SQL query with joins, or get ID of revisions and then run foreach loop
with wp_delete_post()?

Hello Azizur.

Yes, I've read that and I know how to disable them.

I mean how to delete post revisions via plugin, which is the best way - run
SQL query or loop with wp_delete_post function

Thanks

George

There's nothing on that page about deleting revisions.

I use this plugin:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/better-delete-revision/ - you could
look at the code and see how it does it.

Run SQL queries to do this. You can get them all in one fell swoop.

Simon I know that plugin and it uses SQL queries. I'm wrapping my own one,
more simple and secure.

William, yes I think SQL query will fit more in this situation.

 Thanks, scribu.

I inaccurately assumed memcache was a type and you meant memcached. I know
completely understand, and I appreciate you pointing out the limitation.
I'll make sure to update the documentation to include a hardy warning.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <72291448-69DA-47C1-834D-174175C6F113@getmoxied.net>

Hi WP Hackers,
 
I am in the process of developing a plug-in that will cache tweets from the twitter API and serve the cached tweets if no new tweets are available or the Twitter service is out.  I was wondering if anyone can lend some best practice for this or some insight on a good way to approach this using the WordPress API.

Thank you in advance,

Jeffrey Nolte

This sounds like an ideal candidate for the WordPress Transients
API<http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API>
.

Thanks Chip!  I think this should definitely do the trick.  I actually remember reading about this in the wrox Plugin-dev book.  I will reference this again.

Thanks again!

The transient API would be my immediate suggestion, but I think there might
be an edge case with it. (I've not used the transient API too much, so this
may not be true, but...)

If you set the expiration to be in 30 minutes, and the Twitter API goes
down for an hour, will it not delete the data after 30 minutes, leaving you
with nothing for the next 30 minutes?
A more robust way would probably be to do the caching part yourself using
options, and update it after the expiration *and* you fetch the latest
results.
That way, if something fails, you'll still have the cached data.

If you're looking for the development log or forum posts, the RSS link is on the right side of the relevant plugin page.

Other than that - nothing built-in.

Sure it's discoverable. It's on your plugins forum profile.

*headdesk*

It appears that you have tried to make a plugin called "plugins". So
everything tagged with "plugins" is now going to be listed in your
feed.

Next time, please choose sane names for your plugins. Something
unique. Something that won't be confused for other things. Generic
names are bad for lots of reasons, and you've just found one.

That information is not available in a feed format and we have no
plans to make it available in such a format.

Yeah the page is linked from there, but there's no RSS feed link
(unless I'm missing it).

Ahh. Yeah, the RSS is in the meta for the resulting page itself. I've
gotten so used to having the RSS icon in the browser URL bar for every
page on the web I want to subscribe to that I keep forgetting it's a
Chrome Extension that adds that there.

But the commits can you read via feed about the trac, example:

Message-ID: <CAH9UVvHjGAnb296T=b3YYp8dyL8a-uLw-00BxwTgF85CVZ=uiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello at all,
if I include code inside the html-tab and I switch to the visual mode
of the Editor on post/page, then format WP the code to a block, remove
all breaks and leave lines, see the screenshots at this post on WPSE.
I think this easier to understand as my bad english.
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/39843/no-filter-of-code-on-switch-from-html-to-visual-editor-how

My tests for an solution.
I have test this to stop WP for this with the follow test plugin, also
readable in this https://gist.github.com/1663554

add_filter( 'tiny_mce_before_init', 'fb_tinymce', 9 );

function fb_tinymce( $init ) {

    $init['fix_list_elements'] = FALSE;
    $init['wpautop'] = FALSE;
    $init['remove_linebreaks'] = FALSE;
    $init['apply_source_formatting'] = TRUE;
    $init['extended_valid_elements'] .= ',pre[*],code[*]';

    return $init;
}

Alternative is it maybe possible to change the process viua jquery, an
script which add a process on the tab change of the editor, but not
very fine. Basically an add on for editor.js

Maybe an other reader has an solution for this topic.
THANKS for replies.

Subject: [wp-hackers] usermeta revisions?
Message-ID: <CAK3PZGsYwo_5tyvhN98FUh=G3hdEp__o5drQNaAGYa5dg7+Tmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm developing a membership system built on WordPress, which uses the
wp_usermeta table for adding all of the extra data assigned to users
(address, phone etc).

A problem I'm considering, is how to 'Undo' edits made to users, and how I
could possibly browse the revisions made to a users profile data over time
(and who made those changes).

The solution I've come up with is to save 'revision' entry to the usermeta
table, with a serialised array of all of the user data, along with the
timestamp of the revision, ID of the user who made it, and a list of the
modified fields. Something like:

$revision = array(
  'timestamp' = 2012-01-20 23:41:27,
  'revised_by' = 123,
  'first_name' = 'John',
  'last_name' = 'Doe',
  'user_email' = 'hello at example.com',
  'modified_fields' = array( 'first_name', 'user_email' );
);

Which I could then use to compare revisions etc.

Does anybody have any suggestions for how this could be achieved in a
better way perhaps?

This is the code causing the error:

(function($){
$(document).ready(function() {
	$('#footer a').click(function() {
		if (this.href.indexOf('wordpress.org') == -1 &&
this.href.indexOf('http') == 0) {
			recordOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', this.href);
			return false;
		}
	});
});
})(jQuery);
</script>

It's around line 333 in http://codex.wordpress.org 's code.

It seems the function is being closed twice.

No, there's nothing wrong with that script, except poor indentation.

Consider it this way:
(function($) {
	$(document).ready(function() {
	       $('#footer a').click(function() {
		       if (this.href.indexOf('wordpress.org') == -1 &&
			   this.href.indexOf('http') == 0) {
			       recordOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', this.href);
			       return false;
		       }
	       });
	});
})(jQuery);

Perfectly fine, as far as I can tell.

Problem is that jquery.js isn't included in the codex header. I'll fix it.

The edit_* capabilities control both creating new ones and editing those
you have rights to, there's no way to stop people from creating new posts
without removing the ability to edit them entirely.

That said, if you have edit_* without publish_* then you can't publish
posts, only 'submit for approval' which makes them 'pending' status. This
means that if users create posts they are effectively inert and it's easy
to enforce a 'no new posts' policy. It may be somewhat confusing to people
because the 'add new' link is still there, but the UI makes it clear that
they don't have permission to publish. If you wanted you could use jQuery
or something similar to remove the 'add new' links for people without the
publish_* capabilities. They would still be able to access the add new
screen if they visited it directly, but it would avoid the clutter and they
still wouldn't be able to publish anything.

I'll also note that it sounds like you need users with edit_others_*
capabilities as well, because you say 'editors'. By default you can only
edit posts that you are the author of, if you have edit_others_* then you
can edit them all. I think this will work even if the user doesn't have
publish_*, or at least it should (it's a rare use-case, and sometimes rare
combos of capabilities have unexpected results so test it carefully).

Is there an action to do so? I am looking for it both in the codex and

Subject: [wp-hackers] Optimize wp_register_script and wp_enqueue_script
	functions
Message-ID: <4F208F34.8040708@gmail.com>

Hey all,

As I know, most of the plugins use wp_register_script() and 
wp_enqueue_script() to add js files into frontend pages. The current 
functionality will affect page load speed if you use many plugins. The 
problem is if you enqueue a js file, it will add this file to all the 
frontend pages, no matter if it is been used in these pages or not.
For example, I add a plugin to vote categories which has two script 
files. They should be only been added in the category page, but turn out 
wordpress adds to all the pages like index, post and page. It is not 
good for site performance.
My current solution is to write a function to deregister all the scripts 
and add them back on different pages, and then hook this function to 
init action.

It would be great if wp_register_script and wp_enqueue_script have the 
feature to target the script to specific pages. Ultimately, it would be 
even great if wordpress support javascript lazy load (on demand). I am 
sure we will get a lot of performance benefits from it.


Any suggestions and comments?

Presumably, you're putting your wp_register_script() and
wp_enqueue_script() calls inside a callback function, hooked into e.g.
wp_enqueue_scripts.

If so, simply wrap your wp_register_script() and/or wp_enqueue_script()
calls inside an appropriate conditional, such as if ( is_category() ).

Also note that, as of WordPress 3.3, inline script enqueueing is now
supported. (I've not used this feature, so I don't know the details.)

Aloha,

I've been thinking about potential GSoC 2012 projects (yeah, I know it's
not announced yet ;-) ) and came to the conclusion, that rather than adding
new features, which wait in a long queue along with other improvements,
maybe it would be a good idea to do a project which would significantly
improve the quality of  Unit Tests. As WP grows, there will be more and
more patches breaking stuff instad of improving anything, and it would be
nice to improve the current code coverage.

Any thoughts?

cheers,
W.

Great Idea. It would be nice to create wpautop() and shortcodes tests
too. I've prepared some of them one day so please contact me if you're
interested.

Another work around instead of real solution, is if you can wait until the
user is added, then there are suitable hooks on the edit user page

show_user_profile and edit_user_profile for displaying the fields
personal_options_update and edit_user_profile_update for saving the data


If the user can register themselves, then you can always hook into the
wp-login page to add the additional fields there

Thank you for both comments. The problem of these solutions is that developer or blogger have to go through the plugin code and write a filter function by themselves. The shortcode solution is better, but in some cases you can't put all js files in the footer.
Would be better to let plugin authors to do this, and bind (or register) js files to specific pages not all?

Thanks,

As of WordPress 3.3., shortcodes can enqueue scripts inline.

Unit tests would be really awesome. Both for the standard unit test purpose
of providing more stable code that is less likely to break when changes are
made, but also to let WordPress stand out as a good example of how it
should be done :-)

Hi Wojtek

You might find parts of a plugin I had started useful for writing
tests -- this was intended to help write unit tests for Wordpress
plugins -- and can generate stub functions/classes for testing after
parsing wp-core/any folder you care to specify, which can then have
their behaviour specified using PressTest code
.(https://github.com/kunalb/PressTest/blob/master/mocked/core.php)

https://github.com/kunalb/PressTest . It itself has a few unit tests
that check PressTest itself, and I'd gotten started with
https://github.com/kunalb/EventPress/blob/reboot/ptests/includes/kb-at-Test.php
as well, for examples of usage.

Best,

Kunal

If it's not covered by https://github.com/nb/wordpress-tests or
http://unit-tests.trac.wordpress.org/ , it should have a unit test in my
opinion.  None of the JS is currently unit tested.

I believe this thread was started by simply not being aware of existing  
tests for WordPress and the coverage of those.

I would raise this question again after checking resources that Aaron  
already posted, and the answer you will discover (probably on your own) is  
"Patches welcome!".

What I would really love to see, is a travis-ci or some other CI setup for  
a real-time overview of current codebase modifications.
Also +1 for adoption of some JavaScript testing framework and adding some  
tests for UI/UX responsible code.

I don't follow your point - I know exactly what's the coverage of these -
hence my question about specific parts of code that developers think should
be covered first. Since I'm looking for interesting projects for GSoC this
year, it seems like a pretty valid question to me.

I think that we should improve the coverage of the existing unit tests
first, rather than take on JS tests and have another semi-finished feature.
But this will probably be discussed at least a few more times.

cheers,

My point is that GSoC is not and should never be used for the scope of  
writing tests and only that.

In fact, I doubt that its a good idea to advertise yourself on wp-hackers  
as only being able to write tests, which leaves the impression that you  
are not able to produce anything else but test others code.

Since I have already contributed to WordPress in GSoC for two years in a
row, I don't feel the need to "advertise" myself - why would I? My only
goal was to start a proper discussion concerning the need for unit tests vs
introducing more features.

Leaving your personal remarks behind, thanks for the input related to the
potential project goals.

The people who said unit tests would not be a welcome project were 
wrong. As the person who oversees our GSoC participation every year, I 
know for a fact there are at least three core people who would be 
psyched to mentor a project focused on tests. We even had two project 
suggestions on our Ideas page last year at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2011 that were testing-specific.

I apologize if my point was understood as discouraging, but what I was  
really referring against, is "improving coverage" not about "fixing the  
tools".
CI and enhancement of the test-suite was something I meant in my initial  
post.

Hopefully my messages will be considered in a constructive way.
Sorry once again.

As far as I can tell from a Google search[1] and from answers on 4 questions[2] at StackExchange's WordPress Answers, there are really only a total of 7 other pages[3-9] on the web about Unit Testing for WordPress. 7 pages out of 60+ million blogs and billions(?) of total web pages generated by users of WordPress software.

7.  Total.  Pages!

Earth has a better chance of a catastrophic asteroid collision[10] than we have of finding useful unit testing information about WordPress on the web.

And 1 is a readme, 2 are home pages for a trac and svn sites, respectively, 2 are codex pages with at best linked example, 1 minimal coding how-to from the guy's at Chicago Tribune's ChicagoNow.com (IOW, nobody directly related to the WordPress core team.) The only reasonabke good one if from Nikolay Bachiyski on WordPress.tv, and it is a video.  IOW, 1 reasonable how-to which being a video doesn't even allow you to copy the code. Out of billions of web pages.

I'm not pointing fingers at *anyone* for *not* having done more. My team has badly needed to implement unit tests for our internal framework and sites built using it but we have yet to have the time to devote the minimum of 1-2 weeks to research and build proof-of-concepts to allow us to discover best practices for WordPress unit testing. 

But I *am* saying Wojtek is neither an idiot nor a jerk for asking about unit tests, and I feel confident all the +1's were in part because of the dearth of how-to information and best practices about unit testing WordPress projects. So I for one would applaud *any* efforts to emerge how-to information and best practices for unit testing on WordPress related projects.

One of the problems with that idea is that WordPress doesn't currently have a simplistic way to identify a specific "page." Each resultant "page" is represented by an array elements in $wp->query_vars which are set by $wp->parse_request() when it attempts to match the current URL with the URL rewrite rules to determine those values. And $wp->query_vars can also contain elements that don't effect URL routing so you can't just URL encode that array to get a unique "page" identifier.  

Plus it's also possible to serve pages via the 'template_redirect' hook so you can't even depend on the results of $wp->parse_request().

So unless and until WordPress core were to standardize some method of specifying "pages" via a simple identifier (which I would be excited to see happen) then your idea is a nice one but not realistic.  FWIW.

I disagree. Tests are an extremely valuable component of all projects
and are equally as deserving of attention as any other code (if not moreso).

+1 to the idea, by the way. One area that urgently needs testing code is
the AtomPub/XMLRPC interface. I've written some code towards that from
my Code-In project last year, and I believe Westi is working on that at
the moment.

By the way, it's not working well because WP prints all html code in
the footer. Sometimes js/css code need be added in the head section
because of the long loading time. Try to build a website with css
files linked in the footer to see what I'm talking about.

I'm sorry, but once again, I don't recall myself or anyone here, denying  
the value of the tests.

Anyway, it's good to see the problem of code QA (and not only the tests  
coverage) raised, but until .org team have an official position, it's just  
us ranting this subject.

The lack of unit testing resources, as Mike Schinkel showed, align with my
+1. *Any* unit testing work attention would be beneficial.

Based on both + & - responses about tests, part of catching-up in unit
testing will involve classifying unit tests better (such as: PHP tests, JS
tests, data model tests, etc).

As for documentation being important - it absolutely is. I would never have
started using WordPress if it weren't documented (in v1.5 that was
relatively-speaking to other tools). Documentation as a part of SoC is also
common. Students are required to report on their work, and public docs are
usually part of that. There are also instances where entire SoC projects
were to write docs (2009 Perl project, 2010 Scala project, and 2011 Point
Cloud).

Point being ... I'll back up any unit testing app to SoC, even if only to
document the current test resources. It would help in finding both
deficiencies and future projects.

I'll add to that to say that if someone decided to specialize in setting up unit testing for WordPress projects, especially to include PHP/plugin tests, jQuery/AJAX tests, MySQL/query tests, HTML/CSS tests, etc. he or she would certainly get paid handsomely for their expertise.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Sending checkbox parameters to a non-PHP script using
	wp_remote_post
Message-ID: <CAMg3evEU9D26u6EgDjgYVPLGZyYz03GJW5Bvi=Q8NT-13iZ0eg@mail.gmail.com>

I am using wp_remote_post() to submit some data to a Google form and have
run into an issue I am not sure how to address.  I think the crux of the
problem is how PHP and Python deal with named parameters for checkbox
inputs.  In PHP if I have a group of checkboxes with the name "icecream" I
will only the get one value passed and it will be the last of the
checkboxes checked so instead of "icecream" I would use "icecream[]" to
name the input and I'll be able to process all of the selections.  Pretty
standard stuff.

On a Google Form all of the checkboxes in a group have the same name but
they don't have the array syntax.  On the Google side (which to the best of
my knowledge is powered by Python) it somehow manages to process these
inputs which all have the same name correctly.  Looking at some Python
examples it appears that there is a language construct to extract multiple
values from what appears to be a single named input.

My question is this - what does the HTTP request look like and can I mimic
it with wp_remote_post()?  I am not sure how to take the values for my PHP
array "icecream[]" and configure the parameters for wp_remote_post() so all
the checked values will be sent to Google which is expecting a parameter
called "icecream".

Thanks.

The raw HTTP data to the PHP script will look something like:

	icecream[]=a&icecream[]=b&icecream[]=c

It sounds like what you'll want for the other API is something like:

	icecream=a&icecream=b&icecream=c

To do that, you'll have to create the string yourself and send that as
the 'body' option to wp_remote_post(), as it appears http_build_query()
and family don't handle this (which IIRC, is what WP_Http will use
internally).

(If you want to doublecheck any of this, try sending a GET/POST request
to one of the http://httpbin.org/ URLs; they're fantastic for testing with.)

Did somebody say *Unit Testing*?

If you guys want to do unit testing on plugins, or even the WordPress core,
check out the substantial improvements the BP-Media team has made to the
WordPress Unit Test system.

http://code.google.com/p/buddypress-media/wiki/DOCS_bpm_unit_test_top

If twenty people +1 the wiki page to show us there's interest, we'll spend
a weekend properly documenting BPM-Test for you guys to use, as per our
usual standards<http://code.google.com/p/buddypress-media/wiki/DOCS_BPM_db_top>
.

Also, if the core WP devs are interested, we could modify BPM-Test to be a
drop-in replacement for the current WP unit test runner.

Message-ID: <6d041eabf66f5aa96b4e5fc066a3ec9f.squirrel@webmail.plus.net>

Just been reading the Gardening updates (Great to see the updates from the
teams by the way!), and was hoping to try and get some issues on the list
for  inclusion in 3.4.

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11571
New API (get_the_post_thumbnail_src) - seems lots of people want to do it
given traffic to my blog post about it  - despite there being existing
"easy" (But evidently not well known about) alternatives.

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11058
New API (unregister_taxonomy_from_object_type)

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19708
Bug fix - get_post_custom returns no data when cache addition suspended.
This is exposed by the introduction of wp_suspend_cache_addition in 3.3 as
with #19690 which Ryan's already kindly committed the fix for.

Happy to help provide any more info if required, but all three have
patches and I'm happy to work on any issues anyone has with them to get
these in.

I'd be grateful for any feedback.

Thanks

Thanks a bunch for the pointer to http://httpbin.org and the suggestion for
manually building the body parameter for wp_remote_post().  The web site in
particular was extremely helpful in solving my problem (which is now
working - yeah!) as it allowed me to get my post using wp_remote_post() to
match exactly what going through the normal Google Form process posts.

Just check the wordpress initialization process and drew several flow 
charts of it. I believe 'template_redirect' is called after 
$wp->parse_request. And there are a lot of other action hooks before 
these two steps that can be used. Please check the flow charts 
<http://www.zhaiziming.com/zZ/2012/completely-wordpress-initialization-flow-chart-1/> 
I drew.
Since shortcodes can support inline script enqueue. I am fine with it 
for now. Thank you for your comment.

Each resultant "page" is represented by an array elements in $wp->query_vars which are set by $wp->parse_request() when it attempts to match the current URL with the URL rewrite rules to determine those values. And $wp->query_vars can also contain elements that don't effect URL routing so you can't just URL encode that array to get a unique "page" identifier.

Subject: [wp-hackers] DOING_AJAX all the time
Message-ID: <CAGEuVU0cEBVwAu5JK_FNpA_46OaPoSnqsE_6qr9fdpbmTJv+Sw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a site in development that seems to think it's DOING_AJAX all
the time. There are AJAX aspects to the front-end, but even non-AJAX
requests seem to have this flag set.

So, if I put this line in header.php, functions.php, a plugin:

<?php echo 'DOING_AJAX: ' . ( DOING_AJAX ? 'yes' : 'no' ); exit; ?>

Even if I just make a plain request to a page in the browser, I get:

DOING_AJAX: yes

I'm rushed so I'm heading for a workaround for now - just wondered if
anyone had any ideas?

Needless to say I've double-checked for the constant being defined,
and it's only in admin-ajax.php. Any idea how this may be being
included on a normal request?

Thanks,

Steve Taylor

Message-ID: <CAF_N5_SUvJB605xZOE6-Q0NZ=wa51LYM2arTbXFvzGw3hB=UVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
As part of this
<http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/dev-chat-notes-01042012/>(Dev Chat
Notes for January 4, 2012) I would like to introduce a new idea for people
(students, one time commiters, etc) who would like to participate on making
WP better. It's Easy-Hacks. The same thing has Libreoffice (OpenOffice.org)
here <http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks>.

Step 1 :

My idea is this. Every time someone from the core find some task, which
he/she thinks is an easy one, will be tagged as an "EasyHacks" (for further
reading just EH). Such tasks could be taken either from the "Future
Release<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/Future%20Release>"
or from "Awaiting
Review<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/Awaiting%20Review>".
There are over 2600 tickets and I am sure we can find a few dozens, which
are easy and to be tagged "EasyHacks". Such tasks could be from every
component. Even some of them are from year, when there were versions of WP
such as 2.x. etc. Of course, some of them are stupid and should be delete.
But many of them we can make EH.

Step 2 :
After making a just a few of them (at least +-20 at the beginning) we will
announce it on BLOG. During that time I (+ others) will write in a codex
similar page, which has Libreoffice. For example, I will update and add the
articles about TortoiseSVN
<http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2005/11/03/windows-wordpress-toolbox/>etc.
Basically I will rewrite LibreOffice page for the Wordpress-users.

SO here just with the lowest (of course doesn't mean the easiest ones)
priority. Even some of them have already patch.:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12738
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/15828
This will be also my "goal=homework" to find them.

Please, Think about it, how we can solve 2 Problems with one solution. 1.
Problem : we need (and also want) more commiters. 2. Problem : Many
students want to help us, but don't know how to help (and e.g. they don't
have big (mean professional) skills).

Enable PHP Warnings/Notices and you'll get an error along the lines of
"Constant DOING_AJAX undefined, Assuming 'DOING_AJAX'" (a string).
so what your code is really saying is... If the string "DOING_AJAX" is
not empty, echo yes.

This is because the DOING_AJAX define is only defined when it's true,
so you should be doing:
if ( defined('DOING_AJAX') && DOING_AJAX )

As a easier way to catch this, always use something such as var_dump()
and inspect the type of the variable printed is what you expect (ie. a
boolean, and not a string of DOING_AJAX).

You seem to gloss over a step: someone needs to review and commit those
patches.

So, I don't see how encouraging more people to submit easy patches will
lead to more commiters. (In the WordPress project, very few people have
commit access)

I think you may mean contributors, not committers :)

Some tickets have been tagged as easy-fix. Would be nice to see that used
more, although what's considered easy for one person may not necessarily be
easy for others:

Another solution could be to have another post type that uses an 
alternative editor instead of TinyMCE, such as ACE. That way the visual 
editor works as usual, and html can be better written with the other, 
such as posts that are mostly about code.

Hi Bradon,
no, the users will use this on default post type post and page, no CPT.
I thinked, WordPress must have filter and hooks for this, on the
standard TinyMCe works fine, is an problem of the JS for the editor
and this js has no filter; only deactivate and rewrite is possible.
Best wishes
Frank

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using wp_localize_script() more than once for same
	script
Message-ID: <CALS5Swd3ZHyZ879EDPVG59W+G++PSV6bHaXW9xWFwN6aqyTj1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The title of this post may be a little misleading, so I'll explain what I'm
trying to do and hopefully the question I'm trying to ask will be clearer...

I've created a widget that displays a jquery carousel. The carousel's
scripts are being enqueued mid-page via add_action('wp_footer', array(
$this, 'enqueue_scripts') ) within the widget's widget() method. The
enqueue_scripts() method does the actual enqueueing using
wp_enqueue_script() with $footer arg set to true. Additionally, since there
are various parameters for the script managed via the widget's control
panel, I also use wp_localize_script() to send these PHP parameters to
javascript [see note 1 below]. All of this works perfectly.

However, I want to allow the widget to be used more than once on the same
page. The jQuery script itself can handle this OK, but I cannot assume that
the parameters used by the js will be identical for all instances of the
widget.Therefore, I need a way of using wp_localize_script() more than once
for the same script $handle, so that each widget instance can use
wp_localize_script() with its own set of parameters. From what I can see,
this isn't possible because wp_localize_script will only output one set of
parameters per file $handle.

What I'd like to have is this (or variation thereof) if two widget
instances are present on the same page:
https://gist.github.com/1710421whereas what is actually output is only
the parameters for the last
instance of the widget, not both instances.

Do I have an alternative other than to go back to the "bad old days" of
echoing out script tags via the wp_footer hook?

Hope my question makes sense. Thanks in advance for any insight!

Ade.

Have you tried looking for a plugin that sets a maximum upload size? I know
that PHP can set limits on the biggest file you can upload, so you could
use that as a way of stopping users from uploading enormous photos, though
you'd also be blocking uploads of other filetypes that actually need large
file sizes. If you can control the server configuration then you can
definitely set maximum upload size directly in the PHP ini files.

Hi
scribu I am deeply sorry. Of course (thanks Helen) i mean contributors and
not commiters.
Basically, Student find some ticket, which is tagged as easy-hacks
(easyfix) and will do a patch. Someone from the core (not only etc.) will
make sure nothing breaks (and it works fine) and as a result it will be
make as "closed".

On the PHP side could prevent the upload from completing, though after a 
wait; the wp_handle_upload hook could be the place to check and return 
an 
error.<http://codex.wordpress.org/index.php?title=Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_handle_upload&action=edit&redlink=1>

IMHO, the last thing a relatively mature codebase like WP needs is people
randomly tossing in a bunch of "easy hacks".  Every piece of code needs to
understand the context it is in, needs to respect the coding, data, and
structural paradigms, and needs to play well with the past, present, and
future of the codebase.

In my experience, some of the most insidious bugs in the projects I have
worked on were introduced by well-meaning people who simply didn't
understand the context well enough.  I would rather have some of these
small, even trivial, bugs lie fallow rather than have them "fixed" in a
way that introduces more bugs, more complexity, or even hamstrings the
codebase against some larger, more elegant, long-term solution that may be
in the works.

But that's just my $0.02,
Chris

It should no longer generate those thumbnails for new images uploaded if 
it's not set, however any images that have already been uploaded will 
still have the size, since it's already been generated. The plugin 
Additional Image Size ( 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/additional-image-sizes-zui/ ) can 
handle deleting unused image sizes.

I have on several occasions talked to the people behind the Linux
distribution Exherbo[0]. They have had great success getting new
contributors onto the project by keeping a bunch of low hanging fruits
around. This is stuff that is not critical, ie not security issues and so
on, but small easy to grasp usually nice-to-have features, that could
easily be fixed by the core developers. They make sure to always keep some
of these issues around to give aspiring contributors an easy way to get
started on contributing.

I really like this idea and I know, as mentioned, that other projects has
had great success with it. I think one of the biggest problems to getting
new contributors on a project is that first commit.

Hi,

All this easy-hacks thingy sounds much like a primitive code review  
workflow.
Nowadays this problems are solved by tools like gerrit/patchwork or  
continuous integration systems.

I understand that everyone wants his patch accepted or reviewed, but the  
problem you described can't be solved like that, simply because more  
patches doesn't mean more code gets accepted. And it's a bit unfair to ask  
a developer to do a job that can be automated (like codestyle check,  
validity of the diff file, quality of the code).

The example with a linux community is also a bit unfair, since a linux  
project is usually split into submodules and sub-projects that have own  
maintainers.

To sum up my thoughts, it's not the workflow that has to be changed, it's  
that WordPress needs more tasks to be automated before a patch review  
request is fired to devs.
In the end, as scribu said, it should mainly simplify the commit process,  
not replace it.

As a parallel note, there's a thread "Unit Testing" that was started,  
which questions solved, could definitely simplify the commit process.

Ahh ok, because I was generating an array of image sizes for insert to post
via the media manager, and it was listing ones I previously made.

I'm in a similar position. But my concern is more about the number of
usermeta rows I'll be adding.

For each user I've got at least 15extra fields of data I need to store
(some boolean, some text).

I'm guessing usermeta is the best storage option, but that table could
get very big, very quickly!

Duh - thanks!

I always used to think that was a dodgy behaviour for constants (to
return true when not defined). Then I forgot about it and they bit me
again....

If you have 10,000 users you're still only talking about 150,000 rows
which is nothing. If you're on cheap hosting then you'll run into
concurrency problems (the number of simultaneous requests MySQL can
handle) long before you'll run into speed problems.
