Term meta has been argued a lot.


Tom, Could you send me the link whe the dicussion takes place?.
Is it this  http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10142 ? This one looks
like taxonomy meta though.

thx.

Thanks Luke. It seems like I'd need to create an entirely new view by 
extending wp.media.view.MediaFrame.Post, and then remove the Gallery 
tab, change the Insert Into Post button, etc. My initial attempts at 
that didn't work out, though, and I've already spent more time on this 
than it really warrants, so in the interest of being practical I decided 
to compromise and just give the user an extra text field if they want to 
enter a remote URL.

My problem is not with taxonomies, but post types.

Are you saying that you have post categories assigned to posts and to a
custom post type? And that you want to use get_categories() to retrieve the
categories for the custom post type?

If so, you are probably not using them correctly. If categories apply to
both posts and a custom post type, it doesn't make sense to request a list
of just the ones assigned to a particular post type.

And if some category terms only apply to the custom post type, then you
probably should have created a custom taxonomy for that custom post type.
Then get_categories() could be used to retrieve the terms for just that
custom post type via it's custom taxonomy.

Although it hasn't been updated for a while, as far as I'm aware this
plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/taxonomy-metadata/) still works
fine.

At least it is working happily on a site I built a couple of years ago,
which is updated almost daily and which has more than 40,000 records using
multiple taxonomies with meta data.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Best methodology for running wp-cron on separate
	server.
Message-ID: <CAOwP8kx-uUC0MitskD723gJjLhFegLMo78DQ_WXt2mTuypUsSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
  I am wondering if anyone has any experience with having mutliple
load-balanced servers and trying to run wp-cron on only one specific
server.  I have tried this a few ways and I am not sure the best approach.
Here are some ideas I had and if anyone has experience with this I would
love to hear it.

1. Ideally, it would be nice if I could use something like Gearman to
'farm' out the jobs to servers I desire as things scale.  It seems to me
that what the Gearman worker would need to do is fire up WP via wp-load run
its job and return the data.  This way I can scale as needed to multiple
servers that are not web servers at all (as in they don't attach to the
load balancer)

2.  I could have a web server that I weight very low in the load balancer
that runs the cron.  The question then becomes how to tell wp-cron to run
on only that server.  My initial attempt was to wrap all of the add_actions
in an if that looked for a specific IP and have pingdom hit that server
every minute to make sure the crons did run.  I didn't have much success
with that because there is no guarantee that WP will try the cron on that
specific server and if it is on a different on it seems it will just skip
it.  I have seen some thought about adding a transient if it runs on
another server but I'm not sure that that will scale nicely and we would
end up with code all over the place.

Maybe I should just pose the question to you WP experts out there...has
anyone ever tried to offload processing of wp-cron and come up with a
methodology that works?  I would be more then happy to hear any advice.

Thanks,
Ryan

The easiest way to accomplish this is to set up a cron job on that server
that runs `php wp-cron.php` every minute. Then disable the cron in
wp-config.php using DISABLE_WP_CRON. Or, you can trigger an HTTP request
(such as through pingdom, as you said) directly to wp-cron.php on that
server. That too, will fire the cron. There are plenty of more advanced
ways, such as by setting up an actual jobs system to manage scheduled
events. Note that hitting wp-cron.php will need to happen for every site ?
this is a particular consideration in multisite. Again, there are more
advanced ways.

I understand the issue. Its one I've dealt with before, albeit awkwardly.

I agree with Mike that there's often a better way to define your data. But
in
some cases, I've explicitly wanted to use custom taxonomies to link posts in
different posts types. And it has been frustrating not being able to query
onlyterms that have posts of a given post type.

The workaround I've used is to temporarily modify the definition of the
taxonomy
I'm trying to query, making sure to reset it to its original definition
afterwards. You can do this because all the taxonomy definitions are stored
in
the global variable $wp_taxonomies:

    global $wp_taxonomies;
    $backed_up_tax = $wp_taxonomies['yourcustomtax'];

    // Redefine the taxonomy to only apply to the post type you want to get
    // terms in
    $wp_taxonomies['yourcustomtax']['object_type'] = array( 'yourposttype'
);

    // Now query for the terms you want. Make sure to leave 'hide_empty' =>
true.
    // The generated SQL will include `wp_posts.post_type IN (
'yourposttype' )
    // becasue of the taxonomy definition
    $terms = get_terms( 'yourcustomtax' );

    // Reset the taxonomy definition. IMPORTANT.
    $wp_taxonomies['yourcustomtax'] = $backed_up_tax;

A way more in the the spirit of WordPress might be to do a regular query and
filter out the result, but this approach was quicker for me.

(Note: this is kinda pseudo-code, didn't test it, so I may have left out a
step.)

Message-ID: <CAOwP8kyXE=ouajDrKEK+o2bTJgGHW_Gx72SjOaOBcw2dMeY7Jw@mail.gmail.com>

A quick question:
One of my weekend projects is creating a Instapaper/Reader type app using
WordPress.  It all works great for storing bookmarks but I am running into
a bit of an issue if I want to scale this beyond a single user.  I
currently have a Post Type of 'bookmark' and a custom tax for users to
categorize these bookmarks as they see fit.  The issue is mainly that terms
are defined on a global level and there is no way to have a term have an
'author' or to only be specified by user.  I could use a term meta plugin
but that becomes an issue when trying to use the loop (WP_Query).  Does
anyone have a good data architecture for something like this?

In short....each user would have there own taxonomy terms for their
specific bookmarks and only those would show up on a page.  I would need to
get these terms without having to go through each term.

Some way to do this is to suffix / prefix the custom taxonomy with some 
user specif data upon registration

global $current_user;
register_taxonomy( "genre_{$current_user->ID}", array( 'page' ), $args );

this approach has some implications of course and you shouldn't use it 
if none of them come to your mind :)

Nice.  That is at least a workable solution.  I don't see too much issue
with that except there will be a bunch of taxonomies created ( 1/user )
which I can hide from the UI in the backend.  This isn't a production site
so unless there is an issue I am not seeing this will work.  I would be
interested in hearing what your idea of the negative 'implications' might
be.

I don't see any real issues with this solution, except that it shouldn't 
become a practice with public projects / plugins / themes, imho.
So I thought I post my answer with some words of caution.

I've done something similar with post types for user specific blogs / 
contents without using multisite. But, and this is a possible 
implication, this can lead to some extra work to make things accessible 
to non-logged in users etc..

Depends on the usecase..

We use this solution for custom post types and taxonomies on a larger scale WordPress project and I have yet to find any downsides. In our special case the users never get to see other users content so we simply register the taxonomy bound to the current user id on init. I can image that if the content was public to anybody registering a few hundred taxonomies and post types on init could create problems.

There's always the chance of "term collision" between taxonomies.

Today it appears that GoogleSpell is passing errors back to WP/TinyMCE when
evaluating messages for spelling errors. Then WP/TinyMCE is not properly
catching this, but returning "no spelling errors found." I can't find any
info about this on social media, the Internet at large, TinyMCE or WP
boards. Anyone else having this issue, a workaround, or details on whether
this is an outage or a policy change?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CA+-Vqo_q3ZKf5h42_FeAA3Js1QYVB_ih9aHmjtd6szRRt_qpcQ@mail.gmail.com>

This idea is a simple one: encapsulating the post-based template tags
(the_ID, the_title, the_content, etc) and make them methods of the WP_Post
object.

Basically what this does is allow developers and theme makers to take
advantage of the template tags in custom loops without actually messing
around with the main loop or the global $post and removing the need to
reset post data. Since the template tags use post data to begin, it makes
sense for the core logic to be in the WP_Post class. The global template
tags can just call the methods of the global $post object in a main loop.

For example if you have a custom query:

$query = new WP_Query();

Instead of calling the_post to load the global variables, you could do:

while( $query->have_posts ) : $query->next_post();
    $query->post->the_title();
    $query->post->the_content();
endwhile;

Basically, you call the template tags directly from the post instead of
messing with the main loop variables.

+1, except this would be even better, uses __get():

while( $query->have_posts() ) : $query->next_post();
   $query->post->title;
   $query->post->content;
endwhile;

Or both could be supported for those who dislike overhead of __get().

I think your example already works in the current implementation.  The
reason I recommend the template tags because they use filters that you
still may want to use in a secondary loop

Nope. These instance properties are currently available:

$post->post_title;
$post->post_content;

But there are no instance properties like this:

$post->title;
$post->content;

However I'm not as interesting in what they are called but instead in how they work. I was suggesting being able to access via __get() not via instance properties.  Why?  Code like this with "virtual" properties implemented via __get() would work:

$html = "<a href='http://example.com/?p={$post->ID}'>{$post->title}</a>";

But PHP does not support code this:

$html = "<a href='http://example.com/?p={$post->the_ID()}'>{$post->the_title()}</a>";

My proposed example assumed filters too.  I should have been more explicit.

Awesome idea.  I was looking at the code and he only thing I have an issue
with is content.  The template function has a lot of coupled code that
pretty much assumes you are working in a main loop.  I gutted the other
template tags, turning them into wrappers and moved their logic directly in
WP_Post but left the_content pretty much as is.  How exactly would I submit
any changes to TRAC?

Message-ID: <028001ce3259$a95b8ab0$0200a8c0@TITA>


Hello,

I'm not sure it this is something I'm missing or it just happens. I noticed that when using the_category() top level categories position varies within the output? e.g. sometimes a top level category can stay after a child category in the array. Beside some functions do ok in breacrumbs (in single posts), I can't get this work in post listings.

I'm want to display the categories in posts this way "top level / child / child". Found a "reverse" function but then some categories lists get messed (as it says: it reverse the array).



Thanks for any help!

Message-ID: <CAGbA+aaP5C-nqwU8J6Rd0VCRmo6MCmHDZ=SSTa+fE823TDgEhQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've registered custom rewrite rules and query_vars to use for displaying a
list of events based on ISO date format. For example when a user requests
the URL, http://site.com/by-date/2013-04-04/, my quer_var is the date
portion and I'd like to display a list of events who's meta_key of
_event_scheduled_date equals the ISO date value in the query_var.

Whenever I try the following code to modify the $query in the pre_get_posts
filter WordPress initiates a 404 and no posts are queried. I've been able
to use pre_get_posts to manipulate other taxonomy listings, archive pages,
etc, but have yet been able to get it to work correctly with the custom
query_var/rewrite rules I've created.

Pastebin to code I'm using: http://pastebin.com/rbLwWU4S

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks everyone,

plugin in a multi-site install where it's not running on the main site,
thus no "Update" notification or link is present.

I saw something a few weeks ago, but didn't keep the link.

Go to wp-admin/network/plugins.php Which is actually where you go for 
all plugin updates on a Multisite.

Message-ID: <CAB7iSnbJ3T9MvNw5kJ=Jb2U-gv5gy4mnnrJR5BpgUOMW46Aa=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm Lasindu Charith, a Final Year student of Department of Computer Science
& Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I'm quite happy to see
that Wordpress has been selected for GSOC this time, so that a lot of WP
lovers are given the opportunity to work on what they daily use.

After going through this list of ideas in the GSOC2013  page, I found this
project - New User Walkthrough to be quite interesting and merges with many
of my fields of interests. I have worked with WP for years and created
dozens of sites using WP. I have a good experience in working with PHP,
MySQL as well. But I certainly need to grasp better WP development
experience.

After reading the project idea as well as the previous GSOC project done on
the same area way back in 2010, I'm wondering why it is not used in WP. So
few of the concerns I had was,

[1] Seems like the requirements/ideas changed while the project moves on,
due to some usability issues.

[2] It would have been better if the users/webmasters are given
more flexibility in managing the module (to choose what should be the steps
in the walkthrough etc.)

May be Webmaster should be given the opportunity to pick the User
Walkthrough module to be included or not in the WP installation wizard and
may be this module should be configurable to be suited for different types
users from the WP backend.

This idea of introducing a Walkthrough module will be quite useful for a
newbie and  might not be as useful for a experienced user. So there should
be definitely a way to disable it. (My idea is to provide the option in the
installation wizard-may be with a simple checkbox and the option might be
altered from the WP back-end in case user finds it important or annoying. )

So I would like to know developers' thoughts as well, and any ideas of
where I can start off with. (May be some documentation, exercises, issues
where I can get a better hands-on experience towards the project. )

Thank You,

Lasindu

Thanks for the reply Mika, but it doesn't really address the issue. I have
a plugin that is active on 1 sub-site only and needs an update. Since it
isn't active on the primary site, the update notification doesn't appear in
my plugins page. In this specific case, I can just do an FTP update. No
problem.

I'm actually looking for a programmatic solution. I saw something about
creating a meta-plugin that goes into the MU folder or something to handle
this case where the core WordPress install doesn't run the update check
because it isn't actually running the plugin. To be clear, I wrote the
plugin in question above.

You only asked how to update a plugin on a Multisite Install when it's 
not on the main site, and that answer remains "Visit the network plugins 
page" :) Though in my experience, even plugins not running on that main 
site get alerts if you're logged in as the Super Admin.

For programatic ways, I just use Pento's plugin: 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/automatic-updater/ and you could 
easily fork that for your needs. WP-CLI is also a good tool for this 
one, and you could script a shell script to check if it's the latest 
version and update if not.

MU Plugins never check for updates, this is 100% correct, and it's why I 
don't recommend putting real plugins in there and only my 'functions'.

WordPress in multisite mode lists all plugins on all sites in the Network
Admin interface, and checks for updates on all of them as well, whether
they are network activated or not. There is no code in WordPress to make it
"not check" a deactivated plugin.

All discovered plugins get checked for available updates.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSOC2013: Widget Collections..
Message-ID: <CAFtaa=TwkPq=cJnQSubTxu69H05_uRaDE5T7RKpTJpB5fGmMEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone!
I am Alex and am studying Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabr?ck,
Germany. Until now I've only got one plugin  in the repository [1],
currently working on a second plugin and a first publik theme. Before I
already created some websites using WordPress as CMS.

I would like to contribute to WordPress as part of the Google Summer of
Code. I am open to project ideas, my current idea proposals are the
following:

*1. Widget Collections*
The Idea is basically to overhaul WordPress core widget handling, while not
changing anything for theme designers. My input for it comes from [2].

At the moment the backend presents sidebars where you can stuff your
widgets in. When changing the theme your sidebars break apart and you have
to reassign all individually. For bigger sides this can be quite a pain.
Also some sites change their sidebar setups on a regular basis.
This is where "widget collections" hooks into: The idea is to be able to
group widgets into collections. The backend layout mostly would stay the
same. When widgets are assigned to an sidebar and the theme changes they
will automatically be assigned to an collection on their own which will
hold them together and be represented by a dashed line around the widgets
which are part of this collection in the "inactive widgets" box.
Collections can be dragged to a sidebar just like single widgets can. Also
users will be able to assign names to the collections.

When hovering an sidebar which contains widgets users will be able to
create a collection from the assigned widgets. So they can move the whole
collection to the inactive widget section.

Sidebars will be able to hold more than one collection at a time. Adding
new widgets to collection should work just as adding widgets to sidebars.
You could say that collections are "widgetized sidebars". Drag, drop and
assign them like widgets, but they hold widgets like sidebars do.

*2. Supercharge Text Widgets
* Depending on how long 1. takes I would also like to approach
"supercharging text widgets" [3], because it goes hand in hand with 1.

I think the best way to do this is save the content of text widgets as a
post of their own, add basic tinyMCE capabilities (text-styling, lists,
links) and (maybe) add a "full editor" button which would open a restricted
edit.php

* 3. Code editor overhaul with code revisions etc
* While I guess 1+2 will be enough for me I also think that a code editor
(plugin and theme) revision system would be nice. There was already an
"theme versioning" [4] project in 2011, but it is quite outdated and does
not work with 3.5 for me. If this would be introduced as core featured it
would also be good to overhaul the editors. At the moment the editors are
nice to have, but not really usefull. No line numbers or anything. There
are plugins which fix that, but I think a lightweight enhancement without
blowing the sources up should be in core. Same about on the fly child theme
creation like [5] (did not test it). This would really come in handy when
users need to edit theme files to make plugins work and would help plugin
authors when supporting their users ("fork this theme including single.php,
paste this code into it"). But I think the code editors have not changed in
ages, did they? Any thoughts on this? I do not think to be able to fit it
in gsoc, but would be keen to introduce this in trac and help on it in the
future.

This mail got longer than I expected it to.. Looking forward for some
feedback! :)
Alex

Hi all,

I'd like to have a "blog image" for each of my multisite blogs.

My current working solution is to add a custom input field to the
Settings >> General page that will accept an integer (the
attachment_id).

I should add: I have not researched if the above idea is even a viable
option. I know I can easily add an input field to the settings page,
and it's simple enough to get and input an attachment id ... Just was
curious if there's a more elegant solution.

I really wish WP blogs had a "blog image" upload field by default.
Seems like it could be helpful, esp. for a multisite install.

Hi. I am Udit Saxena from BITS Pilani, India. I?m currently doing my
bachelors in Computer Science and master in Mathematics.

I?m interested in applying for GSoC under Wordpress. I have experience in
C/C++, Python, Java, MySql, HTML5, CSS along with basic PHP, Javascript and
Jquery.

I?ve gone through the list of projects and ideas on your page and I?ve
listed the ones I?m interested in:


1. Create a simple native web app for Blackberry 10: the Blackberry API
supports Apps built in HTML5 using webworks, which can then be pushed onto
their tablet or phones. I have experience in HTML5 and consider this an
amazing opportunity to contribute to an up and coming app base (BB10 OS). I
am currently getting familiar with webworks, their HTML5 platform. Can this
be a potential summer project ?


2. Photo instant upload to Google+/Facebook/Dropbox for the wordpress
mobile app: Something like this can be incorporated in the above idea. I am
not familiar with either of Android's or iOS's NDKs but is something I can
look into under some guidance.


3. Port wordpress for webOS to Ubuntu Mobile. Though not familiar with
webOS, Ubuntu mobile development also provides app deployment in HTML5 or
QML or an integration of both. I plan to learn to get around their
development suite in a day or two.


I am quite enthusiastic about app deployment in both BB10 OS and Ubuntu
Mobile in HTML5. Something I will really look forward to for the summer.

I am still getting a hang of your codebase and plan to submit a patch or
fix a bug by this weekend.

Can you guide me to (potential) mentors for the above mentioned projects ?

Thanks.

Hey Udit,

If you got time  today you should try to visit the mobile meetup later today on IRC. I don't know if GSoc getting discussed but I guess it's good to show your interest there.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Proposal: JSON REST API
Message-ID: <51652E91.5070802@rotorised.com>

Hi hackers,

There's at least a few of you out there who know me, but for those who 
don't: I'm Ryan McCue, a second year student at the University of 
Queensland, Australia. I'm currently studying Bachelors of Engineering 
(Electrical) and Science (Mathematics). Most of you will know me already 
via SimplePie, the feed parsing library included in WordPress, or my 
contributions to core.

For this year's GSoC, I'd like to propose a JSON API for WordPress. I've 
mentioned this project previously and have already outlaid part of the 
code to do this: https://gist.github.com/rmccue/5022591d312952d1245a

The scope of this project under GSoC would be the following:

 1. Develop the critical infrastructure to power a JSON-based REST API

    This is the most basic pieces of the REST API. This includes routing
    URLs to methods, handling JSON serialisation/unserialisation,
    ensuring compatibility with various servers/proxies, etc

 2. Create a REST interface for generic post types

    This involves creating a generic infrastructure to turn an internal
    representation of a post into exportable data (including
    normalisation) and vice versa.

 3. Building off the generic interface, create more specific interfaces
    for built-in types

    For example, posts should expose their comments in a nicer way,
    attachments should expose metadata relevant to their content, etc

 4. Ensuring that the API works well with clients

    Unless the API can work well with clients, it isn't of much use to
    anyone. This part of the project would involve creating new clients
    (for example, a Backbone-powered interface) as well as working with
    the mobile teams to gain support for the new API.

An important part of the project would be ensuring that a) all WP APIs 
can be expected to behave in a similar manner; and b) plugins can easily 
extend the API and create their own more specific APIs. To this extent, 
the project would also involve creating a proof-of-concept extension of 
the API for a specific plugin.

Why a REST API? At the moment, the only real API to access WP content is 
the XML-RPC API. This requires a full suite of parsing tools and is less 
than optimal for most users. In the past, XML parsing (usually with 
libxml) has caused problems on mobile platforms, which are the main 
consumers of the API. A JSON REST API removes much of this complexity by 
using a simpler serialisation format (JSON) with a protocol usable by 
most of the web via standard HTTP verbs.

Why am I qualified? I'm the lead developer of SimplePie, which is 
roughly 10% of the WP codebase, and is a fairly complex piece of 
software to maintain. I have previous experience with working with 
nuances of HTTP clients and servers, via my Requests project (a PHP HTTP 
client, similar to WP_Http). I've also already made a start on this due 
to personal interest, and although it has taken a back seat, I've 
already been able to create clients that use the primitive start I've 
created. I also have a fairly intimate knowledge of WordPress and have 
contributed many patches in the past.

I'd love for comments and questions on this.

Note on mentors: Marko has indicated previously that he'd like to work 
on such a project, and has also applied to be a mentor. While GSoC 
requires that students create most of the code, the project could be 
structured in such a way that we can work on separate parts of the API 
together. Brian Petty and Eric Mann have also indicated they'd like to 
mentor such a project, and both would be great choices as well.

Thanks,

Hi Ryan,

as far as I know ther plugin JSON API (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/) do most of the work you
mentioned. I used it once and it seemed very robust to me.
Maybe this could be a good start to implement the API natively into WP.

Hey Filippo,

I've actually investigated the previous solutions somewhat, and they 
have several problems:

 1. They aren't designed for core integration, and are intended to
    always live as plugins. This is a problem for something that should
    be in core.
 2. They aren't very robust for custom post types. Most of the existing
    ones are tailored to posts and pages, not the generic system of CPTs
    and taxonomies that WP has
 3. They aren't very REST-ful. A lot of the existing ones are basically
    JSON-RPC, which I've argued against before, since it's mixing things
    unnecessarily (IMO)
 4. They aren't very WordPress-y. WordPress has a bunch of (often
    strange) ways of doing things which most core developers are
    familiar with, and these plugins usually eschew those.

With the plugin you linked, it's vulnerable to 1, 2, and 4. It's very 
plugin-oriented (IMO), CPTs are an afterthought (mainly due to the age 
of the plugin) and it doesn't seem to follow WP paradigms (it has 
controllers/models, which most of WP doesn't).

If the project is accepted, I'll definitely take existing work into 
consideration, but most of it isn't that great. The best inspiration so 
far has been WP.com's API endpoints.

Thanks,

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC2013: Designing Better Wordpress App for Windows 8
	PC/Slate.
Message-ID: <CAKs3b0iHc72q3rHwj=UPpiZ1uX1KQS=s=W4dnDnX49+ntW8J1A@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy,



Congratulations for being part of GSoC13.



I'm Akshat  Kumar Singh, doing my Bachelors in Computer Engineering from
University Of Pune, India.

I have my own project idea related to mobile app. I have named it as:-

"Designing Better Wordpress App for Windows 8 PC/Slate".



What are my concerns with current Wordpress App on Windows 8?

   1. The current app is too laggy to be usable (Unstable and Crashes).
   2. Layout is beautiful but less features are making it a peace of crap
   (has far less features than its sister apps on iOS and Android).
   3. App is not utilizing all features of Windows 8(lack of 'Top app bar',
   'likes, and comments live push notification on start menu').

Conclusion: Wordpress App needs a strong update.



How and why I think I can be useful?

   1. I Have developed many Windows 8 App which includes Maps App(
   http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/maps-app/4244505e-90a0-4b6f-8943-d751272bfe0d
   )
   2. Maps App was one of the top app on windows 8 for a month (overall
   free apps).
   3. I have used HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3 for all my apps, and
   luckily current Wordpress App is using the same technologies.

Conclusion: I can put my expertise to improve Wordpress App.



What are the features, I'd like to add?

   1. My top priority would be to make the App stable.
   2. I?d also like to add Dashboard, Stats and Comment page on the app.
   3. I?d also like to add many small features like push notification
   service, multiple local drafts capability, capability to switch between
   different blogs from charm setting.

Conclusion: Decreasing the gap between the current Wordpress App on Windows
8 from its sister?s apps on iOS and Android Platform.



Problem I want to solve?



This project will result into a perfect companion for the Wordpress
bloggers out there on Windows 8.Thus making millions of bloggers happy.



Please provide feedback for the scope of this project. Hoping for positive
response.

+1 for this.

Having investigated the JSON plugins out there I have never found a decent
one that integrates well. I'd love to use WordPress to easily with JS
frameworks (including Backbone.js which comes with WordPress now) but
haven't had the energy or the time to implement a full and stable version
to do basic stuff and full custom post type things.

Is this Gist usable?

All the best,

Alex

included) about a JSON API here: http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23099
 .

The whole thing is usable, yes, and I'm currently using the core of the
API in Feast: https://github.com/rmccue/Feast

It is just a start and it's soalphaithurts, so please don't use it in
production. Working with Backbone, I've made some small improvements to
it already (for example, renaming ID to id as per the Backbone convention).

Thanks for linking that; I tried to find it, but couldn't remember the
title.

Further justification for the project, as I eloquently put:

> JSON isn't the solution to every problem, and if the problem with implementing XML-RPC in other languages lies with the XML parsing (I'd be surprised if libxml isn't available in those) then that's something that needs to be solved in those languages. Implementing RPC in JSON feels as if we're attaching wheels to a boat. It may have some utility, but in reality, I don't think it's useful.

All 4 main points you outlined and really great overall goals, and I
agree on all counts.

I might also add that building off of #2 and #3, it's also important
that the REST API offer a clean and simple internal API to extend it
and offer additional REST routes for other functionality and
information not just for additional core features (possibly even
jumping into things on the admin side for managing menus for example),
but also for plugins much like how the XML-RPC API can be easily
extended by plugins.

Additionally, since we've recently learned from our mistakes already
in regards to this, it's important to make sure any new API that this
project offers always consumes and delivers non-escaped, raw values
(outside of JSON of course) where possible. Some available hooks and
filters may make this difficult in many places. I haven't had time to
fully review your proof-of-concept implementation yet to ensure it's
following this guideline, but just wanted to make sure this was
discussed.

In regards to GSoC, this is definitely something that couldn't fit
into the core release schedule, so I imagine an end goal for the GSoC
deadline would be a usable (even if still alpha quality) plugin on
WP.org. I know you know this already, but just re-iterating it for
everyone else.

Also, for GSoC, this is indeed something that additional people could
help with during the program as long as the mentor(s) are only grading
your code and performance, and that shouldn't be a problem. Although,
while others can lend a hand in this, Google has been clear that two
SoC students can not work on the same project. So we just can't have
two students working on this at the same time (for any other students
that thought this might be possible).

Hi all

I wish to participate in the GSoC 2013 under WordPress.

I went through the Ideas Page for WordPress. I liked the creating a
Front-End Posting template tag idea.

There are already quite a few plugin in WP.org plugins directory which
provide the option to add a post from the front-end - some of them very
popular. So, my guess is adding a template for front end posting would be
helpful.

I would love to hear your feedback on taking up this as a project for GSoC.

Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] Post types and redundant taxonomy terms
Message-ID: <90E99FDDD045415BB588FD0A63521EAC@gmail.com>

Hi all, hopefully my question makes sense. 

I have an implementation that is working for the problem it was meant to solve, but it's inelegant and seems kludgey, yet it's the best solution I could think of and I wanted to see if anyone else has a better suggestion.

We have a section of our site for Resources. In this case, it's a listing of terms belonging to a taxonomy named "resource-category". So we have terms like White Papers, Tech Guides, Instruction Manuals, Videos, and Webcasts. We are also using a plugin that allows us to add extra fields to the taxonomy terms, so that the listing can have icons and descriptions.

Now these are comprised of posts of a few different types. One CPT is simply called "resource" and consists of only a title field, description, and URL to a PDF. This is used for the White Papers, Tech Guides, and Instruction Manuals. Another CPT is called "video" and has some different fields, while the "webcast" CPT has yet another set of fields. 

All of these CPTs use the "resource-category" taxonomy. So, this works, but it seems redundant to add a post to the video CPT and then have to also add it to the Videos resource category - that said, I can't think of a better solution. 

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Josh

Hi guys,

I'm a undergraduated student from Brazil and I'm interested to apply to a
mobile project in this GSoC. Well, I'm studying the code to create a
consistent proposal, then I'm with some doubts.

The ideias that I'm interested are:

1. Create a native WordPress Sharing library + button UI for mobile
apps(for iOS);
2. Make WordPress for iOS a share target for other mobile apps;

So, I'm thinking in solving some bugs to understand the code and the
current software architecture. Could anyone give me tips or says me what
are the files that implements features like create and update a post or upload
media?

I've downloaded the iOS code, and I'm goint to starting to study it now.
My priority is to develop a native WordPress Sharing library + button UI
for mobile apps(for iOS).

Thanks, and I'm waiting for replies.

Hi Ryan,

This sounds like a really great project, especially if it can make it's way into core. I've wanted WordPress to support a RESTful JSON interface for years now so if it can become a reality that will be great.

On Apr 10, 2013, at 5:19 AM, Ryan McCue <lists at rotorised.com> wrote:
> I'd love for comments and questions on this.


Looking at the code it's rather impressive but do have several questions:

1.) Are you envisioning a true REST API or more or an JSON-over-HTTP API? In other words:

a.) Will clients using be it be required to be 100% hypermedia driven, will clients use URL construction, or will you allow the clients to decide which approach they choose to use?  For a simple discussion of this:

http://www.emergentone.com/blog/the-future-is-hypermedia/

b.) Will you implement a WordPress-specific media type, something like "application/wordpress+json" or just use native "application/json" or use a hybrid like either "application/vnd.siren+json" or "application/hal+json?"

2.) Do I understand correctly that you're proposing a URL structure such as this (this example retrieves a post)?

http://example.com/wp-json.php/posts/{$post_id}

3.) Have you considered adding a version number to the API to allow the API to change in the future in case it is needed? See: 

http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/10/25/web_api_versioning_smackdown

4.) Will you provide a method to discover the JSON API's root URL?  Offering this will allow API clients to automatically find the API even if the API URL has been changed is a hook. For example, a <link> header, something like this:

	<link rel="wp-json" href="http://example.com/..." />

5.) It appears you are implemented basic HTTP auth against a user account, correct?  Do you envision a class of API user that cannot be used to login to the website but can use the API?  What about API keys, or better yet both two-legged and three-legged OAuth 2.0 support?  

I ask these because basic auth is known to be insecure without SSL and could result in people gaining access to sites and a JSON API can't depend on nonces for security if it's going to be useful for anything besides AJAX. I know most sites logins are insecure but an API used for ongoing automation will present a much larger window of opportunity than an occasional user login.

6.) Will the JSON api be disabled by default and require the admin to enable it?

7.) Have you considered an additional form of API that would support JSON endpoints for the regular APIs on the site, like how this works:

http://teamtreehouse.com/tobypowell78
http://teamtreehouse.com/tobypowell78.json

BTW, I'm not suggesting you should make it hypermedia although those on the rest-discuss[1] and many on the api-craft[2] lists most certainly feel otherwise. But I do think it would be good to use a specific media type such as a single 
 "application/wordpress+json" media type for all JSON returned by this API.

Regarding mentors it seems you have some mentors lined up but in case you can have multiple mentors I'd be very willing to offer to be a mentor on this project. Working is APIs is one of the main things we do at NewClarity and I've personally had a keen interest in APIs since literally 1997,  been studying REST since 2006, wrote about it related to WordPress in 2008[3] (I was brand new to WordPress plugin development in those days) and have been working with APIs for clients for the past several years.

We also have a GitHub project called RESTian designed to allow mapping of specific API to enable creation of classes to access the specifics of the API that don't require the user to understand low level HTTP, for example[4]. It would be great to be able to release a RESTian-based API client for this API when the API itself is released.  We also recently wrote a JSON server[5] although it was not generic in order to meet to client's short timeline[6].

It would probably also be a really good idea to get someone really strong in security to co-mentor. I think it takes a special mind for security and this project could indeed create a big security problem if not carefully reviewed for security. (Not me, I'm not a security expert but maybe Jon Cave or Mark Jaquith.)

In summary, would love to see this get a green light, would love to hear the answers to the questions above, and am available to help as a mentor in whatever capacity is needed or desired.

In the past, XML parsing (usually with libxml) has caused problems on mobile platforms, which are the main consumers of the API. A JSON REST API removes much of this complexity by using a simpler serialisation format (JSON) with a protocol usable by most of the web via standard HTTP verbs.

Hi Josh,

We handled a very similar use-case via a "type" meta field and it has worked out really well.

Applied to your use-case if you were to use our solution you would collapse all posts currently in the post types "video" and "webcast" into the "resource" post type. Then you would use a post meta field called "_resource_type" where you'd assign it values of "general", "video" or "webcast." Next you would display your edit fields based on the resource type. And finally you would collapse your resource categories of "Videos" and "Webcasts" into a single term, maybe "Videos/Webcasts", "Visual Media" or something else that works for you.

In your case those resource types dictate what data entry fields are required, and the resource categories will provide users with filtering capabilities.

You could also use a 2nd "Resource Type" taxonomy instead of a meta field but unless you want to enable all these URLs:

	http://example.com/resource-types/general/
	http://example.com/resource-types/video/
	http://example.com/resource-types/webcast/
and:
	http://example.com/resource-category/white-papers/
	http://example.com/resource-category/tech-guides/
	http://example.com/resource-category/instruction-manuals/
	http://example.com/resource-category/visual-media/

I think post meta works better.

One final thing; if your users still want to filter for "Videos" vs. "Webcasts" then you could have the user's selection of the resource type for a resource auto-assign the resource categories of video and webcast, as applicable.

Hope this helps.

-Mike

Let me just prefix this entire reply to point out that this is just
the birth of a REST API to begin with, and it wouldn't be in core
immediately in 3.7 (and probably not even 3.8). As such, you can
expect a very stripped down, simplified REST API only covering the
basics. The goal for something deliverable by the GSoC deadline needs
to stay reasonable and achievable with only 2 months of work.

This is one of those "extras" that isn't necessary for a first draft,
and shouldn't be any kind of goal even for whatever might be finally
merged into WP core, well past this GSoC project proposal.

It would, without a doubt, be the typical "application/json" content
type, but worth noting that there's not much stopping it from also
including "application/xml" if clients prefer XML instead of JSON.

> 3.) Have you considered adding a version number to the API to allow the API to change in the future in case it is needed?

Considering the tradition within WP to only maintain one version
number, it would likely just expose something to check against the WP
version itself. I've seen quite a bit of resistance from even
suggesting that the plugin API maintain it's own version, so I highly
doubt this would qualify for it's own either.

However, you do have a good question here, and it would be something
to discuss if this project was accepted.

Also applies as an "extra".

I agree that OAuth 2.0 would be great, and maybe even a requirement
for merge into core (I can envision *tons* of clients/consumers that
would require this), but I still don't think this falls within GSoC
project scope.

It goes to a plugin first, and we would consider this upon merging to
core, but I would imagine that based on the decision to enable XML-RPC
by default in 3.5, this would likely do the same.

> It would probably also be a really good idea to get someone really strong in security to co-mentor.

Yes, this would be good, but we haven't even discussed whether this
API would include authenticated API endpoints yet within the GSoC
project timeline.

Along these lines, I'm not sure yet if we should be looking at request
rate limitations yet either. At least this would be distributed, but
I'm certain we would end up taking a ton of hints from the WP.com REST
API: http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/

WP.com does support OAuth 2.0, but doesn't even include request rate
limits itself yet either.

Yes, I know it was loaded, but not for the reasons you imply.  I wanted to determine if Ryan and others understood the objective meaning of REST or if it was understood from conventional wisdom. But I only wanted to enable discussion on the topic if the understanding wasn't clear.

That said I was not by any means trolling I am truly interested in being supportive of the effort.

So, you are correct there is no "standard" because REST is not a specification, but there is an objective definition for REST as an architecture. Roy Fielding coined the term "REST" and thus he is accepted as the one who gets to define what REST is and what it is not[1].  And there is no debate from the active members on rest-discuss or api-craft over this fact.

To be truly RESTful then an API must (among other things) "use hypermedia as the engine of application state."[1] It also requires a specific content type[2].

Note[3] I was not a "RESTifarian" in 2006 nor am I one today although I do understand REST much better today than in 2006. Said more directly, I don't think hypermedia should be a requirement but I do think that if hypermedia is not a requirement then the API proposed is explicitly not RESTful[1].

> It would, without a doubt, be the typical "application/json" content type, 

I think that would be result in huge opportunity missed.  

There is lot of benefit to a specific media type which Fielding recognizes[2] not the least of which is that a WordPress API client can know unequivocally that it is accessing a known JSON type with WordPress-specific semantics and that will allow for WordPress API browsers to be developed as client libraries (but we'd want only one media type, not a bunch of them.) 

Compare HTML to XML; when a browser requests and receives an HTML file it know about and knows how to handle elements like <img> and <table> whereas when it gets XML it can only know the syntax but not what it can do with it.  

Since WordPress has more than 17% of the web we have the potential to define and implement a highly influential and very useful new media type. If however only "application/json" is served then the result will be no consolidation around a "known" media type and much less related innovation, especially related to how WordPress could interact with media types.

This is a concern with or without merge to core because of the traction that it will likely see over time. If "application/json" is chosen, that decision will pretty much be "baked" in.

The idea of changing the API when a user upgrades a site is VERY troubling. I'm glad you said it was something to discuss further.

The tradition of maintaining only one version of WordPress is in my opinion a very good one, but an API has very different considerations than WordPress itself. Consider if WordPress releases a new version then sites owners can either upgrade or not.  For some site owners this is very annoying but overall it is best for everyone.

However envision that this new API could result in hundreds of mobile apps that use the API.  Then the next version of WordPress changes the API and now all those mobile apps break for ever site that has been updated to the most recent version.  It's like how a country can dictate laws for their own citizens but cannot force their laws on citizens of other countries who do not choose to travel to their country simply because they've published on the Internet; you wouldn't want Iran's or Russia's laws to apply to you when you post to your blog, would you?  Why is it appropriate that we force every Android and iPhone app developer to upgrade every one of their apps on WordPress' schedule?

So we can dictate versions upgrades to the WordPress community but it's not good form to attempt to dictate the need to upgrade their app. How will the app even know the behavior of an API for a site it is connecting to? This would be as bad for developers as IE6 was! Just like browser sniffed apps would have to do API sniffing. Ugh-ly! 

And if we do it will create a nasty black eye for WordPress the first time a major app that uses the WordPress API breaks because of such intransigence. The trade press will have a field day and those of us who believe in WordPress will be put on the defensive.

However, even if people don't agree today's solution is very simple; just begin the API's URLs with /v1/. If backward compatibility is always maintained we'll never need to change it.  But if we do decide we need us having added that will give us the flexibility to add a /v2/ in the future is we realize we need to. This is not "user facing" so it really does not to follow API best practices.

Same concern here as with media type for not merging into core because traction will "bake" this decision into future core implementations.

That is a trivial implementation and doing so will enable mobile and other apps to access sites without difficulty for users; not doing so would sadden me for the opportunity lost cost.

I'm assuming a merged into core.  If not, it's not (yet) a big concern.

I concur if not yet merged into core.

One thing about WP.com is they use HTTPS[4] which is not very common on most sites. Reading this rant[5] from the OAuth spec author which was effectively about authentication schemes that don't use SSL was very sobering.

A lot of what I'm bringing up here I've learned from both experience and by following lists like rest-discuss and api-craft. If this GSOC project gets greenlit I would really hope that Ryan and his mentor(s) would join the api-craft list at least and run architecture decisions by them. Collectively the people on that list have learned many lessoned about web API architecture and it would be a shame for the WordPress community to be saddled with the issues associated with learning web API best practices via trial and error when there's so much about web API architecture that is already known. To be clear, I count myself as still having a lot I can learn from them too which is why I monitor the API Craft list daily.

Message-ID: <CAHPce6mn+Xh9rTaKskJdMy=Qb6oCJ8THHcS6B8UXgPD8SZbqTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Greetings Wp-Hackers,


Myself Vishvesh Shah. I am currently pursuing Bachelors in
Information Technology Engineering from Charusat University, Gujarat, India.

I was going through project ideas of WordPress for Gsoc 2013. & found ideas
very interesting. Specially mobile app development.

There is one proposed idea  "Photo instant upload to Google+ / FaceBook /
Dropbox for the WordPress mobile apps", i am willing to do work on that
project.

I am having some basic experience of developing windows phone application.
& can contribute to the organization by developing this feature.


*Why we need this feature in WordPress Mobile App?*

Nowadays many good applications come with this instant photo upload
feature. For example Like a user at some place sees beautiful scenery &
capture that in own smartphone. & by using some app he/she uploads
instantly on Facebook or Google+.

Current windows phone WordPress app is having good & basic features which
satisfy all requirements of a blogger. But if the user wants to publish
his\her photos at the same time on Facebook or Google+ or Dropbox ,there
isn't any feature.

*How this feature can help?*

When we are maintaining our personal "Dear Blog" , we won't need separate
application to just upload photos. We can have our photo with some write up
on our blog & at the same time on uploaded over our Facebook wall. Isn't
that interesting ?..:)

Yeah, it will be always the user's choice after all ,that he wants to
upload it or not..:)



So, I would like to know who is the mentor of this project, & if i am
missing any point give me guidance regarding that.
Awaiting for reply.



Thank you.
Vishvesh Shah

Hey Mike,

Hybrid. URL construction can be used if it's easier, but most endpoints
will provide hyperlinks for clients which want to support that. To that
end, an index will also be provided to enable full discovery of the
endpoints.

> b.) Will you implement a WordPress-specific media type, something like "application/wordpress+json" or just use native "application/json" or use a hybrid like either "application/vnd.siren+json" or "application/hal+json?"

"application/wordpress+json" would be nice, but requires an IANA
registration, which likely means going via an RFC. Given that the format
is for WP interoperability (for the foreseeable future, at least), the
type would either be "application/vnd.wordpress.api+json" or simply
"application/json" for maximum compatibility.

Correct.

> 3.) Have you considered adding a version number to the API to allow the API to change in the future in case it is needed? See: 
> 
> http://www.mnot.net/blog/2011/10/25/web_api_versioning_smackdown

I'm a huge fan of mnot's posts (especially given that he's an authority
on REST), and I've looked at this post a fair bit. For this project, all
factors involved would need to be considered, so I have not yet made a
decision on this.

> 4.) Will you provide a method to discover the JSON API's root URL?  Offering this will allow API clients to automatically find the API even if the API URL has been changed is a hook.

Absolutely. While it should be rare that the API URL gets changed,
discovery is an important part of this. This would allow, e.g., custom
domains to delegate the API to a central WP.com API endpoint.

(Also note that "wp-json" isn't a great relation here; non-registered
relations should be URLs. Likely, it'll be rel="alternate" with
type="..." as per above.)

> 5.) It appears you are implemented basic HTTP auth against a user account, correct?  Do you envision a class of API user that cannot be used to login to the website but can use the API?  What about API keys, or better yet both two-legged and three-legged OAuth 2.0 support?  

There's currently only Basic authentication as that's the bare minimum
that's needed. Anything past this would be handled by plugins (note the
json_check_authentication filter).

I'd like to implement OAuth 1.1 authentication in a plugin, as it's
pretty useful. I've also written code to do basically this before, which
is in production use at the moment:

https://github.com/rmccue/WordPressOAuthProvider

> 6.) Will the JSON api be disabled by default and require the admin to enable it?

As Bryan noted, this will start life in a plugin, so it will be opt-in.
Upon core integration, it will be enabled by default (similar to the
XML-RPC API) with the ability to disable it via a filter (note the
json_enabled filter).

I have considered it, but IMO it's outside of the scope of the project.

If anyone wants to achieve this functionality, registering a new
endpoint with the rewrite API and pointing it at the API class should
suffice.

Thanks! One plus of this project seems to be that quite a few people
want to mentor it, so we'll just have to see how it works out.

In any case, I definitely won't be writing the whole thing in isolation,
and I'll be soliciting feedback regularly.

> We also have a GitHub project called RESTian designed to allow mapping of specific API to enable creation of classes to access the specifics of the API that don't require the user to understand low level HTTP, for example[4]. It would be great to be able to release a RESTian-based API client for this API when the API itself is released.  We also recently wrote a JSON server[5] although it was not generic in order to meet to client's short timeline[6].

Agreed, the more implementations out there, the better. Once the API
stabilises and an initial client is written, I'll put out the call for
client developers to start playing with the API to ensure it's solidly
built.

> It would probably also be a really good idea to get someone really strong in security to co-mentor. I think it takes a special mind for security and this project could indeed create a big security problem if not carefully reviewed for security. (Not me, I'm not a security expert but maybe Jon Cave or Mark Jaquith.)

I've got a bit of experience dealing with security issues from SimplePie
and related projects, but I agree completely. I'd love to hear from Jon
or Mark whether they'd like to co-mentor this project (or act as just a
security-related overseer).

Thanks for the feedback!

Agreed.

What I'd absolutely love to do (and am part-way towards doing) is
separating the HTTP part of the API from the internal handlers.
Currently, no handler should need to access any of the superglobals nor
ever output anything, however headers are still handled in the handlers.

By ensuring a consistent API here, it means that e.g. a WooCommerce
endpoint could simply wrap around the existing method:

	function getProduct($id) {
		$data = WP_JSON_Server::getPost($id);
		$data->price = get_post_meta('_price', $id, true);
		return $data;
	}

Absolutely. There are indeed problems with this that will need to be
considered in depth to ensure that the API is always working with the
proper data.

Yep, this would be tentatively slated for 3.9 or 4.0 at the earliest,
IMO. (I'd envision the process would be similar to Automattic Widgets'
integration.)

I spoke to Dion briefly about this, and he noted that it's probably best
that I'm responsible for the vast majority of it. This would probably
mean that I act as the project overseer with sole commit access, with
patches very welcome. This is more of a process thing though.

Thanks for the feedback!

You are indeed correct, and "application/vnd.wordpress.api+json" would be more appropriate without an IANA registration.

In my discussion I was focused on the benefits of a WordPress-specific content type vs. generic JSON so was careless in the actual media type fact. The key point was that the establishment and usage of a WordPress-specific media type would have great value no matter what the actual characters were that were contained within the content type string.

Do you think this is a project that is insignificant enough that a single decider would be wise?  It would seem given the significance a JSON API would have on the platform of WordPress that a consensus of views would be a wise path?

> (Also note that "wp-json" isn't a great relation here; non-registered

Again, you are correct and I again was focused on the need not the specifics.  

This is likely the appropriate markup:

<link rel="alternate" type="application/vnd.wordpress.api+json" href="http://example.com/wp-json.php">

Yes, this is an area that's beyond end-user feature and is something that if done poorly or short-sightedly could result in a large opportunity lost but if done well could further expand what the WordPress platform is capable of, maybe even by an order of magnitude. 

As such, it's no wonder many people are interested.

One important part to keep in mind is that this API needs to balance the

example, the Range header would be a great way to specify how many posts
you want back from a collection (list of posts, e.g.). However, this is
problematic due to problems with misbehaving proxies in addition to
being harder in Javascript.

These types of concerns will certainly be taken into consideration and
I'll endeavour to discuss any large architectural decisions to ensure
that we come up with something that everyone is satisfied with.

Thanks!

I agree, but we also need to balance other concerns (such as browser
support for +json).

> Do you think this is a project that is insignificant enough that a single decider would be wise?  It would seem given the significance a JSON API would have on the platform of WordPress that a consensus of views would be a wise path?

Whereby "I have not yet made a decision" means "I haven't considered the
differing opinions in enough depth, nor have I considered views in the
WP community enough to make a consensus". This isn't a dictatorship, but
design by committee is a serious problem that needs to be considered.

Agreed, and that's why I've been soliciting feedback on this initial
proof-of-concept as well as this proposal, and will continue to do so
throughout the project (assuming it is accepted).

Thanks for the feedback!

Seeing this I have another concern and that is of implementing the getPost() method as static instead of as the instance method given the difficulty of correctly unit testing static methods[1].

I'm not very concerned about pragmatic choices being taken with full understanding of the issues but instead for abritrary choices made because they "seemed like the right way to do it at the time."

I was presuming that, like me, you are not perfect in your understanding of these issues nor, like me, that you have not had the same level of experience in these issues as the collective experience of those who frequent the equivalent list to this for web service issues.

Can you give an example (where a browser would support "application/json" and thus using "application/vnd.wordpress+json" would be a problem?)  I can't think of a specific one at the moment.

"Design by committee" is indeed a concern, but a bigger concern is "delivering an architecture in 2 months that needs longer to get right."  This is not a UI feature, this is an interoperability architecture.

A perfect example of schedule affecting architecture is the Menu system.  The core team focused on a delivery date for it instead of allowing it's architecture to be fully fleshed out before it was "baked in" to core, and many developers including myself have lamented the issues that the rushed design has caused.  Fortunately at least the menu system only affects WordPress core and its plugins and themes, not a potentially untold number of apps that might integrate with WordPress.

Frankly I'm starting to be very concerned that the timeframe allowed for a GSOC project would trump the calendar time required for discussions to achieve the best compromises in architecture.  I think this addition probably really needs to be a blessed Trac ticket where all that have interest are free to input and provide patches.  I fear if this is a GSOC project it will may result in an plugin that by nature will be blessed by the community but that will result in many unfortunate timeframe compromises that will only be recognized at problematic several years after the plugin's functionality gets incorporated into core.

Based on these discussions, and while it pains me I must reverse my earlier endorsement. I think it would be a mistake for WordPress and it's community if this were project were accepted for GSOC.  There are too many decisions that should be considered by more than a small number of eyes to allow a 2 month window to "bake in" it's architecture. 

A JSON API that can affect 70 million websites needs more time than 2 month to get right.

-Mike
P.S. Ryan: Please do not feel that I am attacking you in any way.  I have great respect for you. I'm instead focusing on what I think will be in the best interest of the WordPress community and WordPress as a platform. Clearly you should be heavily involved in this project, but I think it should be managed on Trac, not via GSOC.

Which is why it's not even being considered for merge to trunk during
(or for quite some time after) GSoC.

The API wouldn't be in lockdown for backwards incompatible changes
(hitting version 1.0 so-to-speak) until such a time that it's merged
into trunk. As such, anything and everything can go through proper
iteration and testing while it's still in the form of a plugin that's
easy to install, test, and play with, but not tempting clients to
build anything expecting a stable API. We can still discuss and make
changes as necessary for likely another year beyond the final GSoC
plugin.

On the contrary, GSoC is an excellent opportunity to get things
rolling on this, and to focus some attention on it, especially because
this is a project that never fit very well into the typical assigned
feature teams we've been organizing with every release (since it's a
project that requires time spanning multiple releases). So if not
during GSoC, any REST API implementation would likely actually have a
much harder time getting the attention and time it needs.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Closing the HTTP connection on wp-cron
Message-ID: <5167D8EE.1080302@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I author a backup plugin, and on one site I'm looking at, we've run into 
an issue with Cloudflare.

Basically, all scheduled backup plugins are using WordPress's scheduler, 
and by default this is using wp_remote_post to post to itself.

When the site is behind Cloudflare (which is just an enormous reverse 
proxy), Cloudflare times out after 30 seconds. This makes the the 
backups run a lot slower; or on really large sites which are 
resource-starved, makes them time out. On the particular one I'm looking 
at, 30 seconds is worth about 12 seconds on an average host. Not enough 
time for the backup engine to restart, scan through a big zip file to 
see what files are already in there, and then scan through more files to 
add, and actually add a new batch before Cloudflare kills the

Obviously the best solution is "don't have a really large site on 
resource-starved hosting". But, I'm trying to maximise the odds and want 
to see what more I can do.

The backup plugin doesn't need to send any output when it's doing a 
backup job via cron. There's nowhere for the output to go. So I think 
that I can just close the HTTP connection, when running via cron. So, 
questions:

1) Are there any obvious flaws in that scheme, or a better way to 
achieve the goal?

2) Is this the best way to do that? Google shows quite a lot of 
variations. I've done some HTTP-closing in the past, which has worked, 
and generally use the following - but is it missing anything?

   header("Content-Length: 0");
   header('Connection: close');
   flush();

Many thanks,

David

Ah. I now realise that the *real* problem is that the webserver that the 
site I'm investigating is on appears to be ignoring ignore_user_abort. 
ignore_user_abort already achieves, by design, what I'm trying to 
achieve, and I already call it - as does wp_cron. But my real problem is 
that provably, even with ignore_user_abort, PHP is dying from underneath me.

So, the real question I should be asking is - why is ignore_user_abort 
failing?

And, I believe I have an answer, because I had another guy with the same 
problem yesterday - he's running LiteSpeed.

LiteSpeed seems to have a generic problem with wp_cron. In case this 
information helps someone else in future, if you find that your cron 
jobs abort excessively early, then add this to .htaccess. This fixed it 
for the guy I had yesterday:

RewriteRule ^$ - [E=noabort:1]

Sure, but the testing in this case it's probably more likely that we'll
test over HTTP anyway.

And you are but one person.

Equivalently I've had probably 5x rodeo experience compare with yours, and I would not trust myself alone in a short timeframe with an API designed for 70 million.

I have been looking at this interaction since it started. Actually, I
am also interested in applying for the very same project and I
couldn't help but joining in the discussion.

I love the fact that WordPress put this project on the idea list
because as Ryan said before, "The idea of the GSoC project is to go
from what we have now (i.e. nothing) to something usable." This has
been the motive of most of the GSoC project undertaken by many
students till date and is definitely a good starting point. If
WordPress were to wait for deciding the perfect architecture for
making this API, then it will definitely take a long time. And if
Ryan, or I, or any student for that matter is able to work on API that
pretty much does what the current XML implementation does, then it is
definitely a huge success as we will have a basic foundation ready for
tackling more issues in the future.

And the way Ryan, has defined the basic version of the proposed JSON
API, it works in pretty much the same fashion other APIs do. I doubt
the fact that after a version change, the API will break. The basic
foundation can never change this much to break older applications.
Cheers!

I will repeat: Implementing a JSON API as a GSOC project is a BAD idea.  

To constrain the architecture decisions to 2 months minus the time required to fully implement is a BAD idea.  To effectively have one person with one mentor choose the architecture for a JSON API that could affect 70 millions sites is a BAD idea.

A GSOC JSON API will be treated as the defacto-standard JSON API implementation planned for WordPress core and thus more than a few people will use it. Implemented API code has great inertia. Architecture choices will quickly be "baked in" from usage and the cry to halt change in the API will be great, especially is someone influential with core builds to this API.

A JSON API has attributes that other GSOC projects will not have.  APIs are different from UX; people can adapt to a changing UX[1]; programs written to API cannot adapt unless someone devotes time or funds to modify them. 

Please do not do this; make it a Trac ticket instead. Organize a KickStarter campaign if it's about the money; I'll back it.

-Mike
P.S. Again, this is not personal. I have great respect for both you Bryan and Ryan and I hope my objection to this does not sour you on me personally. This is because I truly believe a JSON API is too important for the GSOC process.

It is not about waiting for the perfect architecture, it is about making sure that the proposed architecture will have the time to be properly vetted.

Open source is often championed because of "many eyes."  A GSOC JSON API will not gain that benefit until after the architecture has been "baked in."

I didn't read the whole story yet but please Mike this isn't helpful. I don't think that it is a bad idea. I think in two months we do get something done. Obviously not a full implemented JSON/RESTful API but that isn't needed at all. Also a Trac ticket doesn't help at all. You will get a lot of responses an opinions and it hard to filter it out. I do believe a small group can help out starting this idea.

Obviously 1 student and 1 mentor isn't really a group but there are other people that can help out. If I'm not a mentor on this idea I do help out and I'm sure a lot of other people like Bryan and Eric will do too and probably this will also includes you. So the code will get many eyes on it. I also think that someone like Max Cutler will look into it and after talks I had with him I'm sure he gives good feedback.

I never going to say no to something like this since if we are going to wait core to do something then we can wait a long long time.

A Trac ticket does not mean group development; but it does allow for "many eyes" and for the team building to hopefully at least acknowledge the concerns.

Respectfully I've not seen any of the people listed or you or Byran or Ryan on the rest-discuss list or the api-craft list; the two lists where people discuss best practices for web APIs (and a quick google confirms no participation.) These lists are where people who build web APIs congregate. Yet you are saying that this team can oversee the architecture for a JSON API in a few weeks that, once used by a few people will have it's architecture baked in?

Would the team at least commit to immediately joining the less pedantic of the two lists api-craft[1] and pass the proposed API by the members of the list to get their feedback on it's architecture?  If you'll collectively do that I'll demur.

Not sure what kind of point you want to make here but it doesn't sound good. Obviously the history of GSoC isn't good but we really should take the effort that more projects made them to core, the mobile apps or other projects. Also I find the tone of voice quite demeaning. A student can be more then capable to build such kind of API. And I'm sure Ryan is one of them. Yes support from lead developers is needed and that is something that also need to happen.

The point is that we have a proposal on the table which I'm raising concern over based on process.  I think a JSON API for WordPress has too many ramifications to be constrained to a single developer operating on a fixed 2 month timeframe.

That said, you and I need not continue to debate unless there are unstated perspectives to present. If you believe my input is an annoyance rather than a valuable perspective informed of experience then feel free to ignore it. I believe that would be a mistake but that's obvious just my opinion.

What follows is simply a response your insinuations that I would prefer to clear up.

You find offense where none was intended.  I never once wrote "student" in any of my replies; I deliberately was very careful not to bring formal education status into the discussion.  

If I did somehow imply a student was not capable can you please show me where I did in case I am unaware?

Taken together they strongly imply that Ryan's goal for the project is to create a JSON API for *core*.  Further, considering that /wp-json.php in the root is not a proper approach for a plugin further implies this proposal was intended for core.

If the goal of this GSOC project were to just create a JSON API in a plugin then I would have no objection to it but your comments seem to be inconsistent with Ryans and given he named you as mentor I assumed you to had discussed the intention. No?

> Obviously the history of GSoC isn't good but we really should take the effort that more projects made them to core, the mobile apps or other projects.

Yet here you are saying you want more GSOC projects in core. Isn't this contradictory?

Bottom line from me; a 2 month scope with a single developer and only a few mentors is the wrong process for a JSON API. It's too short a timeframe with too few people involved for something with the potential affect on WordPress that a proper JSON API could and should have.

Guys, this is exhausting. Mike, I think you being against this idea is clearly noted. Ryan's really good. Whenever the API gets built, he'll probably be at the forefront - main reason: he already showed up with a lot of good code. Whether it gets worked on in GSoC or Space Camp, who cares - he has given us a starting point that no one else really has.

Having read through this discussion with great interest (we've just taken out our WP JSON layer for mobile apps), I don't think it's exhausting at all. I think this is the sort of discussion we need to see more of. Far too often on this mailing list we see people basically agreeing and congratulating each other on thinking the same thing. Hearing Mike, Ryan, et all discuss the finer points of something like this in great details is enlightening to all. I've learnt so much! If you're not enlightened by it, or are exhausted by it, stop reading :)
While not a fan personally, I absolutely see the real value of having a JSON API layer for Wordpress. But, it's something that needs to be done right, complying with RESTful API best practices, in a completely scalable way - that also plays very nicely with Wordpress's... quirks :)
I've not read anything from Mike, or anyone else here, that suggests Ryan couldn't do this - I don't think anyone has questioned anyone else' technical ability; but just because one can build something doesn't mean one should. This type of API needs to be done right, and it needs to be well planned, and it needs to be well managed - and bluntly, thats not my experience of Automattic/WP in GSOC.
We've been here before remember, with BBXF.org. I'm sure you all do...
Great developers, and we have some *amazing* developers working on core, are not always great architects, testers, managers or mentors. We on this list have a tendency to think "smart person + loves wp + writes code = can do anything".
As a non-developer, or a failed developer as my business card says, allow me to put my project manager hat on (something we don't see around here very often): A student with no years of full-time professional experience with real-world examples of high-traffic non-blog client sites, has to architect an API with limited knowledge of RESTful API best practices, in 40 working days (including planning, testing etc), and it's then going to be rolled out to 17% of the internet* as the definitive JSON API layer for the world's most popular CMS = RISK MANAGEMENT HELL.

Honestly, if Andrew Nacin or Mark Jaquith were to tell me they were going to plan/architect/write/test/iterate/release that in 40 days I'd still run around saying "Danger Will Robinson, Danger".
It's not about the person in anyway, or about what needs to be done, or whether it's part of GSOC or not... it's the combination. The question should be - "is this a small, manageable, and stand-alone piece of work that can be planned/architected/developed/tested and iterated on then released with the time frame in a manageable way?". Thats what GSOC should be about, and frankly this piece of work fails that test. It's too big.
We didn't get into GSOC last year because we did this in 2008, 2009, and 2011. Lets start with something genuinely small, modular, and stand-alone. Something challenging, but doable from an architectural point of view in 40 working days by a student with a small amount of mentoring. Lets get this year right, and maybe next year go for something bigger. But lets not repeat the same mistakes that had us not accepted last year!

Just my two cents.

 I agree. Contentious (while respectful) debates can be *very*
enlightening. They force all sides to clearly state their positions, pros,
cons, etc., which gives us unwashed masses a better understanding of the
subject matter.

To my knowledge, this is also the first proposal with working code that
I've seen towards a JSON API.

That's correct, the eventual goal is core integration. But that doesn't
mean it has to be integrated into core to work, it merely means that it
will be designed around that fact.

As an example of something this affects, note that I have not prefixed
any filters with anything other than 'json_'. If the intention was for
this to live permanently as a plugin, I'd probably prefix it with
'rmccue_json_' or similar.

The wp-json.php is how it would be implemented in core and is a
proof-of-concept based on the existing xmlrpc.php file. There's nothing
to stop this being in a plugin though, and if you'd like, I can write
the part that would make it a fully fledged plugin. The only reason that
doesn't exist currently is that I didn't need it for local testing.

What I meant by this was that decisions won't be made lightly just
because they're the right way to do it, but rather will be fully
considered with input from anyone who wants to provide it.

I meant in terms of tone. Working with open source requires a fairly
thick skin.

Let me clear some things up:

1. I do have experience with working with high-traffic client sites,
although I am unable to disclose those. I've been working professionally
with WordPress for the past 2-3 years, and I've been working on
WP-related projects for at least the past 6.

2. My knowledge of REST isn't *that* limited, and I have a much deeper
understanding of the HTTP protocol (which is, after all, the core of
REST) than many on this list [0].

3. Core integration is something that would come after the project, not
as part of it. The project would be built around aiming for core
integration, but not with that as a goal during the GSoC time.

4. It's a little more than 40 working days:

	Now - May 3: Submission of application
	May 27: Acceptance
	May 27 - June 17: Getting up to speed with the mentoring project
	June 17 - July 29: Work phase
	July 29: Midterm evaluations
	July 29 - September 16: Work phase, part 2
	September 16 - 23: Final checking for bugs

I intend to use the time from now all the way through June 17 as
planning for the project. I'm pretty familiar with WordPress, so there's
no need to get up to speed on coding standards/etc.

That gives 65 days planning and 91 days working on the implementation.
That's about 42% of the year dedicated to this project.

5. No man is an island. I won't be working on this project in isolation,
nor would that be a good idea.

The working code is not the relevant point. If the need for code is the only hurdle to adoption I can take the code I have used for recent client projects and prepare something to propose in a few days.  But code is not the issue here.  The 2 month single developer constraint of the GSOC process is the issue.

BTW, this was submitted over two years ago, so yours is not the first code for a JSON API:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/

Anyway, I am saddened that my feedback has been taken as a challenge by you and as "not helpful" by Marko; I truly believe we'll all be better off if this provide is not green-lit for a 2 month timeline.

Yes I'm objecting to the JSON API as a GSOC project but here is what I would be very supportive of instead:  

1.) Gather a team of 2 other student developers and 3 WordPress community mentors.
2.) Create a KickStarter campaign to replace the GSOC funds. This will create same commitment to deliver as GSOC.
3.) Don't set an arbitrary limit of 2 months. 

4.) Create a Trac ticket to allow those in the community to discuss and comment.
5.) Prepare an architecture brief to present on the API Craft mailing list asking for feedback.
6.) Bring on at least one professional web API architect as a mentor. I would recommend any of these people (no idea if they will accept):

- Mark Nottingham
- Mike Admundsen
- Kevin Swiber
- Mike Kelley
- Glenn Block
- Brian Mulloy
- J?rn Wildt
- Jan Algermissen

7.) Plan to give enough time that all the concerns of those who participate in the discussion on Trac have been heard and that a majority agree with the compromise chosen (web APIs are nothing if not an best effort at a series of compromises.)

But if you and Marko do not find that 7-point plan a better approach than a GSOC project then would you at least do me the personal favor of #5?

No-one has even proposed what the project requirements and
deliverables would be for the end of the GSoC project, either from any
possible mentors or from Ryan (which would happen during the
application period). How can you know time is going to be an problem
without even knowing what the scope of the project is?

He's just here to discuss it as a possible project, and what everyone
thinks those requirements could possibly be, not to get shot down
before he's even written up the proposal.

For example, if the end goals were only a public API covering just
posts and post types (and not taxonomies, media, users, comments,
options, categories, tags, pages, menus, widgets or anything else you
can think of) with no requirements on OAuth 2.0, and only covering GET
endpoints (since POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE would be authenticated
endpoints), this is well within reach given the time constraint. In
fact, it's probably too little for a GSoC project really, especially
given what Ryan has already put together. Even that would get us
started and going somewhere though.

It all depends on what goals are set for the project, and those
haven't been laid out. I believe this is what Marko means by unhelpful
discussion.

So it would be really nice if everyone would stop speculating on *if*
a REST API project should be accepted for GSoC, and actually discuss
what *could* be possible as a GSoC project, and what you might like to
see out of such a project, assuming it was feasible and acceptable.

If Ryan's proposal appears to be a problem, there is a special period
of the GSoC program specifically reserved to work out those issues
before proposals are even accepted, but it's not right now (it's just
before and after the student application deadline). Also, that's for
the core team running the program to decide anyway.

Bryan Petty

Any API destined for core needs more time than GSOC, no matter how small you try to make the scope. So you are requesting that I stop objecting to the thing I am objecting to. 

But I am one person and one opinion. I'll not continue to debate the concern I've raised as long as it's acknowledged.  Feel free to move on and do what you will.

In order for a project to reach its second contributor, it must first have
one contributor. In order for a project to reach its third month, it must
be around for two months.

API development sometimes suffers from design by committee. It gets
over-engineered because there isn't a proper sense of priority, scope, and
direction. For the record, the menus system was the product of more than
six months of work ? including some time spent as a WooThemes project ? and
wasn't an example of schedule affecting architecture. It was an example of
architecture by committee. A large group of developers working to build
something with ill-defined scope and purpose (so much that an outside
project was brought in to provide a foundation and direction). Given those
parameters, we actually did a pretty good job. It wasn't an example of
under-engineering, it was an example of over-engineering. But I digress.

Saying that we shouldn't accept Ryan's proposal because two months isn't
enough time for an API "destined for core" is missing the point of
experimentation, of pursuing an idea, of trying something and seeing how
well it works. It also tramples a point Bryan has sought to make ? the
project's proposal, scope, and schedule have yet to be fully discussed or
decided.

We're not going to take an API that Ryan built in a cave in two months and
drop it into core. You're crazy if you think we're going to rush something
of this magnitude. Rather, the architecture he comes up with, and the
decisions he makes in consultation with his mentors and the lead
developers, will jumpstart discussions, serve as a starting point, and be
an impetus for there to eventually be a proper core API.

GSoC is actually the *perfect* venue for something so big as this. Have a
single contributor be paid to do a ton of research, draw up a first draft,
and be in a position to spearhead core development in this area ? it works,
and I have examples. Here are some previous Google Summer of Code projects
that had indelible impacts on WordPress, despite being one person + two
months.

***

In 2007, Dion Hulse did a project for a plugin upgrader. Early 2008, it
made its way into core and became a feature in 2.5. In 2008, Dion Hulse did
a project for a plugin installer. It, too, ended up in core, becoming a
feature in 2.7.

WordPress Core Developer Dion Hulse has since contributed the installer and
upgrader for themes, and the core upgrader. In the process, he also wrote
the Filesystem API, and largely shepherded the HTTP API.

In 2010, I proposed a new theme editor with revisions. It worked to some
extent, but was incredibly shaky mostly because our theme "API"
(get_themes() et al.) was insane. In 2012, as a core developer of WordPress
and using what I learned as a Summer of Code student, I rewrote the entire
API from scratch as WP_Theme. http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20103.

In 2009, Daryl Koopersmith attempted a WYSIWYG theme generator. Here's his
proposal: http://gsoc2009wp.wordpress.com/daryl-wysiwyg-theme-generator/.
Obviously something that would be great for core, and should not possibly
have been written by one guy in two months. Elastic Theme never left alpha
but it was a successful project because of what was learned.

The next year, Daryl Koopersmith proposed a visual CSS editor. (This was
jokingly considered Elastic Theme version 2.) It was a very ambitious
attempt that involved parsing out a CSS file and allowing it to be edited
on the fly, complete with a preview. (I'm over-simplifying ? this was an
incredibly tough project.) It too never left alpha but it was a successful
project because of what was learned.

In 2012, WordPress Core Developer Daryl Koopersmith created the WordPress
customizer, and it shipped with WordPress 3.4. (Dare I suggest this was
Elastic Theme version 3?) It continues to change the way themes are
previewed and modified. Just look at what WordPress.com shipped last week:
http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/customization-made-simple/. Without
his two GSoC projects, Daryl wouldn't have had the knowledge to create such
an ambitious feature, nor would he have become hooked on WordPress and
contributed a few dozen other features, nor would he have become one of the
best JavaScript developers out there. (I also would have never met him, and
he would have never served as my best man. But I digress.)

***

It's entirely possible that what Ryan architects is absolutely amazing.
Now, I couldn't speculate whether we'd accept a project like this from
someone who is unknown to the WordPress project, but that's not the case.
He's been contributing to WordPress longer than I have (despite being more
than a few years younger than me) and has a strong track record, including
managing SimplePie and writing his own HTTP library. He also attended the
WordPress Community Summit in October, where he participated in a number of
API and architecture conversations with other leading contributors. (It's
worth noting that if we didn't accept unknown developers who proposed
ambitious projects, this community would be without two of its smartest
developers, Dion and Daryl.)

It's also entirely possible that what Ryan architects gets scrapped ? but
not before we have five dozen decision points enumerated, one or more
design patterns written and tested, use cases researched, and plans drawn
up for how an API should be integrated into WordPress core. That's part of
the beauty of GSoC ? Ryan will have contributed to the project in a
worthwhile way, and will have moved this effort forward. If you think I'm
not going to support a proposal from a strong, well-known developer to do
something like this, no matter the "destiny" of the API, you're crazy.

Mike, you've raised your objection a few times now. Consider it noted.

Hi everyone!

I'm Boris and I'm studying at the Faculty of Computers Science and
Engineering in Skopje, Macedonia. Until now I have few plugins in the
 WordPress.org repository (http://profiles.wordpress.org/kuzmanov) and
currently I'm working on improving the one for Time.mk. Beside WordPress
development, I'm also one of the main people behind the Macedonian
WordPress Community and mk.wordpress.org.

For this year's Google Summer of Code, I would like to work on new fresh
design for email notifications for new users, comments, etc. and make them
more readable and optimized for every client or device they are opened.
 [Project: http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Enhanced_Emails]

E-mail notifications are sent when:
1. WordPress Installation
2. Comments post on your blog
3. Comments held for moderation
4. Forgotten password
5. New user registration

I've already made some schemes for all of the mails that are sent and this
is just my primary idea, so changed can be expected.
* This mail only contains the design for the 'desktop' version, but there
will be also for computer tablets and smartphones, normally, with the same
or similar design. The size of the content shown on the images will not be
the same, since this is just a scheme. I'll be working with HTML(5) and
CSS(3).

1) WordPress Installation
Here's my idea for the e-mail that users receive when they finish with the
installation. It's the standard content on the left side, and somewhere
(right side) in the e-mail I thought it will be good if they have some
quick links to the beginners stuff.

http://kuzmanov.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/WP_Welcome_reg_mail.png

2) Comments post on your blog
I'm also looking to make some improvements in the mails that users receive
when someone posts a comment on their blog. And instead of the links for
approving, moving to trash or marking the comment as spam, I thought it
would be great if there is some visualization for that, as the buttons
shown on the picture below.

http://kuzmanov.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/WP_New_Comment.png

3) Comments held for moderation
This is similar as the previous, but here in the bottom we have text for
informing the administrator how many comments are waiting to be moderated.

http://kuzmanov.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/WP_Comment_Mod.png

4 & 5) Forgotten password & New user registration
Since in these e-mails we only have user information and 1-2 links, the
design will be without sidebars and the content will stay the same as now.
Maybe there can be added some information for the date and time when the
request was made.

I'm looking forward for some feedback.

Thank You,
Boris Kuzmanov

Hello,

Myself Aagam Shah pursuing B.Tech. in ICT at
DA-IICT<http://www.daiict.ac.in/daiict/index.html>,India.I
am currently contributing in WordPress for Android.

I am thinking of implementing Contextual Action Bar in WP-Android. It will
really enhance the layout of the app and will be quite impressive.Moreover
it may solve some important bugs in its development phase. As per the
conversation with Dan Roundhill & Aerych, they really liked to implement
that idea as a GSOC Project ; as the app in all is not updated with newer
functions ...

I've created a rough idea proposal for the app
http://wp.me/p2FijX-u

Do give feedback for it..

P.S -This is just idea proposal and not actual proposal.

Thanks

Hi Boris,

I'd love for the default emails in WordPress to look better. That said, you
should have a look in the WordPress.org Plugin Repository as there are
several plugins that provide HTML emails for WordPress. WP Better Emails is
a popular one: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-better-emails/.

Message-ID: <CAGMh-MctVqp6SAUTFmGBdsY5T8ajVH2k6W-QunrFy7Ka2WD5aQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am an undergraduate student pursuing my B.Tech. in Computer Engineering
at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai, India. I would like to
contribute to Wordpress as a part of GSoC 2013.
I have worked on projects involving HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL
technologies.

I went through the ideas list of GSoC 2013 and creating a "New User Walk
Through" seemed interesting to me. I also, went through Mike Whitfield's
project and I think the walk through along with the progress bar can be
implemented with the user having an option to "skip" the step in which case
the default for that option is set. Besides, a "tour" like thing which
would guide a first time user through the process of making a blog and to
explain to the user what everything on the dashboard signifies. This, I
believe will make it a lot easier for a new user.
Please do tell me if I am following the desirable chain of thought. Also,
it'll be great if someone could point me to Mike Whitfield's project code
and other resources that'll help me start off.

Thanks,
Bhavi Jagwani

So while developing the first draft of the gsoc application, I had a few
questions.
The idea is: to develop a BB10 native application.
Some of these questions have risen as I am following the codex sample
application template.
1. This one got resolved on IRC with aerych :) :The current wordpress for
bb10 is an android port.
> so no native access to BB10 OS.

2. Will this app, after it has been developed, be part of core ?

3. What will be the scope of the app ? What should it be able to do ? The
final aim of the project.
Currently I was thinking that it should be able to :

   1. Post an article.
   2. Upload a picture.

Should being able to access your account be on the list ? Comments, stats ?
Account settings ?

4. About documenting the proposal on a wordpress powered site: my blog on
wordpress.com counts right ?
5. Will the project include all design elements of a mobile app ? It should.

Hello,

    My name is Dhritiman Hazarika and I am a bachelors student in the IT
discipline. I went through the ideas and found this above mentioned one
pretty interesting.

    Although i am new to the wordpress community, I have experience in FB
API (php/opengraph) so learning the Google + and dropbox api won't be a
problem.

   Among the mobile platforms i have experience in Android. I am going
through the docs and whatever i could lay my eyes on. I will go through the
wp android app code. Basically, i will try to incorporate the above feature
in the wp android client only.

   So, i would like some suggestions as to how i should go about working on
this idea.

Dhritiman Hazarika

Subject: [wp-hackers] Ideas for GSoC
Message-ID: <CACcxAnG17HwdsKW-odmWhY3Gjj0NWXUiRZECcUQikrADE=iKdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I'm interested in the GSoC and I'd like to be mentored by you guys.
I like some of the ideas in the GSoC over in wordpress site but I have some
ideas of my own too that I'd like to run by you before submiting my proyect
thing.

The first Idea is:

Public/Un-public
Sometimes you are writing something, but then you have to go, so you save
it as a draft; then you come back and continue your draft and post it. But
then you realize you wrote something you don't want everyone to see, so
your only option is copy the content and delete the post to write it
somewhere else. It would be really useful to have a big red/blue button to
publish your post or hide it if you don't want everybody to read it, maybe
you have a long post and you plan to post it in a specific date, so you
draft it but if you don't remember to post it then you may post it too
late, this post button may be programmed to warn you to post it or even
post it automatically via a Trigger or php.

Besides annother idea is create a social circle inside wordpress where you
can create a group for close friends who also public in your wordpress or
simply in wordpress.com. This is for the only pourpuse of leave post only
for users on a group. This groups are more important than the blogs you
follow, because you can get a really long feed from all the blogs you
follow and your friends posts get lost in the huge list that some times
becomes too long, didn't read (tl;dr). That adds some interesting features
to wordpress like  friends groups' feed on a list, friends on a group but
don't want their feed on the friends feed and a posibility to send a friend
a notification of a post if you know your friend will be interested with a
"tag" friend button instead of an email .

Well, it seems I pured some ideas in the last one, well, the next idea is
an implementation of the not public post. A lot of users use wordpress as a
content creation tool but sometimes they write a personal journal and don't
want to share all of it and it shouldn't be on the regular posts stream
because it about their personal life, how about a little journal inside
your admin panel. This journal would have tools to link to posts and have a
preview of the link and the ability to make a todo list. This tool would be
very good and useful to content creators that plan their posts or the ones
that are following the development of their site using a todo list to check
for things that they need, program post titles, program series of posts etc.

Apart from this I think the UUID for the users is very interesting as the
new user tour.

For the new UUID I would first add a column to the user apropriate table.
The new UUID would be made out of the username+timestamp from the epoch and
that string would be md5'ed. If you still want to keep working with
integers I would convert md5'ed string to it's equivalent integer value.
New users only have the new column value and 0 on the other to start
conversion. When the last user has been converted, the old id column would
be droped. Obviously before doing such a thing, a lot of precausions have
to be taken into acount as every function that has access to or need the
user id have to be "hacked" to verify the two numbers before each action is
taken. The resulting UUID of the users may conflict between on systems with
a large number of users as the new UUID can be the same as the old id of a
user on those systems. For that to be plausible there has to be extra steps
that migrate the users id to UUID in md5'ed strings only and then check the
result for converting the UUID to a integer equivalent if there is a user
with that id, if so, first convert that user to new UUID and delete the old
id. Do that check recursively so if that issue repets, firs check the user
down and so on. At the end of the "conversion" drop the extra column and
un-hack the functions that you previously hacked.

For the new user tour I think It would be better to have a meter but with
different levels, if you only want to create posts, a quick tour to show
you about creation of new posts, basic moderation, notifications, select a
theme, change password and where and how to read statistics. If you want a
more advanced tour click a button in each part of the admin tools telling
which does what and examples or tips to get a better experience.

I'm studying Computer Science Engeneering in M?xico, Michoac?n State and
have knolege on databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL mostly), networking
(Intermediate) and programming in C, C++(rusty in that), Java, PHP,
JavaScript (basic, JQuery), learning ruby/RoR.

If any of my ideas was interesting pleas let me know which to apply to the
GSoC with you guys, if not tel me if I can help with annother one of your
ideas.

Thanks for your time.

Apologies for the late reply.
@nacin ========Brother, I don't think the comparisons with previous year's GSOC is overly apt.The projects and people you mentioned all build features that could only be accessed from the admin area.The *RISK* if they were badly architected or insecure or buggy is/was limited.Given the current mass attack on Wordpress websites, I think it's not out with the realms of reason that some of us are concerned at something with a potentially huge impact on any/all WordPress sites is being proposed to be undertaken on a programme such as this.
As I said - it's not about WHO writes it. Ryan has been here longer than me, and is a much better developer than me (not that hard really). He's also a lovely fella who I enjoyed talking to about SimplePie and his other work at #wpcs. It's not a comment on Ryan - at all.
It's that a mini-project like this that has a far reaching impact with a potentially huge risk should not be undertaken to fit in with an arbitrary timescale decided upon by an independent external 3rd party. The merit of the proposal should be weighed up independent of the developer proposing it, as long as there is consensus that the developer is up to the challenge of the proposal should their be no external constraints.
Allow me to quote Kev's rule of Risk Management number #3: "Building a house on sand is still a bad idea even if you like the construction company".
(plus, and maybe it's just me, but isn't there a JSON API already available in jetpack http://jetpack.me/support/json-api/ via the already build REST API for WordPress http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/ )


@ Bryan========
> How can you know time is going to be an problem without even knowing what the scope of the project is?
Honestly? Years of project management.
Allow me to quote Kev's rule of Project Management number #3: "When someone says they want to build the Titanic in 3 weeks, you don't need to know how many lifeboats are in scope to know it ain't going to happen".


@Ryan=======
> That gives 65 days planning and 91 days working on the implementation.
I think this is a great example of the difference between a developer and a project manager.It is 91 days, you're right and I apologise. But actually, according to my calendar 91 days = 65 "working days".That is 65 working days if you do nothing but work on this every day. No school work, no day off, no client work, no family issues, no sick days, no days where the internet is down, no force majeure, no computer crashes, no days on simple pie, no holidays etc etc.

Thats why I'm able to come to a conclusion about it being too big.Because I already think you've over estimated how many days you have by 30% ;-)

Anyway, to each their own :)

Message-ID: <CAMq55cwbhh33X=jFBjCQh-72Ub63hnQO8giotauksQjhnD6ADg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, WordPress people,

For quite a while I've been mulling the idea of creating an API for
creating and processing forms in WordPress. After tossing around
different ideas, playing with APIs from other platforms, and a lot of
hacking, I've put together something I'm fairly happy with.

The code and documentation are on GitHub: https://github.com/jbrinley/wp-forms
And I have a general introduction/announcement at
http://xplus3.net/2013/04/14/wordpress-form-api/

At this point I could use feedback from other developers. What
features would you want to see? What major flaws can you find in the
overall architecture? Is it useful? Would you be interested in
incorporating it into your own plugins? Where is the documentation
unclear? Is anyone interested in contributing (code, documentation,
testing)?

Have a nice day,
Jonathan

Hello WP hackers

My name is Stan and I am interested in contributing to WordPress Android
app via GSoC. Having used the app for a little while I?ve spotted a couple
of things that could be improved in addition to already proposed ideas.


        - Re-implementation of registration without using a WebView. This
would improve performance, make it more responsive and would allow nicely
handle cases when internet connection suddenly disappeared.

       - Placeholder required for empty comments.

       - Improved offline mode. E.g. when I am posting without having
internet connection the notification saying ?Post Upload Failed: Sorry, an
error occurred while?.? pops up what in my view is not very user friendly.
Then in order to have the post published I need to wait for internet
connection to appear and publish it manually from Local Drafts (I can
easily forget about that). Basically things like posting, commenting could
be scheduled to be published automatically when internet connection is
available.

     - Improve media handling. Feedback on the Google Play Store contains
crashes (out of memory exceptions) and low performance when uploading pics,
videos etc.

     - Better push notifications. People reported on the Google Play Store
that the app lacks pushed notifications. Not entirely sure about that since
I haven?t been a very active user of android wp but sounds like another
opportunity for improvement.


Looking forward to hearing your feedback on things I have proposed. Also if
someone is interested in hearing more about myself and possibly GSoC
mentoring me, I would be more than happy to speak with you.


P.S. Seems my first email wasn't delivered (checked mailing list archives).
I'm very sorry if you are getting it twice.


Best regards,

Stan

Hello Jonathan,
I had reading about this project also on your blog - nice idea.
Currently I have reading the source, but no tests. But I think it is very
helpful and easier to maintenance in this separate classes.
Thanks for share this.
If I have tested your project and find changes, then I will use the github
repo for commits.

best
Frank

Subject: [wp-hackers] Limit Login Attempts
Message-ID: <CD748844.22CFC%chris@clwill.com>

I made a rather reasonable proposal, and received plenty of advice, but the proposal never was vetted.  Now the issue of brute force attacks has even received Matt's attention: http://ma.tt/2013/04/passwords-and-brute-force/

On the dozen or so WP sites I manage, wp-login.php is frequently among the top 10 most often accessed pages.  Yes, I have removed the admin account.  Yes, I have robust passwords.  Yes, I have plugins to help.  Yes, I am playing whack-a-mole and blocking the IPs one-by-one.  But brute force attempts to login are happening at an alarming rate.

Wordpress should include login attempt limiting as part of core:

 *   Logging into WP is a core feature
 *   Usernames and passwords are a core part of WP security
 *   Password strength metering is a core feature
 *   Limiting guesses is a key way to defend against brute force attacks

Is this the end-all-be-all to WP security?  No, of course not.

But much of WP security depends on not being able to get access to privileged accounts.  And limiting login attempts is a simple, straightforward, non-invasive way to dramatically improve that security.  It has almost no impact on the good guys and virtually eliminates a common exploit path.

Not every WP site allows comments, so having Akismet a plugin makes sense.  Many other other plugins make sense as plugins.  But logging into WP is an essential facility.

Limiting login attempts should be part of core.

If 90,000 unique IP addresses are attempting a brute-force attack, in which
no single IP address makes more than a handful of attempts, how effective
will it be to limit login attempts by IP address?

I would support the inclusion of Limit Login Attempts in core, based on its
utility; however, it won't do any particular good in dealing with the full
potential of the current attack.

Message-ID: <CD92B5CF.2CBE9%chris@clwill.com>

Because if you only allow each IP four (Five? Six?) login attempts per
day, you essentially stop them all.

In my log analysis, it's not the case that each IP only makes a few
attempts.  They try hundreds/thousands. Now they are hitting my block,
which requires a block of four attempts four times (16 total hits in a one
day period).

If you look at the analysis on this, it all says something like "at 1000
attempts/minute it takes only N days to crack your short password".  Well,
at 4 attempts/day, that number becomes millennia.

More to the point, why NOT do this?  It doesn't require everyone to change
their password.  It doesn?t require everyone to remove the "admin"
account. It doesn't require any changes at all, yet helps protect even the
most lax of password choosers.

I agree that Limit Login Attempts is useful, and does block single-IP
brute-force attacks. (I use, and love, Limit Login Attempts.)

But this particular botnet has demonstrated the ability to vary the IP
address used to brute-force a given site. That behavior, IIRC, has been
observed in the wild.

My caution in adding Limit Login Attempts to core in response to this
attack is that it would give a false sense of security, WRT both
brute-force login attempts and DDoS.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think there is a setting to make it IP
agnostic so if the wrong password is entered for the same username X times
it will lock down the account. If it wasn't Limit Login then it might have
been something else.

I agree that Core adoptions should not be made on the fly in a situation
like this.

Is there any way to set up a collective pool, a global 'limit login
attempts blacklist'?

I've been using something similar to what Jesse describes: limiting
attempts based on username so that I may disregard IP.  Does that overlook
something important?

Another option to consider would be adding a "Security" plugin to Jetpack 

This could be used to manage a centralized blacklist, as well as to patch security vulnerabilities as they pop up.  If all failed login attempts get reported back to Jetpack central, it could blacklist an IP for X minutes/hours after Y number of failed logins on any Jetpack-enabled site within Z minutes/hours.

Bruteforcing is the least of *my* concerns. I know my logins are secure.
The issue is in the hardware resources that these attempts hog up.

When they're hitting wp-login.php across many different installations in a
shared environment then that's an issue.

"Does that overlook something important?"

Well, unless you whitelist your own IP address to bypass the login lockout,
then if the brute-force attack attacks your actual username, you could find
yourself locked out of your own site.

Another solution is to .htaccess whitelist your own IP address for
wp-login.php, but that may not exactly be a low-maintenance solution
(dynamic IP addresses, logging in from multiple locations/IP
addresses/devices, etc.).

Just want to mention that my plugin, Theme My Login, allows you to limit 
login attempts and block wp-login.php.

The most effective way to limit issues is at the edge. Unique passwords 
will thwart the attack from getting in, but that doesn't account for 
resource handling. If you can limit the amount of traffic from ever 
getting to the box, you're in a better place. Find out what your host is 
doing to limit larger scale brute force attacks, that's your best bet.

First, let me be clear.  I'm not talking about the specific plugin "Limit
Login Attempts".  I'm talking about the concept.  How exactly it's
accomplished can be refined.

Second, as to a "false sense of security", the same can be said of car
door/ignition locks.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't have them and
people shouldn't use them.

Third, every single internet app I use that requires a username/password
does this.  My bank, every airline web site, and on and on.  It's just
basic username/password hygiene.

The only thing that makes sense to have in core is checking the password strength and not having the username 'admin' pre filled. Not that I think it helps much but it doesn't hurt.

Protecting against a DDOS attack depends on the type of attack. So locking down an account can be seen as stupid since it will lock you out when you want to blog.
But it can be useful like now for a short period. I however added an IP check now that allows me to login from home only. What also make sense for now and probably later add a role check in it.

I do block IP's but as said they can change easily. So it does work a little. That is also why I don't think limiting login attempts should be a core feature.
It just does too little when someone really wants to get in. if you got a password with 32 chars you are safe for now.

The most important thing to do is changing your password often, don't blog with an administrator user (finding out the username), update WP, plugins and theme and reading blogs about it.
The overreacting now on the username 'admin' and changing that doesn't improve your site much. It depends on what kind of password you have.

Also what everyone seems to forget is that protecting your server is maybe even more important. Most attempts on my server that I know about are trying to login to my SSH.
Another thing is that sites from clients that got hacked was not because of the site but that someone had a virus on their pc.

If anyone else is interested, this is what I'm doing to whitelist IPs in
apache.  The first allow is an example of an IP, and the second is higher
up in the IP block - this is useful for clients who's last number
frequently changes.

file: pre_virtualhost_global.conf

<Files wp-login.php>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 11.22.33.44
allow from 11.22.33
</Files>
<Location /wp-admin/>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from 11.22.33.44
allow from 11.22.33
</Location>

Great, except if your admins have variable IP addresses, or want to be
able to manage the site when on the road, or have some emergency and need
to get to the site from their phone, or ...

That's exactly what I do in my case. I actually wrote a plugin that puts 
'offending' IPs in that blacklist automatically ;)

Thanks, Dre.  My own, personal role in the WordPress ecosphere is to make
my code as secure as possible independent of hosting (and to do so assuming
the worst about hosting.)  But if you could easily steer me towards any
best practices re: what you are describing, I would be grateful to read it.


And thanks for that thought also, Chip.  I suppose one could have a
captcha-protected request-new-password-via-email routine that allowed new
login attempts, but I haven't implemented that yet.  Food for thought.  It
hasn't been a problem I've needed to deal with yet.  (In the case on my own
user account, I tend to have alternate access to the database itself, so I
could just manually unlock my account, but that wouldn't help other users.)

Yea, that's one disadvantage.  I'm working on a small script/interface so
that they can whitelist their own IPs.

With the present attacks, per-IP blocks are not necessarily effective, 
because the attackers have vast numbers of IPs.

The attack is distributed. So why shouldn't we build a distributed defence?

Produce a plugin that, before allowing login, verifies the connecting IP 
against a source in the cloud. All that's needed is someone to provide 
that source in the cloud. "Dear cloud - what do you think of that IP" 
"Well, that IP has had A failed logins on B different WordPress sites in 
C different countries in the last D minutes" (tweak accordingly to have 
a sensible algorithm, etc.).

That's a gap in the market for someone to earn some community credit, or 
money, from.

That's what cloudflare does. I'd suggest using cloudflare to most wordpress
installs out there.

For other reasons, cloudflare isn't a viable solution for my environment.

I wonder if Spamhaus's XBL - http://www.spamhaus.org/xbl/ - would help.

Does anyone have a sample list of IP addresses involved in the current 
attacks? Fancy checking them against the XBL? What percentage would be 
blocked if you deployed a plugin that blocks IP addresses on the XBL 
from logging in?

I'm very interested in doing this correctly and isn't quite my area of
expertise.  Are the people who are disagreeing with Chris Williams original
suggestion saying something to the effect of:  "WordPress is not the level
at which to be addressing this problem.  Brute force is a security problem
and a resource/performance problem.  The security problem is fairly easy to
solve without changes to core.  The resource/performance problem needs to
be solved before WordPress core ever gets loaded."  Is that a correct
understanding?

Jonathan,

The Forms API is amazing. If there are a few example implementations in the
code repo-itself that we can model our implementations off of that would be
great.

I just ran 10 IP addresses through the Spamhaus IP checker, and 6 of 
them were blocked by the XBL list, two by the CBL. Looking at my server 
logs, I've got a collection of 781 addresses collected in the past two 
weeks, and early 3,000 collected in the last 3 months. Mike

Determining password strength is a surprisingly difficult thing to do
properly. The current password strength indicator in core is kinda
lame. It's okay for me to say that, since I wrote it. :) It's just a
basic bit-strength check. Sort of the lowest end form of check. Not
perfect, but better than what we had before.

The underlying problem is that modern brute force attacks are built
based on the large lists of passwords that have been released over the
last few years, and so you can do much better than random with them by
using dictionary based attacks, since it's now know that most people
use dictionary based passwords.

Dropbox made a library a year ago to do better password checking (
https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/
) and I implemented it as a plugin yesterday (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/zxcvbn/ ), but if you'll notice,
this thing has 700k of dictionary in it. Way too big for core.

I don't have a solution, just a few references to help clarify the problems.

The solution is not to swat away the flies, but to dispose of the turd.

The cardinal weaknesses of WP historically arise from the 'well-known 
name' effect. So a *published* response to, for example, the 
wp-login.php brute-force problem, is doomed right off the bat. It can 
hardly be described as an unforeseen consequence.

The real success I've had in dealing with brute-forcing has been to 
block all requests for wp-login.php (inter alia) at the server level (in 
.htaccess) and substitute an alternate vector for that functionality - 
either over AJAX or by using an unguessable script filename. And I mean 
a filename that doesn't 'say on the tin what it does'. Yes, there's more 
but...

I also hate the way WP tosses its forms out like confetti to all and 
sundry, but I guess it has no choice out-of-the-box.

Since everyone seems to want to make the perfect the enemy of the good, I
have an alternative proposal.

When spam threatened the very existence of WP years ago, Automattic rose
to the occasion and created Akismet.  Between it and Bad Behavior, I see
essentially zero uncaught spam.  They did a great job, providing a
centralized solution against a decentralized attack vector, and it works
great.

In this case, what if each failed login attempt was logged (on
Automattic's servers like Akismet), and if more than X are seen in a given
time period (even a huge number like 25/day?) from ANY WP site that IP is
logged, and prevented from logging in on any WP site that participates in
the program.  Perhaps it is even added to generally available blacklists,
so that things like Bad Behavior can stop it earlier.  Sure, since it
phone's home, this would have to be a plugin so participation can be
voluntary, but within a few days, this bot would be killed.

As a community, I fail to believe our only defense against this is for
each of us to build our own TSA at our own WP site.  Especially by simply
using the power of millions of WP sites sharing information we can stop it
in its tracks.

I like the approach of the Login Security Solution plugin in the way it enforces strong passwords and attempts to track both IPs and logins then do blocking, delays, and password resets.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/login-security-solution/

This particular distributed attack is mostly probing the user name "admin". It would seem that if a user with that name does not exist (since it's no longer a default) then the attempt could instantly be treated in the way the Login Security Solution plugin does but without waiting for repeated attempts. The delays would at least slow the attempts looking for an "admin" user.

Delaying response times would lock up Apache processes that could be
used to serve other requests. It is likely to back fire on you.

Delaying response times would lock up Apache processes that could be
used to serve other requests. It is likely to back fire on you.

It would seem that if a user with that name does not exist (since it's no longer a default) then the attempt could instantly be treated in the way the Login Security Solution plugin does but without waiting for repeated attempts. The delays would at least slow the attempts looking for an "admin" user.

Agreed.  In fact, suspicious if the user doesn't exist all together. Could
be troublesome for some who accidentally enters in a username wrong, but
maybe there can be a way out of that use case.

Lots of people forget the username they chose for a site they infrequent and have to guess at what they chose. Would be a shame to make it even more difficult for them to login.

PHP has levenshtein() and similar_text() to calculate how closely 
related tow strings are to each other.

As a hosting provider, here's our take on things.. we'd love your feedback.

1. Having dictionary based passwords is a very good way to get in, these
bots can sometimes guess the right password on the first hit, if that
happens, a "brute force detector" is useless.

2. In theory, as a hosting provider, we would love a way to share the
offending ips across our sites and with other providers. Maintaining the
accuracy of this list is daunting, and something we're understaffed to do.

3. Blocking 90,000 ips is not feasible. Currently we're handling 250,000
connections/second. Each connection being pre-approved will kill our edge
devices. Now, compare that to Automattic, or the larger providers like
Hostgator/GoDaddy etc.. it's just something that's not feasible.

4. We don't use apache, so all these plugins that use .htaccess are useless
on our systems.


I personally think 2 factor authentication is where we need to move. It's
going to be a pain to educate the layman about it, but it is possible, and
we should. The websites we host at zippyKid are business websites, most of
these businesses deploy an alarm on premise, why they wouldn't or shouldn't
on their own website is beyond me. Trying to make WordPress login more
"secure" is pointless. We need to make more educated users.

Right now you can get confirmation from WordPress that an admin username
exists simply by going to the forgotten password screen. It will literally
tell you, if you don't have the right username, when you finally do, it
will confirm that an email has been sent.

That should be fixed

I tell clients, colleagues and students to employ best practices like:

   - never publishing content with a roll greater than author
   - admin usernames should be far more difficult than a typical username
   (ie. j4Friedman49)
   - passwords should be 10 characters long, uppercase, lowercase, numbers
   and characters

Those best practices, combined with functionality that simply presents
captcha based on too many attempts whether it is IP or username based will
fix everything.

Awesome Vid for your reaction. Hosting companies like yours does help to have insights in this kind of things.

I do like point 2 in a way. I did copy/paste the list from WP Engine and modify it to nginx rules. And 90.000 IP's doesn't work but blocking the top 50 does help.
For 3 it can be more feasible if you only do that for wp-login.php but I do get what you mean. It's a pain.

I'm not sure what the code is behind 2 factor authentication but it's doesn't seem feasible for the regular website's but yes on the bigger sites it is the way to go.

Wondering what the effects would be of after N general failed login

2-factor auth is neat and easy and anybody can set it up using the
Google Authenticator app on their own phone and this plugin right
here:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-authenticator/

You don't need a Google account, and the mobile app doesn't need
network access to work.

Right now you can get confirmation from WordPress that an admin username
exists simply by going to the forgotten password screen. It will literally
tell you, if you don't have the right username, when you finally do, it
will confirm that an email has been sent.

That should be fixed

I tell clients, colleagues and students to employ best practices like:

   - never publishing content with a roll greater than author
   - admin usernames should be far more difficult than a typical username
   (ie. j4Friedman49)
   - passwords should be 10 characters long, uppercase, lowercase, numbers
   and characters

Those best practices, combined with functionality that simply presents
captcha based on too many attempts whether it is IP or username based will
fix everything.

+1 , there's also Authy and Duo Security. WordPress.com already has google
authenticator 2 factor as an option. We're considering the same. I think
the password simplicity plus customer education is the key here.
As a community, we've done a great job of telling people about core
updates, we can do the same.

I belong to some id-theft SIGs and this is the same thing, we can't just
expect vendors to look out for us, or be responsible for us.

With my consumer hat on, I am completely ok with being responsible for my
own security.  I expect my hosting provider to provide me with the tools to
secure myself, and educate me on what is possible. If I choose to ignore
them, then that's on me.

With my business hat on, it's just nuts how simple people make their
passwords, and how complex things get when you try to do things to enhance
the customer's security. The subject of this thread is "limit login
attempts", is that really what we want?
Or do we want to limit unauthorized access?

Excellent points, Vid. This is an arms race. Anything core does might
change the nature of the race, but we will not stop it, and we will only
escalate it. That's not to say there aren't some good things core can do.
But, any kind of limiting is simply a non-starter, because it doesn't work.

Limiting by IP will not work against a botnet. This is a fairly primitive
attack, but it was still sophisticated enough to ensure that IPs were
constantly switched. Anything we do in core will be useless here.

My site was hit with about 50,000 login attempts by about the same number
of IPs. Why not do this? Because limiting by failed attempts will just
trigger a denial of service on two fronts. (One: The server will be
overwhelmed. Two: If you block by failed attempts, the user might not be
able to log in on their own.) While they won't gain access to the account,
it'll prevent the actual user from logging in, either. I'm understating
when I call this a terrible user experience.

Anything we do might end up with huge database entries documenting failed
attempts. Any brute force activity can hog CPU and database resources, lock
things up, and send things crashing.

Also: Usernames are not private information in WordPress. They've always
been public, and they're public on a host of web services. (Take, for
example, Twitter.) WordPress tries hard to balance security and the
experience of the user, which is why we do things like tell people when
their username is wrong. There are no plans to change that behavior. It
would do very little for security and would mostly just harm the user's
experience.

This isn't about perfect being the enemy of good. This is about not jumping
to implement things that are poorly understood and will likely only make
things worse.

There are a lot of ways for us to encourage (and even enforce) stronger
passwords. We should start there. If you have good ideas, check out:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21737. It's something a few of us
plan to prioritize for 3.7.

This is only true if you limit based on a silly low number of attempts.
If you make it so that any IP that makes, say 25 (50?) failed login
attempts (across all participating sites) is blocked from all
participating sites, there is no reasonable way to say this is a "terrible
user experience".  No one reasonably makes 25-50 attempts at their own
account.

Clearly Automattic has the power/resources/bandwidth to be able to handle
this.  The number of failed login attempts has to be a minute fraction of
the number of spam comments it filters today quite handily.

Talk about "terrible user experience".  Force me to have a password with
"at least one lower case, one capital, one digit, one symbol... Yadda ...
Yadda."  UGH!  That's a terrible user experience.  If I WANT to have a
crappy password, whose business is it but my own?  Warn me, maybe.  But
enforce is the opposite of a good user experience.

I'm glad we're discussing this, as Nacin said rushing to implementations is
a bad idea.

One thing I've realized is that it's unreasonable to think everyone has the
same definition of "reasonable" as me. All the hosters on the list can fill
days of WTF moments.  You also need to think about things like Roboforms
that some customers use on their own sites, for a valid purpose. Then the
"autofill/submit" feature of a lot of "password keepers"..

On a more practical note, doing something like this will require core to
put in a "state machine" for users, which is not trivial, plus you/we need
to think about how to support it. A user can be "disabled" for many
reasons, and what are the different states a user can have?

Then we get into the "authenticated v authorized" debate.. which is another
can of worms that we're not addressing right now.

The resources are allocated for spam, not to log activity like this. We've
had our databases grow with people using activity tracker plugins and
seeing individual sites add 100k rows per attempted user. While we've built
our systems to handle surges, we didn't and shouldn't build our systems to
handle relatively useless data like this. We have logs at the edge, there's
no need to store this info on a per site basis.

We shouldn't assume everyone has the same resources as Automattic. Core
functionality that logs login attempts sitting on a small cloud server is
going to destroy that server in about 3-4 seconds of an attack like this
weekend.

I think that's why the discussion is ongoing, I agree with you on
principle, if I want "password" as my password, it's nobody's business but
mine. The fact that, a warning and a rope to hang yourself with may be a
good idea here.

I have no idea what this has to do with this discussion.  I'm only talking
about FAILED login attempts.

I'm not, nor have I ever, advocated locking people out by the username
they attempt to log into.  I don't know how/where that got in this
discussion.

Let me be clear.  I'm not advocating a core change anymore.  I'm
advocating that Automattic allocate its vast resources towards a solution
of the problem of brute force login attempts.  And exposing that solution
via a plugin.  Just like they did against the spam problem years ago.

Again, I'm not sure you're understanding.  I'm advocating a system where
the plugin, upon submission of a login form, checks it against an
Automattic database.  If it comes back bad (e.g., this IP has made 25 bad
login attempts in the last 24 hours), it denies the login regardless of
the validity of the username/password pair.  If it comes back good, and
the local host determines that login is invalid, it submits that failure
to the database.  That's it.  Probably the same or even less overhead that
either side sees in the submission of a comment for analysis today.

Surely the number of logins to all WP sites cannot be anywhere near the
number of spam comments submitted to Akismet.  Even if it were, this
problem (unauthorized access to WP sites) is at least as much of a threat
to the health of the WP community as the spam problem was -- before
Automattic essentially solved it.

It's clear I was not understanding. This proposal is more interesting, and
something I'd like to help with. This is something I've thought about doing
in house as well, plus we had a discussion about this with Dre at the WP
Summit. With their cloud proxy, they'd definitely be in a good position to
have this information at a scale much greater than us.

Sending the ip address to a clearing house after the first failure would be
simple, with the wp_login_failed action.. what we do after that is up for
debate.

I don't have a ton of experience with the akismet API but I'll experiment

http://akismet.com/development/api/#comment-check

Obviously, we can't assume Automattic will take up the cause and do this,
but we can start small. :).

Definitely intriguing, something we'll need to put some more thought cycles
into.

What about splitting the dictionary out, compressing the file directly
via gzip, and serving that up via decompression script (assuming the
browser doesn't support native gzip)? Should reduce the size to
something manageable for core.

Based on this visual overview of the WP template hierarchy:

<http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy#Visual_Overview>

... all roads appear to lead to index.php.

Just curious, but has anyone built a theme, or knows of a free theme
in the wild, that has just one index.php file?

Based on this info:

<http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Basic_Templates>

... at a bare minimum, I'd need:

* style.css
* index.php

This got me thinking, couldn't I build a theme, one that accounted for
all of the various pages/views, using one index.php and several
template part includes?

I can envision an index.php template that utilizes a PHP switch
statement to load the needed template parts.

Seems plausible, though, I'd probably need the ability to say things like:

if (is_search_result_page) { ... }
if (is_archive_page) { ... }
if (is_XXXXXXX_page) { ... }

Now, I've definitely been in situations where I've tried to cram too
much into a single template, so I can see why this would not be a good
idea. Just mostly curious to know if others have tried this, and
whether or not they'd recommend giving it a try.

Thanks for listening!

Cheers,

What would you achieve with this?

This basically creates a harder to maintain, harder to edit, and just a 
pain of a project.

It's possible, and I've created themes that just use two files to create 
quick demos of plugins or code, but never an actual site.

If you're at the point where you're checking for is_xxxxx_page, you 
basically are replacing the template system.

Great points. Thanks folks, I appreciate the feedback.

This comment hit it home for me:

"If you're at the point where you're checking for is_xxxxx_page, you
basically are replacing the template system."

A part of me was thinking that using fewer, or just one, template(s),
but more conditional logic with sub-template includes, would be
(possibly) easier.

The feedback/help is uch appreciated Brad and Daniel! :)

Have a nice night.

Cheers,
Micky

<https://github.com/toscho/Toscho-s-Mini-Theme>

It has a comments.php too, to keep the code clean.

I made this for debugging. The theme doesn?t introduce any new function or  
variables. So when a plugin doesn?t do what it should on the front end I  
use this theme to be sure it is not a theme issue.

                    <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>"><?php

                <a href="#" class="more">More...</a>

It depends on how you use loops inside your page. How many loops do you
have in your page?
Are you using wp_reset_query() before opening the second loop inside your
page?

I' ve just started implementing html and this is my first loop. I am
watching tutorial series with Jeffrey Way and even as i follow step by step
we have a different result:). He's loop is displaying posts mine pages. I'm
stuck for 2 hours with that and I cant find the solution.
This is my only loop in index.php so far.

Hi everyone
I think I got attacked by some hacking because back couple of weeks I
receive almost hundreds of new registered users in my website
http://www.mondelio.org.

I found very strange that during a wend so many people have registered with
the same email domain: princeton-edu.com (which doesn't exist).

I am deleting all of them after I tried to contact some of them. What can a
registered user as a Subscriber can do to damage a WordPress site?

What can a WordPress Admin do to avoid bulk registration or prevent any
hacking to be happened?

I have installed the Back up plugin so I will make a Back up and I must say
FUCK the HACKER! The website is a NON profit organization that wants to
help poor young people in the world to study and get a better life.
Everyone should support and not attack but the someone is CRAP.

I apologize in advance...

http://www.sportswarehouse.co.uk/product_images/a/021/slazenger-abdominal-guard__41441_zoom.jpg

My 12 year-old inner-self LOL'd when I read "wangguard". I literally
laughed out loud. I have perma-grin as I'm typing this. I know, I
know...very sophomoric of me.

That being said, after clicking through the link and also visiting
http://wangguard.com, it seems like a cool plugin. Bookmarked it for later
testing.

Thanks for the heads-up (and lulz)!

This is not an uncommon line of thinking, but it is a very
programmer-oriented approach. Programmers understand if-statements and
conditionals just fine, and so this approach where they
don't-repeat-themselves in terms of duplicated code appeals to them.

The thing is that normal people are far more comfortable with having
separate files to do separate tasks, and have no problems with
repeating themselves. Endlessly, sometimes. Watch somebody who does a
lot of document or spreadsheet work on a regular basis and see how
they handle it. Lots of copy-pasta going on there.

In my opinion, themes should use separate template files whenever
possible, simply because separation of sections is easier to
understand for the non-programmer. It's easier to show somebody a site
in "parts" and then show them which files control which parts than to
have to try to explain PHP embedding in HTML, branching, conditional
logic, and all those concepts. And yes, end-users are the ones that
are going to be editing their themes, like it or not. If they want to
make minor customizations in wording, or layout, or they want to do
the latest SEO-trick-of-the-week, then they're eventually going to
want to screw with the HTML directly. Best to make that easier.

Also, consider child-themes. Much easier to do if you have lots of
separate templates.

So the issue here is it is unlikely for there to be a single IP that makes
that many attempts (to a single site). More and more, these guys are going
to use botnets and are going to carefully spread out their IPs. As Vid
points out, "reasonably" has a lot of nuance to it. You could have an
organization with a large WordPress install and 50 people accessing it, and
all use the same IP behind a router. Now suddenly if everyone screws up
their password once that day, you have a problem.

I'm not saying it couldn't help. It probably could. But it's an awful lot
of effort and setup time to *maybe* have some positive effect, and likely
to have known and unknown negative effects.

Sure, but individual servers don't. Imagine the number of HTTP requests a
server will still need to issue, not to mention the amount of data they
will need to store locally, if only temporarily. I don't speak for, or work
at, Automattic, but I doubt they'd see this as a idea worth pursuing,
unless it was just one more thing that VaultPress (or Jetpack, or Akismet)
took care of for you. But availability of local resources (during an
attack) and whether this would even make a difference makes me question it.
This isn't something that should be primarily done at the PHP level. This
needs to be done higher up the stack.

I do know that some folks at WordPress.com have been working on a lot of
password strengthening things over the last few months and that it was
written with the ability for it to be contributed back to core as early as
3.7. So that's good.

Not sure if you read the ticket, but it isn't about a set of password rules
like that. It was about detecting weak passwords from different angles -
names, birthdates, dictionary words, repeating numbers/letters,
insufficient length, etc. These aren't necessary enforcement rules, either.
We'd make sure the user is aware we've noticed that they have a terrible,
no good password.

No amount of global bot detection is going to solve the problem of the user
with the dictionary password. They're gonna get hacked sooner or later. And
neighborhood watch groups don't help when the bad guys can just walk up to
a house and into an unlocked door.

Under this nightmare scenario, the system administrator disables the
plugin and contacts Automattic for removal.

For each time the login form's submit button is pressed you get one small
back and forth to Automattic.  And one more for each failed attempt.
That's hardly a big load

IMHO it would be best, at this stage of such discussions, to dissociate the
proposed solution from any given entity who might implement it. Automattic
is a commercial endeavor independent from the WordPress project, and may or
may not want to take on the effort/burden of implementing a SaaS solution
to the brute-force attack problem. It is somewhat presumptuous to discuss a
solution provided by Automattic unless/until Automattic themselves indicate
a desire to develop such a service.

Also: Automattic has commercialized Akismet. While that's certainly within
their prerogative, it likely does not bode well for a critical security
solution. While several other anti-spam tools exist for WordPress users, it
is unlikely that the same will hold true for a solution such as the one
being discussed here.

What I am suggesting is a plugin, perhaps a part of JetPack, perhaps not.
And as such, it is not a part of the core WP project.

However, it requires an entity with the horsepower to be able to respond
to requests from millions of WP sites.  As such, it is beyond the scope of
essentially all WP plugin developers.  Except Automattic.  Perhaps others
exists, but I'm unaware of them.

Because unauthorized access to secure logins threatens the very health of
the entire WP ecosystem (just as spam did years ago), it is clearly in the
best interest of a company making their living on WP to address.

And note that this "separate but not" relationship of Automattic/Wordpress
is still imperfect.  Akismet is included in every WP download, no?

So, in general, is this proposal presumptuous?  I guess so.

Except, that's nearsighted. We're talking about a massive botnet with
hundreds of thousands of IP addresses, likely growing in size by the day,
with the attacks likely to grow in complexity over time ? and this is just
one botnet. This isn't just something you can stop, certainly not by a web
service. Maybe if every major (and minor) hosting company teamed up to
create a set of firewall rules that were constantly getting updated to
respond to evolving attacks, we could start to see some improvement. But
most of them are already doing this independently (and likely with some
collaboration), and it's still causing quite a bit of panic.

So, given these two facts:
 * The bot can succeed if you have a weak password
 * The bot can't succeed if you have a strong password

Should we put our efforts toward "trying to kill this bot", which given
that these massive and complex botnets are capable of disrupting the
Internet of entire countries is na?ve? Or should we try to "solve the idiot
user"? I'm going to go with helping the user as much as possible.

I firmly believe that leveraging the information gathered by 60+ million
WP sites can defend us against botnets that are a tiny fraction of that
size.  Just as it has for the issue of spam.

>So, given these two facts:

The definition of the term "strong" is just the foothold of an arms race.
How strong is strong enough?

Overall, it seems imbalanced that we would be advocating the changing of
literally hundreds of millions of username/password pairs by millions of
people as the solution to any problem.  We can't insure/enforce this in
any way.  Even with the changes you are advocating, what percentage of
users will follow suit?  10%?  20%?  That leaves literally tens of
millions of sites for the attackers.

But... A central service, with a view of this problem across the world,
can make a huge difference.

A 10 character password, assuming it is chosen completely randomly, is
sufficiently complex enough to be uncrackable by over-the-web brute
force techniques. 14 characters is sufficient if you're the paranoid
type. Many people with password managers use 20 characters, because
they no longer care what the passwords are.

The problem is that people are bad at choosing passwords. They use
words from dictionaries, with slight modifications. If they're given
rules like "use a capital letter, a symbol, and a number" then they'll
make it "Password1!" and think it's perfectly safe.

People-chosen passwords are often easy to crack using simplistic
dictionary-based attack patterns. This reduces the amount of hits you
have to make to guess it to be reasonable to do. If the password is
just random letters and numbers and such, like "9TKk!5F6S%" (generated
by my LastPass extension just now), then it's a large enough search
space to make it uncrackable within a reasonable timeframe.

It is perfectly possible to give users a better understanding that
their chosen password is awful at the time they choose it, and thus
encourage better password selection.

If you're looking for an external service to deal with this, like
Akismet for spam, you should have a closer look at cloudflare.com or
incapsula.com. 

Cloudflare is mostly CDN-oriented while Incapsula is more
security-focused: both deals with this kind of threats at the right
level, the DNS one.

They are a cheap/cloudy way to do what you should be doing in a
dedicated environment: put some filter/proxy/caching between your
webserver and the internet, and let it filter out the bad. 
Bonus:
Cloudflare is known for working with hosting and service providers to
support and debug their filtering.

That's it: both services leverages their network to identify and block
suspects and/or bad behaviours *before* they can reach WordPress, acting
on the external DNS level instead of taking actions from inside WP.

Hope it helps.

Ooh, cool! Starred the repo. :)

Thanks for sharing. I really appreciate it. I'm sure I'll be using

Hehe, that's an interesting observation!

I hate to admit it, but I've never really watched, or helped, someone
totally new to a blog/cms like Wordpress.

I do have a co-worker that's keen on creating more complex
spreadsheets though, so I'll have to look over his shoulder the next
time he's making one.

That's definitely a good reason to utilize the system that's already in place.

For the theme I'm currently working on, it's for my workplace and not
going to be for public consumption, just in-house.

With that said, I need to remind myself that I may not always be here
to maintain the code, and I know from experience that custom code can
be a burden to bear down the road depending on many factors (like if
WP considerably changes parts of its core system/API, or if someone
else ends up maintaining the code - I can't guarantee they'll have the
proper level of PHP knowledge to keep the site/multisite running
smoothly).

Especially, in the industry I'm in, resources and manpower are
limited, so I can't even guarantee there will be a web guy around to
keep things in shape.

Great points. Thank you for sharing! :)

Awesome, that's an area of theme dev that I have not explored much yet.

Thanks (to you, and everyone else who replied) for the pro advice, I
really appreciate it.

Have a nice day!

hi y'all,
I email you in relation with gsoc, If I missed the "door" - sorry, just
ignore this email. So, on irc wordpress-gsoc there aren't any movements at
all, some students try to ask smth but with no luck. I am interested in
"post by email" project. I have a couple of ideas about the implementation
and how it should work, for this I did a little research related to mailing
and also now I am learning as much as have the possibility about WP and
especially plugin development. I saw that Eric Mann is interested
in mentoring this idea, should I try to email him directly?

A little about me:
I'm 21, when gsoc will start I'll finish the third year at university, I
learn at IT specialty and about a half of courses are in English. I have an
experience of php for almost a year and about 20 - 40 hours a week. So I
use only php (of course with js, html, css) in my part time job. Also have
a little experience with WP, I worked with it for about a month developing
some custom functionality and a custom theme (both weren't meant to be
reusable), unfortunately I can't share a link because the site is a part of
a much bigger project and it won't be pubic in the nearest future.

The question is how big are my chances with the above set to work on "post
by email" or may be some other project?

Hey Luca,

There are a few people who answer question. Not sure what you name is on IRC and how you asked.
It does depend on that. I saw a few people saying they want to talk about GSoC without really asking a question.

I'm pretty sure Eric reads the mail so I guess he will react on this. Also as mentioned before I don't see any question to really answer.
So if you have questions please ask and I or someone else will try to answer it. If you feel ready to apply then please do that.

Marko

Subject: [wp-hackers]  GSoC 2013 : New user walkthrough
Message-ID: <CAM_49zWDOcdRGmWNL3qFmHM64t-T8aQDYmH_BdEcOmErKhpOug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm Pragun Bhutani, a final year Computer Science and Engineering student
from JIIT Noida. I like learning about UI/UX design and I'm really
interested in applying for GSoC through Wordpress this year.

I'd really like to work on building New User Walkthroughs to make it easier
for people to begin using Wordpress. I've been using WP myself for quite a
while and I've read through Mike Whitfield's 2010
project<http://gsoc2010.wordpress.com/mike-whitfield-setup-meter/>
about
the same. I think it'll be a good idea to implement contextual walkthroughs
in addition to Mike's plugin, in addition to giving it a UI overhaul.

These contextual walkthroughs can be enabled/disabled through the settings
tab and if enabled, they would show up on relevant pages, offering help on
how to begin with those topics. e.g. If someone opens the 'posts' tab,
they'll be met with a walkthrough which explains the process of writing and
publishing a post (something similar to how tutorial levels work in most
games).

As for the design, I'm inclined to implement something like Android's
startup walkthrough which places a translucent layer on top of the main UI
to explain the basic functions and options.

I'd like to get some ideas and feedback on the same and hopefully I'll be
able to develop the idea further and chalk down a rough proposal.

Thanks for reading!

I want to organize themes like this

wp-content/themes/themeshop/theme1
wp-content/themes/themeshop/theme2
wp-content/themes/themeshop/theme3

I couldn't find any information about such a directory structure being used
anywhere. Is this safe to use? I tried it and it seems to work for me as of
now.

Message-ID: <CA+mXE+8Bduu9oMm5du-1GtcH09eZow2zVogzFY=O3TKe6J6adw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

My name is Nadeem , and for this years Gsoc I would like to work on
developing the User experience when it comes to the editor side.
For example ,

   -I would like to make all the content updating and Addition of articles
and other things Ajax based.
 This is very essential. This is not only advanced but also faster. The
TinyMCE editor used is javascript based and it is possible to do this using
JQuery. Bootstrap alerts can be used to notify users about success or
failure of publishing updating etc.

  -Additional feature like smileys, embedded media from youtube and others
sites etc.
 This is a very important feature as people always want to share videos
online from youtube rather than store it on their host.

  -Font options like font-family and font-size
  Fonts of the present WordPress editor is fixed(to Tahoma which is
actually my personal favorite).We can let users to have control over this.

   -There are some resizability issues with the editor. This doesn't create
a good impression on the users.
 This will be little bit of css and bootstrap scaffolding. This too can be
tackled with some effort.

 There are many other features that can be added to this editor. The
WordPress editor forms a very important part of the users experience as any
detail of the website data management has to be done using it. So we must
take care that this editor gives its best when it comes to the user
experience and performance.

  I am new to WordPress and I have started submitting some patches so that
I can start getting used to the coding style being followed here. But  I
am running a bit bit slow as my End-Semester exams are going on. If I have
made any mistakes about any information above, please do correct me. Your
suggestions are always welcome.

Message-ID: <CANrO7TdSyOixP1XiArU_d8XtvVv64+yMSNW6ywX-F5k+kNih0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm Sayak Sarkar, a M.Sc. Computer Applications student from Symbiosis
International University, India. I've also been a successful GSoC'er from
last year having developed an Input Method for
m17n-db<https://github.com/sayak-sarkar/Disha>based systems.

I've been involved with quite a few FOSS organizations as a volunteer for
the past couple of years, the most prominent among these being Mozilla,
where among other things I've been conducting App Development workshops in
various colleges and universities in the region.

I'm interested in working on the "Port WordPress for webOS to Firefox
OS"project for porting the Wordpress WebOS app to Firefox OS, as this
is quite
an interesting project and also something that I feel I would really enjoy
working upon.

I've already gone through the source code of the WebOS app from the SVN
repository <https://webos.trac.wordpress.org/browser> and from what I see,
my understanding is that the project would require the following two major
tasks:-

   1. The webOS app was written using the Enyo.js 1.0 framework. This needs
   to be first updated to Enyo 2.2 framework <http://enyojs.com/> for
   porting the app to Firefox OS. [1]
   2. Given the fact that the webOS app was last updated almost a year ago
   [2], the app itself needs some rework to get it up-to-date and at par with
   the latest Wordpress mobile apps on other platforms like
Android<http://android.wordpress.org/>(the latest facelift for which
was shipped yesterday. [3])

Once the above mentioned tasks have been achieved, it should be fairly easy
to port the app to Firefox OS, and then successively to other Web based
mobile platforms.

It would be great if someone from this list can provide some further
insights into the requirements for this project, and how to go about it.

Also, it would be wonderful if someone from this list could help me get
acquainted with the pre-application task procedures for this project if any.

Message-ID: <8786A43F-9147-431C-8DC5-C2449A2160F3@a5d.org>

Just a quick question as my head is spinning ?

Client currently has a WP network installed at:
domain.com/main

Now, if I create more sites on this install they will come out as:
domain.com/main/site2
domain.com/main/site3

etc

What I actually need is:
domain.com/main
domain.com/site2
domain.com/site3

The 'root' has to stay as domain.com/main as that's how their host has set it up and they won't budge.
Confusion reigns and I can't see the wood for the trees and am sure I'm simply over thinking this and it's actually very easy to sort.

Suggestions as to how to achieve this please.

TIA.

It's fine to do so. The themes directory on WordPress.com is organized as a
series of subdirectories so we can separate free, premium, and internal
themes.

Hello Mark,

I am pretty sure the action 'wpmu_new_blog' is what you are looking for. This is what the docstring for the function 'wpmu_create_blog' says:

 * This function runs when a user self-registers a new site as well
 * as when a Super Admin creates a new site. Hook to 'wpmu_new_blog'
 * for events that should affect all new sites.

The action is called with the following parameters:

do_action( 'wpmu_new_blog', $blog_id, $user_id, $domain, $path, $site_id, $meta );

I often use http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks to find hooks that are not in the codex.

Best,
Matthias

Hello , I am student and I'm interested in the to work on the following
project.

Enhanced Emails

WordPress sends out a bunch of email notifications for new users, comments,
password resets, and more. Right now they're all plain-text -- let's bring
them into the 21st century with well-designed HTML + CSS that brings
additional functionality into the notifications, makes them more readable,
and is optimized and tested across common web mail clients, desktop mail
clients, and phones including iPhone, Android mail, and Blackberry.

Here is what I am planning to do , please give me some feedback to get a
better understanding. Also, I wanted  to mention that* I'm looking for a
mentor* for this specific project.

*Plan*

Basically I am planning to have email templates that accepts parameters and
then this will be sent them to users. Email templates could be html  pages
with css. I was thinking of basically have a php of the template and then a
function that prints the new email with all the parameters added to it such
as name of the user, the new comments or if password resets. *Well I didn?t
do a full research , however in my previous internship I used a library
that actually allows me to embedded special characters in any email file I
want to send and then using that library it will replace those characters
with whatever value I pass.*

seems like calling just: get_page_templates();

gets you a fatal Undeclared Function error. what's works is:
wp_get_theme()->get_page_templates()

if so, i should correct the above url.
but wanted to check w/ you Core Kids first.

Hello,
Myself Nitish, I am aspirant of GSOC 2013 and interested in wordpress. I
have worked with the themes sections of wordpress and have a fair
understanding of the code base.
I was going through the ideas list of wordpress and there is this idea for
"progress bar", I want to work on this idea.
I have the current developing code
base<http://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/> of
wordpress.
For developing Progress bar I have ideas:
1. Developing a function which will show the progress bar and hooking it
with all the required functions.
2. Developing a plugin itself.


It would be very helpful if anyone can guide me into this, and also what is
the pre-application requirement.

Hi I'm not an expert in WP, but so far I've been working with 
"Revolution Slider". It's a paid one, but is one of the best I know. You 
can download it form here: 
http://codecanyon.net/item/slider-revolution-responsive-wordpress-plugin/2751380

Every slider you create you can insert it in any part of your theme 
through a php snippet like this: <?php putRevSlider( "alias" ) ?>
It also has some conditionals built in for homepage, and specific page ID.

For me being a beginner with php and WP was pretty easy to use.
Hope you enjoy it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Sidebar video widget w/ its own sharing buttons?
Message-ID: <CADR_XNxU_68QiZv3YKh5z590CHyhxVNDiq_H7dXAQxkk_beeJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I think this is on-topic for this list. If not, my apologies and please
ignore.

I've produced a simple WordPress site for a client using a theme based on
the Genesis framework.

http://womenadvancenc.org

My client has a request which I'm pretty certain requires custom coding,
and I'm a PHP novice. Can anybody give me a sense of what it would take to
provide what she wants?

In the right sidebar, I've set her up with a plugin (Video Sidebar Widget)
which allows her to easily place a video in the space near the top. What
she wants is buttons just beneath the video allowing people to share the
video on their social-media accounts (probably 3-4 different soc media
platforms).

The sharing buttons embedded in almost all YouTube, Vimeo, etc. videos
aren't satisfactory for this client; she wants the buttons separate from
the video. The current video is not a publicly-shared one, so bad example
of this, but they plan to post lots of "viral videos" which will typically
be publicly-available and shareable.

Thanks very much in advance for any advice on this.
Best,
Patty Ayers

For Twitter you can easily generate the html code for a button on this
page: https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons#tweet
The content of the WordPress text widget is html-enabled, so just paste the
code there.

For Facebook it is a bit more complicated because you need an facebook app
to use their social plugins: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/
But you could still stylize your own share button which just trigger a
link: <a href=?http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://URL? title=?Share
on Facebook?>Facebook</a>
Same works for twitter: <a href=?
http://twitter.com/home?status=http://IHREURL? title=?Auf Twitter
weitersagen?>Twitter</a>

Alex, thank you very much. But I'm not sure I was clear. She wants to be
able to quickly drop a video into the Video Sidebar Widget, and have
sharing buttons automatically appear for that specific video, just below
it. The next day, she wants to drop another video in, and the sharing
buttons for that specific video will automatically appear, just below it.

I should also clarify - my own sense/guess is that this would require the
creation of a custom plugin which would be fairly complex and have a
significant cost. If this appears to be the case, I'm fine with telling my
client that.

Thanks again for any information or suggestions,

Patty

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSOC Idea: Mac Spotlight (or Google Instant) like
	feature for Wordpress
Message-ID: <CAPqx5puXPercFPnw4guAt6VDQgBLhN7UxLt3FseBPvSpUpa+vA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wanted to quickly bounce an idea off you people.

I've been using Wordpress for quite a while, I seem to install a lot of
plugins into my installation, I seem to be lost to find where the setting
pages are for every plugin. Before the jQuery Tab UI (pre 2.9?). I used to
Ctrl/Cmd + F to sort of figure out where they are. After that,  this trick
won't work.

I was thinking we maybe implement a Mac spotlight[1] like autosuggest
feature to find settings quickly. I was thinking of using Levenshtein
distance for the fuzzy matches and then maybe use Jaccard Index to rank
results (like Google Instant?). We could tightly integrate it with the
Settings API. That should help the user to find the specific setting they
are looking for. For eg: ("Feed" would bring up the relavant options like
no. of items, feedburner plugins etc).

I think a simple version can be implemented during the GSOC time period. It
has a lot of scope for optimisation with pre-caching, pre-fetching etc.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Page Navigation on WP List Table class instance?
Message-ID: <CAMg3evE-KyXhnQo6FcLiKKq4DQDH9XdSydO_1JuwEwySgMRmfw@mail.gmail.com>

I have implemented a child class of the WP List Table class (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_List_Table) to present some
post meta data I have attached to a custom post type I have defined.
 Everything works except the page navigation which I can't seem to resolve.

The page navigation yields a link like this:
http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?paged=2

What I need is something like this:
http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wpgform&page=wpgform-entry-log-page&paged=2

If I enter the second URL in my browser I get the second page of my table
as I would expect.  My question is - how can I set extra parameters such
that they are added to the page navigation URLs?

I tried adding arguments to the pagination args like this but it didn't
help:

        /* -- Register the pagination -- */
        $this->set_pagination_args( array(
            'total_items' => $totalitems[0]->count,
            'total_pages' => $totalpages,
            'per_page' => $per_page,
            'post_type' => WPGFORM_CPT_FORM,
            'page' => 'wpgform-entry-log-page'
        ) );
        //The pagination links are automatically built according to those
parameters

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Mike

Something like the share this plugin will work also.

ShareThis will share the content of a widget? My understanding is that
ShareThis and similar plugins share posts and pages, not media content
inside of widgets.

I haven't seen any plugins which allow the visitor to share the *current
content of a widget.* Are there?

Yeah it works, but Nacin once advised not to use it, because it was for core use only or something. Will try to find the trac ticket link. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Note that that post has nothing at all to do with the question at hand: the OP was asking about arranging themes in directories and Nacin's post is about putting template files in a subdirectory within a theme.

WordPress.com puts themes inside of subdirectories

/wp-content/themes/public
/wp-content/themes/premium

Etc.

It works reliably; no known issues I'm aware of.

What is the best way to set posts to display in two columns. I have design

Hi There,

Time for submitting Application for GSoC is about to come. And i am looking
forward to push my envelope further.
Since i don't want to leave any uncertainties from my side, i like to
consult wordpress mentor.
If any mentor is interested, please reply to make the idea possible and
successful.

    if(interested mentor)
    read : "my !dea"<http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2013-April/045668.html>
and please discuss, whether it is an interesting GSoC idea and where should
i focus more.

hoping for response.

FWIW, this thread inspired me to come up with a solution:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bruteprotect/

Failed login attempts get logged into a central repository, if any single IP fails to log in 10 times in 1 hour to ANY site or combination of sites with this plugin installed, it blocks any login attempts to any installed site from that IP for 1 hour.  Subsequent bans on that IP are held for longer (20 fails in 24 hours = a 4 hour ban, 30 fails in 48 hours = a 12 hour ban, etc).  The next update will allow a user to lift their ban once in a 24 hour period by completing a re-captcha. 

The idea being that, if we can get enough sites with the plugin installed, we can effectively neutralize the multiple-IP attack.

Obviously, this is not as ideal as complete host-level protection, but it's a whole lot easier...

Hello, I'm preparing for the google summer of code and I am
interested in the project named "Import/Export".

A short description of the project:
The existing importers/exporters use XML. This project would convert
these two plugins to use JSON for a leaner, less error-prone
import/export experience. Applicants should be familiar with the
import/export plugins and JSON.

Some related work:
I can not find a plugin that can export posts using JSON.
1.Exports and Reports, the most similar one I can find
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exports-and-reports/
This one can export the titles and authors using JSON.
2.Widget Settings Importer/Exporter
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-settings-importexport/
Allows you to export and import widgets settings.

The plugins like "Options Manager","Premise Settings
Transporter","Genesis Extra Settings Transporter" also can only export user
data partially, not as complete as the official one.

My plan:
1. Convert the official importer and exporter to use JSON.
2. Allow to export media elements. Images can be exported together
with posts and comments. The media elements like images will be saved
as separated files.
All these files and .json will be packed together into one ".7z" file.
3. Allow to import JSON file, with local attachment. In wordpress
3.5.1 users can only import attachments through URLs.

Am I on the right way? Do I miss some important related work.

Message-ID: <CAF4vWppUe23fFBdmgzvMRX=Jyz9uE9_LLWC84grxPmCtVoaLcA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I'm preparing for the google summer of code and I am
interesting in the project named "Import/Export".

A short description of the project:
The existing importers/exporters use XML. This project would convert
these two plugins to use JSON for a leaner, less error-prone
import/export experience. Applicants should be familiar with the
import/export plugins and JSON.

Some related work:
I can find a plugin can export posts use JSON.
1.Exports and Reports, the most similar one I can find
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exports-and-reports/
this one can export the titles and authors use JSON.
2.Widget Settings Importer/Exporter
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-settings-importexport/
Allows you to export and import widgets settings.
and the plugins like "Options Manager","Premise Settings
Transporter","Genesis Extra Settings Transporter" also can export user
data partially, not as complete as the official one.

My plan:
1. Convert the official importer and exporter to use JSON.
2. Allow to export media elements. Allow user export images together
with posts and comments. The images will be saved as separated files.
All these will be packed together.
3. Allow to import JSON file, with local attachment. In wordpress
3.5.1 users can only import attachment by URLs.

Am I on the right way? Or I missed some related work.

Hi Akshat,

Sorry we missed your post the first time around!

We're glad you're interested in participating with WordPress during 
GSoC, so I really hate to say that the Windows 8 app belongs to 
Automattic Inc., not the WordPress Foundation, and for that reason its 
really not available for a GSoC project. :(

Is there an other project you might like to pursue?

I think this sounds very interesting, and one thing you'll need to consider carefully is attachment file size. If a blog has thousands of images and the host being imported to (or exported from, for that matter) has very low memory limits, timeouts, or upload file size limits, you're going to run into difficulties.

Sam,

I'm curious if you've done any load testing with this?

Seems like it could (initially) make attacks impose a worse performance penalty due to the number of remote calls (and you'd be hammering your central server), not to mention the possibility of adding thousands of transients to the WP database (which could hammer a shared database server pretty hard)?

What happens if the API server fails (or takes a long time to respond) -- would I be able to log into my site?

What Daryl said with regards to attachment filesize.

Additionally, JSON is not some kind of Magic Bullet, and realistically
it is not any more descriptive than XML is or can be (in fact, the
truth is quite the other way around). Just converting to JSON doesn't
actually get you anything of real value.

Adding attachments and widget support and similar are worthy causes,
but converting to a JSON format instead of XML isn't necessarily a
pre-requisite for doing that.

re-sending this w/ more info.
i believe the Codex page for get_page_templates() has bad info:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_page_templates

before i correct it, i wanted to run it by this maillist.

following the Codex usage by calling: 
get_page_templates();
throws a fatal Undeclared Function error.

the Codex lists this function's source file as:
/wp-admin/includes/theme.php

calling any function in that file also throws same error.
in fact, i can't find any file in all WP core that loads: /wp-admin/includes/theme.php

there is another get_page_templates() in:
/wp-includes/class-wp-theme.php

it's a method of the WP_Theme class. and this call works just fine:
wp_get_theme()->get_page_templates();

b/c wp_get_theme() creates a new WP_Theme object:
/wp-includes/theme.php

so what i'd like to do in Codex is replace the error-throwing
usage, examples, and source file, with the above info.

before i do, wanted to make sure i wasn't overlooking anything.
thanks to anyone that can advise...

If he's only logging failed login attempts, I would think a) it wouldn't
harm you performing a valid login (since that wouldn't be logged), and b)
a delay in response to a failed login would be a good thing...  Slow those
puppies down.

Message-ID: <517670DF.1070800@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I've been doing some work for a client that has involved becoming very 
intimate with the internals of WP's widget handling.

One thing I can't discern from the code is this: There appear to be 
"multi-widgets" and "single widgets" - but wherein lies the real 
difference? i.e. Why internally are some widgets 'multi', and some 
'single'? I am getting the idea that a "multi-widget" is just a widget 
in a modern WP install, and a "single" widget is a piece of historical 
detritus.

Unfortunately when Googling these terms, there's too much "noise" - e.g. 
"single" comes up a lot in WordPress for other things.

Am I on the right track? Am I safe to pretend that 'single' widgets 
don't exist, if I'm coding for vaguely recent WP versions?

David

But it's not just logging them, it's waiting up to 15 seconds for an API response to see if that IP is blocked before allowing/denying login.

That means it's tying up a connection (or dozens if you're getting hit by many IPs at once) on your server which means those connections are not available for a legitimate user.

A sub-second response of "bad password" vs up to 15 seconds to ban an IP could quickly tie up a smaller server's connection pool (if the central server is getting hammered and responding slowly).

Not saying it'd happen, but without testing, this plugin could quickly take a shared server offline for hours during an attack. Hence my question as it it it had been tested under load before I go installing it across dozens of my sites.

If API calls were asynchronous (e.g. it simply pings the central server but then carries on as usual, and the central server pings back a blacklist response later (via a webhook, at a reasonable interval) to return all known bad IPs) that would seem to be much more performant (fewer HTTP connections at the expense of allowing a few password attempts through, which would be blocked by a strong password).

Yes, single widgets are legacy widgets (made before the Widgets API was available in 2.8, released in 2009).

If there are any left, I'm not sure you'd want to support them -- I'm sure they are marked as 'older than 2 years' in the plugin repo.

Hey everybody,
I just published a blog post with my Google Summer of Code proposal on my
blog: http://yrnxt.com/~121
I did not get any feedback on the list the first time I brought up the
idea. Hope to reach some more of you guys this time! I am planning to
officially apply on Google Melange in the next couple of days - just wanted
to maybe at least get some resonance.

I do not yet have any idea on who would be a good mentor for this project -
if it even is a possible project because not listed in the codex. Someone
with deep knowledge about the Widget API would be awesome!

Would be happy to see you in the comments below my proposal!

Hi,

I am Shivansh, pursuing Engineering at BITS Pilani, currently in my Final
year.

I am versed in Web Technologies focusing mainly UI, that include HTML5,
JavaScripts (jQuery, ExtJs), CSS.

I have worked in my college on several websites with the same knowledge. I
had also given a talk at the 3rd WikiConference held in Mumbai, India,
on "Improving
Wiki UI using AJAX &
jQuery<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Improving_the_Wiki_User_Interface_using_AJAX_%26_jQuery.pdf>"
& presented 4 ideas/projects with the Wiki community. The mockups of my
presentation and the ideas presented in it are
here<https://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/mockups/ajax-mockups/>
.

I also worked with the Scripps Research Institute on the project -
"BioGPS:JQuery-based
BioGPS gene-report layout
canvas<https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2012/shivansh/94002>"
- under
Mr. Ian Macleod, as part of GSoC 2012. (Sample
Code<https://bitbucket.org/Apoc/biogps_jquery>
)

My main aim in any project is improvement of User-Interface, so that the
end user is the one who is gains the most by the simplicity and
effectiveness of the project.

I browsed through the Ideas list, but couldnt find any jQuery based
project, as I searched through the tags in the accepted orgs list.
Kindly let me know if there is any UI project/idea with js/jquery/CSS
applicability that I may work on.

Thank you.

With Regards,
Shivansh

Subject: [wp-hackers] jQuery conflict in 3.6
Message-ID: <CAFnKAk3QzSRpYEPkXErk3LDXHksuMU4b-3JrosxQg5Cj73yKDA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I've been testing Wordpress 3.6, and I noticed a conflict with the
jQuery dialog css:

When you run this script from a wp-admin page such as the post-editing
page, the dialog is behinds its own shadow, and never lets you click
the close button:

var msg = '<div>hello</div>';
jQuery(msg).dialog({ draggable: false, resizable: false, modal: true });

The css that causes this is in
/wp-includes/css/jquery-ui-dialog.css?ver=3.6-beta1-24067:

.ui-widget-overlay {
z-index: 300001;


and

.ui-front {
z-index: 100;

Is this a bug in Wordpress or jQuery-ui? Or should I be giving a
special class to my dialogs and adjusting z-index accordingly?

Best regards,
Luke

Hi ,
This is Saleem Ahmed an student of Institute of Technology, Bilaspur.
I had this idea of Wordpress for Entrepreneurs . Basically the majority of
the people around the globe still treat Wordpress as a blogging platform,
because inherently it is and always shall be.

My idea was to come up with one single core update that keeps WP as it is
yet converts it into a CMS for entrepreneurs resource management.

Major companies across the globe use ERP systems like SAP while spending
billions on its annual upkeep.

So why not give them our own wordpress solution . i mean of course a person
with loads of wordpress experience can ofcourse develop the system but for
the general public it is not a viable option to use WP for such purposes.

The USP being its mobile version . All free of cost

I have been working on Wordpress since it was WP1.5 and do believe that i
could pull this off easily .

This is a sincere request to all the mentors out ther please do guide me if
I am in the right track and is this idea viable ?? Or should I just scrap
it and start working on the UUID Abstraction I had planned in the beginning.

Hope to hear from  someone soon.
Adios !

Saleem Ahmed

Hi Nick-- I've done some load testing, and it's hosted on a server that I can quickly scale up if need be.
 
> Seems like it could (initially) make attacks impose a worse performance penalty due to the number of remote calls (and you'd be hammering your central server), not to mention the possibility of adding thousands of transients to the WP database (which could hammer a shared database server pretty hard)?

This is an interesting question-- I have seen plugins add tens (or even hundreds) of thousands of rows to the DB.  Would it be preferable, from a best practices perspective, to use a separate table?  It seems like it would be more efficient, but not the "WordPress way"
 
> What happens if the API server fails (or takes a long time to respond) -- would I be able to log into my site?

Currently, when the API fails, the plugin allow login, however, keep in mind that once an IP is blocked, it is no longer necessary to check in against the remote server.  An upcoming update will integrate standalone functionality, so, if the API server is unreachable, we will add a CAPTCHA to login until the server comes back online.

Correct, API calls are only made:
The first time a given IP attempts to access your login page (we check to see if it's a known attacker, if not, the IP gets whitelisted and not re-checked until they have a failed login)
When a failed login attempt is made
When you visit the plugin settings page (it re-verifies your API key)

Hello,

I am interested to work on the Google Summer of Code Project "Enhanced
Emails" as mentioned on the Wordpress Gsoc '13 Ideas Page (
http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Enhanced_Emails). I have put my idea
and description in http://gsoc13.wordpress.com/ blog. It would be a great
help if any mentor could go through the description and guide me if I am
missing something OR if there is any further step that I should take.

Thankyou

I'm interested in playing with bruteprotect -- it sounds like a good
response to the various aspects to this problem.

One of our customer sites had a related problem today.  A brute-force
attacker can learn the names of any potential admin users by sending
GET requests for /?author=N where N is a user number.  We had one
attacker this morning who sent /?author=N requests for 1..10 and
identified an admin user.  The username had the word "admin" in it,
and the user's firstname was "Admin" -- not sure which of these it
keyed on, possibly both.  It then proceeded to try brute-forcing
passwords until the limit plugin blocked him.

Seems like multiple requests for /?author=N would indicate a potential
bad guy.  Not sure what is the appropriate place to add logic to respond
to that.  For now we're addressing it "out-of-band" with fail2ban
watching web server logs, but that's imperfect.

Mark

First, note that users without published posts will not get the
redirect from the ?author=N requests. Only published authors will. So
don't publish using admin credentials and this is mitigated.

On a wider note, however, usernames are not meant to be considered
private information, and efforts to hide or treat them as private are
misguided and potentially harmful. I realize that this is
counter-intuitive, so allow me to explain:

Let's consider the consequences if usernames were intended to be
"hidden" information. If the username was considered secret, then the
total attack-surface for brute forcing a password would increase,
because now the attacker must learn both the username and the password
to gain entry. Instinctively, one might think of this as a good thing,
but you have to factor in the human element as well.

For years and years and years, the tech community as a whole has tried
to drive home the point of "choose a good password". At least some
users have done this, and the point is well received. However, nobody
has ever really said "choose a hard-to-guess username too". It's not a
point to be driven home, and it's not intuitive. People tend to use
simple, alphabetic usernames. So from a security standpoint, treating
the username as "sensitive info" is problematic.

More to the point, if we assume the user has a good password to begin
with, then having an easy to find username doesn't really help the
attacker any. It's already basically impossible to brute force a
"good" password. Adding the username to it really is identical to
increasing the password length, but the problem is that people haven't
had "choose a hard username" drilled into them. So the username's
"difficulty" level isn't anywhere near what they're likely to pick for
a password. A username is, essentially, an extremely poor password,
given normal human behavior.

So, treating usernames as secret is a bad idea, because it adds user
confusion. If they already have a good password, then their username
doesn't really matter. Asking them to choose a difficult username too
adds complexity, and people are bad at complexity. If you increase the
security requirements too much, you end up with the "password on a
post-it note on the monitor" syndrome. You need to balance good advice
with how likely people are to actually take that advice.

Additionally, many modern webservices have eschewed usernames
entirely, in favor of email addresses. Google, Facebook, etc, these
have no user names at all. Finding out an email address is easy (you
can see mine in this email, after all). Does the fact that you know my
email address make it any easier for you to crack my GMail account?
I'm guessing not, because I have a good password (and I use 2-factor
auth, but that's beside the point).

Yes, the username can sometimes be gotten from an ?author=N method.
But it can be gotten in other ways too. And, it's irrelevant except in
a targeted attack, and that sort of attack is doomed to failure if the
password is a good one to begin with. Encourage good password
selection, and don't confuse users by encouraging extra and somewhate
unnecessary security measures as well.

That's my 2 cents.

I agree that obscurity isn't a correct approach to true safety.
Sometimes I still find it useful to add some obscurity to slow them
down a little.  Especially if it's easy to do and doesn't burden the
user (i.e. not making the admin username a meaningless string of
characters).

In my environment I can control the initial admin username and
initial password.  Unsophisticated users are unlikely to change the
admin username.  They're more likely to change the password, and
soemtimes they do it in a stupid way no matter how hard we try to
keep them from doing it.  Obscuring the username a bit keeps
them from becoming the lowest hanging fruit.

Anyway, in playing with the /?author=N requests, I found that it does
give up the login name even if that user has not authored any posts.
The HTML output contains:

<body class="archive author author-username author-2 custom-font-enabled single-author">

... where "username" is the name of author N.

Thanks,

Mark

Hello Everyone,
      I'm Kaiyi Zhang , a Computer Science and Engineering student from
Civil Aviation University of China. I heared the GSOC and I'm very
intersted in this,I look through manny projects Until I See the "New user
walkthrough", I think this is my determine.

      When I First use wordpress,I browser manny pages for the usage of the
wordpress,it's a bit difficult for a beginer. This project touches my heart
, Make the wordpress easy to more people; and I Believe I can take this. On
one hand I have learned HTML CSS JavaScript Sql and finished several
projects with this which can Compatible most browsers(except IE6,IE7).The
most import is that I'm insterested in this,Make the wordpress Better;

      I hava prepared a w ordpress on my PC,and I browser my sites for user

      1:Show users a guided tour of what is what on a page
       2:Show users a guided tour of what is next step
      3:Show users a guided tour of things We Want they do

Hi,

I'm Manikandan Saravanan - a sophomore student majoring in Computer
Engineering and Head of Ops at Underblu (we web technology startup).

I'm looking at the prospects of doing a project for Wordpress via Google
SoC 2013. I'm interested in the "Moving Wordpress" idea.

I've seen a couple of projects from past SoC events that aimed to do this
but I feel I can do a better job.

Basically, I want to implement this as a plugin with two options: moving
Wordpress to a new hosting account but using the same domain, moving
Wordpress to a different hosting account using a different domain name.

In the first case, I plan to do the migration using FTP and
exporting/importing the database.

In the second, since the existing domain will be active during the
migration, I intend to do this using a REST API that spits all the DB
contents in JSON - this data can be captured at the receiving end and
inserted into the DB (I need to tweak the serialized PHP a bit). In this
case, I also plan to handle authentication using a strong key that is
generated in the existing wordpress installation and entered in the
destination installation.

I'm excited about this idea and I need help from experts to validate and
plan. Looking forward to hearing from you guys.

	Usable
Message-ID: <CANUcbHv2ffmwQ_nsBNyKhm4RVsznp8DgF5n9+aTDp3Qi0LPSqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey WordPress team,

I'm Corey Alexander. I'm a CS major at Rose Hulman Institute of Technology.
I have been doing web work, mostly in WordPress, for the last 3 years or so
now. If you want to check out some of the projects I've worked on, I have
done most of my work as part of Mad Lab MG, and I have worked on almost
every project that is listed on the Mad Lab
Portfolio<http://www.madlabmg.com/portfolio/>
.

If this email is a duplicate, I apologize. Had a problem with sending to
the list from an email that wasn't subscribed so sending from my main one
this time.

Most of the rest of this email is going to be copied and only slightly
modified from the blog post I wrote on my application idea. If you want to
read it there, it is located at
http://coreyja.com/gsoc-2013-make-the-theme-and-plugin-editor-in-wordpress-usable/
.

Here is my idea:

The project I want to work on isn't one of the ones that is listed on the
ideas page, but is one that I have ran into when I've been developing in
WordPress quite a bit. Currently I hate doing any development, or even
reading code, using WordPress?s built in code editor. There are times when
I am helping someone else out quick and I can?t get FTP access, or just
have to fix something quick. In both of these cases I would like to be able
to use the built in editor. But currently the built in editor?s usability
is so low I do whatever I can to get FTP access and avoid this editor at
all costs.



Some of my biggest gripes with it currently are:

   - The tab key doesn?t work. Un-indented code is really ugly and harder
   to maintain.
   - Multiple browser tabs to look at multiple different files. A tabbed
   editor to have multiple files open at once would be a huge improvement.
   - Only can view files in the top level folder. Can?t edit CSS files in
   the CSS folder, or JS in the JS folder for example. So following good
   standards for code management leads to not being able to edit these files
   using the built in editor.



These are all things that I want to fix in the editor. This will make it
more usable and an actual tool, instead of the annoyance I currently view
it as. Besides these I also want to add some other features, most are
things that would make development easier, but aren?t as necessary as the
one?s I listed above.

   - Code Coloring. This is probably the most important of these features.
   Code coloring makes reading code orders of magnitude easier, and is
   something I would really love to see in the editor.
   - The bare minimum files that should be editable and highlighted are
   PHP, CSS and JS. It would be great if these could be expanded to
   CoffeeScript, LESS, SCSS and some of the other derived file types.
   - Ability to download a zip of the entire theme or plugin. Makes back up
   easier
   - Allow uploading of either individual file, or a big zip that would
   simply update the files that are currently there for that plugin or theme



I don?t have a timeline in mind yet for the development process, but I
wanted to get some feedback from the WordPress core team to see if there
you guys think this is a project that would work well for a GSoC project.
If so, is there someone who would like to be my mentor for it? Either leave
a comment on the blog page I linked above or shoot me and email at
corey at coreyja.com to give me some feedback on this project or chat about
it. Thanks everyone!

In the spirit of this thread i created a plugin too:

No api, no pissing about, just blocks.
Of course its never going to be as good as http server level block.

Message-ID: <CACo+17tuk5YGAk_6vLhOdksAK38vOgtxNqtbQddpEWvW3v7Tyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am interning at rtCamp that uses GlotPress to manage translations of its
projects here: http://rtcamp.com/translate/projects

I have explored the code and the functionality. I've also been through
BackPress.

I agree with the improvements that have been proposed in the GSOC project.

Additionally, the managers of the project often complain about the fact
that they can't see a list of contributors (and the amount of
contributions), so that they can credit the translators in releases.

Right now, they have to sift through all translations to see if they are
missing out on some contributors.

In addition, user management and roles lack a UI and an understandable
presentation.

So, I feel there should be some sort of user management that shows a user's
contributions to various projects. Conversely, each project should have a
list of contributors ranked by the %age of translations.

Also, to check the progress of translations and move translations from
Waiting to accepted, one has to keep visiting the site, since notifications
are absent.

So, there should be some notification at every 10% (20%, or some other
milestones) that should go to the admin and validators. Again setting these
roles for users must have a better UI.

Also, the process of adding new languages is very cumbersome. There should
be a way to add a default set of languages when the project is created.

The Google translate API 1.0 must be upgraded to 2.0 and the buttons
shouldn't show up if a user hasn't purchased the key. I'm not sure whether
the non-free nature of the API should be a deterrent. Firstly, the charges
are ridiculously low and second, Google collects money to thwart abuse of
the service rather than earning money from it.

There are many other things. However, we can't do too many things right at
the start. So, I'm looking to start improving this immensely useful project
one step at a time as part of my GSOC project.

Do let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks.

Hey  Alex,

I read the post and I don't get really what it solves. You still can lose the widgets but now it's an area. It only makes it a bit easier to move it back.
My personal opinion is that I don't see a good use case in core and for a plugin it's doesn't really going to work. The users who need it will not install it.

The reason why it's not a good use case is that it adds extra complexity that for the major users ins't needed.

Taxonomies have the ability to opt-in to a hierarchical URL with
$args['rewrite']['hierarchical'] = true. Post types do not. However, you
should be able to just use the filter post_type_link in
get_post_permalink() to change the generated URL. You might need to do an
additional filter in query.php, but I'm pretty sure things will just work.

Hey Faishal,


That are some valid points. Most of them are in my head but the problem with this all is a complete redo of the UI. It's something that will happen when there is time to do so.

Getting all translators of a language can be done or at least WordPress has something in place. Not sure what the code for that is.

User management is weird in the way you need to use a command line tool but to do only this is in my opinion is a GSoC by it's own.

Notifications was something I would like to see but because of other bugs didn't had the time to work it out. It would be an awesome addition.

Adding a default set of languages can be done from another project. No clue if it works like you want or if you having issues with it.

Google Translator API is a ticket for and will be worked on when other bugs will get fixed.



Mentioned really fast what I think it would be awesome if you can help out. At this moment it's a little bit only me with some contributions of others. Obviously people will look at the changesets for checking the code.

Excellent post, Otto.

There is one exception to this, as most here know.  The username "admin"
has been the de facto "super user" for WP for years.  Yes, I know that's
no longer the case.  But as I have found on my sites, this has lead to 99%
of the brute force attacks I'm seeing being against the "admin" username.
This is true on sites where admin has never posted, and even on those
where the admin account does not exist.

This is just to say, if you haven't removed the "admin" username, you're
probably asking for trouble.

What I used to do was to create a new user and give that admin rights then
restrict the rights on the admin account to the lowest available.  That way
if they did manage to hack into it then they only wasted their time.

Hey Marko,
thanks for the feedback! ;)

Menus work quitesimilar: If you switch the theme they need to be
reassigned. But when reassigning widgets at the moment you need to do it
one by one. My approach of not redoing the whole widget functionality is
all about not adding exta complexity.
Users who do not care about this functionality will still assign widgets
like they normally do but now will have a bonus when they change their
theme and won't get frustrated reassigning them one by one.

I think there is a target group for this. It is in the top ten of the
WordPress.org ideas. The idea proposes a interface as the one used for
menus. I think a menu-like interface would add complexity which is why I
ditched it.

Sure I cannot win you for this?
Alex

Hi Marko,

So could you help me out with a more reasonable plan of action
for submitting my proposal. at least  point me to the most urgently needed
features from your perspective. i  can probably add some of mine to them
and send a decent proposal. GlotPress  deserves at least a kick start. IMHO
most people find it more difficult to install than use. The usability
issues can be worked around but installation process i feel needs to
be revamped asap. Also, there are other members of my organisation  who
closely work with GlotPress and i can bring them around to contribute more
to the project outside GSOC.
So would it be feasible if i center my application around the installation
process.

Hey Faishal,

Yes, without a problem. I never really thought about the installation process since it's not really hard to do if you know how to edit the config file.
And I think the target group of GlotPress knows how to do that. It's not like a normal WordPress user will going to use GlotPress.

Personally I like the fuzzy string part but I guess its hard to implement something that works well. I don't mind really the tags.
Comments can be really useful but I guess we can then better go for an user management UI with as a side project showing per locale the people and who contributed.

Stuff like Google translate and progress notifications are to small and easy to fix.

If you have time on sunday to visit the IRC chat that would be awesome. I'm probably the whole day online in the IRC chat.

Marko

Hello,

I am Abhinav Gaur, 2nd year undergraduate from Birla Institute of
Technology & Science - Pilani. I am interested in doing project on
"Progress Bars" this with WordPress. I am thinking that it can be done
using jquery progress bar and PHP. I am having much experience with PHP and
JavaScript and also have good knowledge of WordPress. So, can someone guide
me how to proceed further for the proposal.

Regards,
Abhinav Gaur

Subject: [wp-hackers] Have I gone mad?
Message-ID: <517ACC05.1090102@wordshell.net>

Here's a great puzzle for someone...

I've had a bug report for one of my plugins 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/updraftplus). The bug reporter 
reports this message: "ABORT: Could not find the information on which 
entities to restore."

That comes from this code:

         if (!isset($_POST['updraft_restore']) || 
!is_array($_POST['updraft_restore'])) {
             echo '<p>'.__('ABORT: Could not find the information on 
which entities to restore.', 'updraftplus').'</p>';
             echo '<p>'.__('If making a request for support, please 
include this information:','updraftplus').'  : 
'.htmlspecialchars(serialize($_POST)).'</p>';
             return false;
         }

But here's the kicker; here's the included information:

a:3:{s:6:"action";s:15:"updraft_restore";s:16:"backup_timestamp";s:10:"1366984477";s:15:"updraft_restore";a:5{i:0;s:7:"plugins";i:1;s:6:"themes";i:2;s:7:"uploads";i:3;s:6:"others";i:4;s:2:"db";}}

And that, when unserialized, is:

Array (
     [action] => updraft_restore
     [backup_timestamp] => 1366984477
     [updraft_restore] => Array
         (
             [0] => plugins
             [1] => themes
             [2] => uploads
             [3] => others
             [4] => db
         )
)

So, $_POST['updraft_restore'] is set, and is an array... so how does the 
error condition trigger? Am I mad?

David

You're just experiencing some URL wrap in the email. I produced the 
unserialised output from that string:

$ php unserialize.php
a:3:{s:6:"action";s:15:"updraft_restore";s:16:"backup_timestamp";s:10:"1366984477";s:15:"updraft_restore";a:5:{i:0;s:7:"plugins";i:1;s:6:"themes";i:2;s:7:"uploads";i:3;s:6:"others";i:4;s:2:"db";}}
Array
(
     [action] => updraft_restore
     [backup_timestamp] => 1366984477
     [updraft_restore] => Array
         (
             [0] => plugins
             [1] => themes
             [2] => uploads
             [3] => others
             [4] => db
         )

)

Where unserialize.php is:

#!/usr/bin/php
<?php print_r(unserialize(fgets(STDIN))); ?>

Anyway, missing colons in serialised output copied in emails does not 
indicate how the error condition is triggered in the first place, which 
is the question!

Oh yes it does. Well beat me too it but your plugin looks really nice! I'll
have to use it next time I run into wanting to use the built in editor.
Thanks for letting me know though.

Hi Corey,

I think re-thinking the file editors are a great idea ? with a lot of
caveats :-)

   - The tab key doesn?t work. Un-indented code is really ugly and harder

We added simple tab key behavior back in 3.0 - works fine for me in Chrome.

   - Multiple browser tabs to look at multiple different files. A tabbed
>    editor to have multiple files open at once would be a huge improvement.

It depends on how much this would complicate the interface.

Agree. Again, the interface needs to be designed in such a way that a
large, hierarchical tree of files is not crazy.

Yes ? but, this is very easy to do and is not something that would take a
long time in GSoC.

LESS/SCSS is supported by WordPress.com, and I am pretty sure has since
shipped as part of Jetpack's Custom CSS module.

Not sure how useful either of these are. The latter is already possible as
a complete zip (via the plugin installer "Upload" tab).

Obviously, this has already been attempted previously ? to good success,
e.g. Advanced Code Editor as pointed out by someone else.

So, while this probably wouldn't work as a project, I would encourage you
to explore some other opportunities for improvement. There *is* a theme
revisions idea on there (it's actually a project I attempted a few years
ago, but it wasn't feasible with the existing theme API - which has since
been rewritten).

I would also read through this entire thread:
http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2013-January/045142.html.

If you have a different proposal you'd like us to consider, I would
strongly recommend it! There may be something on the ideas page that jumps
out at you, or there may be something else you have in mind. I like your
thought process in your proposal here, and would like to see an application
from you.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2013: UUID Abstraction
Message-ID: <CAE--CAVGEB9nmf_JnBqvdwm4nUssbubAZd1TuccU8g9KtZZL0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I'm Aniket (http://www.aniketpant.com), a third year undergraduate
pursuing Mechanical Engineering at BITS Pilani - Goa Campus. I started
web development with Codeigniter and after sometime picked up
WordPress for developing small applications, themes and plugins. I
have also spoken at two WordCamps in India, once on theme development
and the other time on using metaboxes effectively.

I planned to apply for GSoC 2012, but WordPress wasn't selected as a
mentoring organization and I ended up getting busy during the summer
with an internship. This year, while going through the ideas list, I
was happy to see some of the old ideas back. In the last two weeks, I
have opened some tickets and wrote a patch. Just trying to get the
hang of the way WordPress development functions.

I was planning to work towards Import/Export operations but my current
understanding of the JSON based output is not sound. Somehow, I missed
out on the UUID Abstraction Project while going through the list
earlier and saw it sometime back. Just wanted to share my understand
of the project and get some feedback on it.

## The basic idea

This project is interesting because it is one of those projects which
can actually go into the release cycle if the work is done right and
the end result doesn't hamper any of the existing code. On reading
through the data available on UUIDs, a number of variants are
available. I feel that v5 which uses a SHA-1 hash is a suitable choice
even from the security point of view. A v5 UUID is generated by
providing a namespace and a name. Given the same name and the
namespace, the generated output will be the same.

## How UUIDs can be generated?

I searched around the net and found this -
https://gist.github.com/dahnielson/508447. The mentioned file contains
functions for generating v3, v4, v5 UUIDs.

## What namespace can be used?

The namespace can be any of the following -
- A unique string provided by the user during install/setup
- The website name (but this can be similar in case of two websites,
not sure if it will affect anything in any case)
- A fixed/common UUID for all installations (not sure if this is a
really good idea)
- A random UUID created via a v4 UUID generator

This can be converted to a UUID as the namespace needs to be another UUID.

## Change in the user table

A new column for UUID will be introduced where the username will be
used as the name for generating the UUID. Since the username is a
mandatory field, it will always be present.

namespace + username = User UUID

## Change in the posts table

This table already contains a GUID which is in the form of a URL. It
is unique, but for consistency it is logical to implement a UUID in
this scenario. Similarly over here, the name provided for generating
the UUID can be provided as the post title.

Removal of GUID will not make sense because it is used all over the
software for generating the URL in many places. Instead the field can
be modified and updated to use UUID in it's place.

## How the changes will be carried out?

A tool can be introduced to do this. It will run all user and post
entries through it and generate UUIDs for them.

This is what I have been able to think so far. I would really love to
get some insights for my approach and what I might be planning
incorrectly.

Cheers!

Aniket

I solved it. It is not the main style.css, but other style.css in folder
that is used for navigation and sidebar stylesheet. What I done is copy
paste css from firebug and put it in that css file and it worked. Chrome
was giving me the error on that css file but after this everything was ok.
I dont know whay, and I quess I will never find out:)

Hi Alex

I didn't realize till now that my idea was in the top ten on that board ;).

I'd love to help you with this, though I am by no means a Widget API
expert. However, if you need help (mentorship) from a Product Definition,
UI or Vision standpoint I'd be happy to help.

I really hope this goes well, as I've wanted this functionality for a
while.

Jesse

Hey Jesse,
didn't know you were available as mentor. Would have pinged you directly.
My approach is a little bit different to yours because I did not want to
overhaul the whole widgets.php. On one hand due to not confusing old users
and on the other hand I do not think that a complete rehaul would be likely
to get approved.

Daniel already gave feedback to the proposal on my blog. Maybe you could
give me your input as well? http://yrnxt.com/~121


While I really would like to work on widget collections I am running low on
time and am thinking about proposing a second project, this time taken from
the GSOC ideas list and maybe more straight forward to get approved..

Subject: [wp-hackers] [GSoC 2013]: Queries regarding GSoC application
	template
Message-ID: <CANrO7TfhafZzSdip2L4jm4MSFnQ2NB-85QnFjEm+77UBtTiV+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had a couple of queries regarding the application template for GSoC
regarding some of the fields required in the Academic Experience Section.

Is it mandatory to include the details of one or more Science Professors in
the reference subsection? The main reason for this query is that there have
been a few faculty changes in my college recently, and the college does not
provide contact information for ex-faculty due to some staff policies.

The second query is whether I should enlist only the programming courses
and their grades in the Academic Performance subsection or should I enlist
only the details for only the courses relevant to my project proposal. This
is because we have had quite a significant number of programming courses in
our program curriculum and not all courses are of much relevance to my
project proposal.

Regards,
Sayak

Hello eveyone,

I am Pankaj Kumar from India, I am third year undergrad (Computer Science
and Engineering) student at Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I am
planning to apply for GSoC under Wordpress this year.
I am interested in:

   - Import/Export
   - Enhanced Emails
   - Move Wordpress

projects and would be applying for one of them. Please post if you have any
comment or feedback regarding them.

In the next few days I plan to fix some bug and submit patches.

Thank you

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2013 (Attempt Two!): Theme Revisions
Message-ID: <CANUcbHu2x6B2ECjHxKuZyk-hOtJO3FX35MEosZUzV1uZNmpdPg@mail.gmail.com>

Here is my second idea for a GSoC project. Again, this is basically a copy
of my blog post. If you would rather read it there, or read my other post
about my first idea you can check both of the posts out on coreyja.com. I
am thinking about taking the theme versions idea and doing that, but with
the twist of using git to do the actual versioning and let developers have
access to the power of git baked into WordPress.

Here are some of the things I am thinking about for this project.


   - Adding git functionality to each theme, so that a full history of the
   theme and changes can be viewed.
   - Ability to either push commits to your WordPress install and/or the
   ability to pull commits from GitHub (or any git repo) from the WordPress
   admin dashboard
   - Built in history page, with a difference viewer and the ability to
   revert back to any revision from this page.
   - Either creating a commit for every save made in the built in editor,
   or having the option to explicitly commit changes after changes have been
   made through the editor.


To expand on some of the details I had in mind for creating commits through
WordPress, I was thinking about have two or three different modes
selectable through the settings page. The first setting for be for the
?beginner? WordPress users, and would most likely be the default setting.
This would be for people who don?t know anything about git and just want to
have access to their revisions in the WordPress dashboard. For this setting
every save in the built in editor would be equal one commit. A second
option, for those familiar with git and wanting to use it would be able to
bundle multiple changes from the built in editor to a single commit. This
would require the user explicitly saying when they would like to make a
commit, and would allow for the ability to add a commit message. This mode
would also enable the push/pull functionalities. So a developer could push
any changes that were committed through WordPress to their central repo.
And also in reverse pull any changes made elsewhere from the central repo.
This would allow developers to integrate git into their workflow very
easily and while using current git best practices.


Also in any setting option it would be necessary to have some sort of cron
job, or something similar, to watch for file changes made directly to the
FTP and add commits for those as well. This could also be done with an
explicit option as well, but I think there should be some sort of system
for doing it automatically, for those users who just want versioning to
work without any added effort.


As before, shoot me an email, reply to this chain or leave a comment on my
blog if you have any comments or suggestions!  Thanks everyone for reading
and helping me out!

Message-ID: <CAF4vWpp=KLJeCNmtGBqxEPz5uHG5jpgb3uBpgxgV_2Cot0Si=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, hackers!
My name is yicheng zhao, this is my proposal: http://walkbird.1kapp.com/?p=9
My proposal is about a plugin that allows WeChat users to interact
with wordpress blog.

I paste part of my proposal here.

***Background***

WeChat is a mobile phone text and voice messaging communication
service developed by Tencent in China. It started in Jan 2011. By 2013
Jan 14th, WeChat has reached 300 millions users.

Over past two years, WeChat has developed many new features, including
WeChat admin platform, which users can use to promote their company
events/products/websites.

If the blog writer can make his/her post available in WeChat, this
blog will be more competitive.

***Plugin Functions***

Allow WeChat user to search posts by tag/category/keyword/author/date
Do a survey or vote via WeChat admin platform
Comment to a post

am I on the right way?

We'd like to be able to talk with someone who can vouch for your abilities.
If there is a professor, advisor, supervisor, etc., who can do that, a
reference certainly can't hurt your application.

We want to see what kind of student you are. If you're a computer science
student (which is by no means a requirement), I would list your programming
courses, not just what is particular to your project proposal. While you
won't use Haskell in your project, that you did well in functional
programming is useful.

I personally do not highly value strong academic performance when reviewing
applications. I will look at it, but I am more interested in your proposal
? not just the idea, but how you think and how you plan to get things done.
GSoC is considered a full-time job and we want to make sure we are not
making a "bad" hire.

Hi Pankaj,

In order for us to give you feedback, you should write up and send a
proposal (that you would submit as part of your application). We would like
to see what *you* propose for these broad topics, not just what others
think about them generally.

Also, WordPress is spelled with a capital P. We get a number of
applications from students who apply to many, many organizations and would
like your familiarity with WordPress to at least be spelling the name right.

Yeah I understand that, I have been an applicant to GSoC in past years
also. I actually meant if there are some specific issues with any of the
projects such any of the project not taking any more application or things
like that, because I joined in a little late so have less idea about the
progress of these projects till now.

What are the options for modifying and possibly replacing the the query
object after the pre_get_posts filter, but before sending final HTTP
headers and rendering the page? Would the wp or template_redirect hooks be
appropriate for this type of thing? I'd like to do some checking against
the query object and possibly replace it with a new WP_Query object for the
main query resulting in different post results.

Thanks,

I've obviously created something of a red herring by serialising the 
error output and unserialising it together with a typo. Let me explain 
the problem a different way:

Here is the code:

         if (!isset($_POST['updraft_restore']) || 
!is_array($_POST['updraft_restore'])) {
             echo '<p>'.__('ABORT: Could not find the information on 
which entities to restore.', 'updraftplus').'</p>';
             return false;
         }

I have a user who (every time) hits this error condition. When I get him 
to print_r his $_POST array (in the same code, so there's no other code 
editing the $_POST array), he gets this:

Array (
     [action] => updraft_restore
     [backup_timestamp] => 1366984477
     [updraft_restore] => Array
         (
             [0] => plugins
             [1] => themes
             [2] => uploads
             [3] => others
             [4] => db
         )
)

How can that happen??

This mailing list isn't the best place to ask this question. You'd be
better off asking on the support forums at

Message-ID: <CAJP0MM6jBUd+AeaYVrmqKj2k4NKVJgwJQyDRoVttW=K=rK0F6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi hackers,

I'm Manikandan from Chennai, here's my proposal:
http://manikandansaravanan.com/gsoc2013/

I'm proposing a plugin that allows people to effortlessly migrate their
WordPress installation from one web host to another.

I'm summarizing my proposal here:
There are basically two cases when migrating one's WP installation - 1.
Retaining the same domain name 2. Moving to a new domain name.

1. Retaining the same domain name
I propose a straightforward way to do this. The user can export all his/her
data into a neat zip file which contains the following:
a. JSON files containing serialized data from the DB (one file per table).
b. Media such as images etc.
c. Folders containing themes and plugins.

The resulting zip file can be uploaded at the destination installation
(after installing the proposed plugin) and that's about it. There's no need
to worry about the serialized PHP containing the WP URLs since the domain
name is retained.

2. Moving to a new domain name
Apart from the challenge of modifying the serialized data to accommodate
the new domain name (and doing some magic with the length of the strings),
the actual migration can be done in two ways:

a. The export/import method described above.
b. The live transfer - this is where my core ideas come to work. We can
transfer data from the old WP installation to the new one in real time as
both installations may co-exist for some time as the new installation is
done in a totally new domain. The transfer of database entries can be done
by a series of RESTful API calls to the old installation that produce the
database entries as serialized JSON. The transfer of media and other files
and directories can be done as a series of recursive "wget" calls.

---------Questions--------

I have some specific questions for Mr.Nacin:
1. Does my idea make sense? Or are there things that I'm missing out or
taking for granted?
2. What is the deadline to submit my proposal?

Sincerely,
Manikandan

These are one of these thing where I go crazy on parenthesis. If have
struggled with the NOT's and AND/OR in other programming languages. Sometimes 
the first NOT would negate the ||, making it &&. So your first condition would 
be not isset (= FALSE), 2nd not is_array ( = FALSE), but not instead of || it's &&
and so FALSE && FALSE, yup that is true, error hits.

So i just wrap each condition in parenthesis.

if ( ( !isset($_POST['updraft_restore']) ) || ( !is_array($_POST['updraft_restore'] ) ))

I know it's not an explanation, but a solution. Maybe it has to do with 
the PHP version, I don't know.

Maybe like this:
 if ( ! isset($_POST['updraft_**restore'] ) || ( isset($_POST['updraft_**
restore'] && ! is_array($_POST['updraft_**restore'] ) ) ) { }

Well, short version is that it can't, and as far as I can tell, it doesn't.

$ php -v

$ cat test.php
<?php

$_POST = unserialize('a:3:{s:6:"action";s:15:"updraft_restore";s:16:"backup_timestamp";s:10:"1366984477";s:15:"updraft_restore";a:5:{i:0;s:7:"plugins";i:1;s:6:"themes";i:2;s:7:"uploads";i:3;s:6:"others";i:4;s:2:"db";}}');

if (!isset($_POST['updraft_restore']) || !is_array($_POST['updraft_restore'])) {
        echo 'yup';
} else {
        echo 'nope';
}

$ php test.php
nope



So, maybe find out what PHP version he has, and/or try some extra
parenths, or something along those lines.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Joining the GSoC flood
Message-ID: <517E8E40.9090903@gmail.com>

Hey everyone!

It's an honor to finally meet you all: I've read so much of your code 
that I feel I already know you, but talking in the flesh is a whole 
different story. My name is Nico Badano, and I'm a web designer and 
coder from Rosario, Argentina. I'm interested in joining the Wordpress 
development team as a GSoC student this year, and have been looking into 
where could I help the most.

I've been working with Wordpress for 4 years now, even before starting 
my System Analyst career. I'm graduated in Social Communications, and 
had a strong design background before writing my first line of code. 
Right now I'm confident working on both aspects (and usually do) 
although they require such different mindsets that it usually takes me a 
day or two to "switch" modes :) I'm familiar with the codebase, but have 
never hacked into it (mostly due to Mika's persuasive posts everywhere 
in the support forums: "DON'T EVER EVER (EVER!) HACK INTO THE CORE FILES").

I've been going over the suggested projects in the GSoC page, and some 
(actually, most!) really caught my eye. I'm mostly interested in CSS, 
Javascript and responsive layouts right now, so anything on that field 
could work for me. The Enhanced Emails project sounds good too, but I've 
read that Boris Kuzmanov is already applying for it: if two students can 
work on the same project, I'd be happy to lend a hand with design and 
HTML/CSS insight. I've dealt with email styling in the past, and you 
would be terrified at how much work does it take to get email to show 
good accross multiple clients, browsers and devices. Other than that, 
I'd like to participate on UI adjustments like progress bars and 
touch-optimized layouts. Finally, I think it would be useful for the 
Wordpress community to lend a hand with the Trac, fixing bugs here and 
there or optimizing things. The great thing about that project is that 
it involves working very closely with the community, and I get to work 
accross the whole platform. This has the potential to teach me a lot 
about how Wordpress works. As far as I can tell, these are the right 
mentors for the said projects:

Trac Annihilation: ?
Email Enhances: Wojtek Szkutnik
UI Updates: George Stephanis

Am I on the right track here? Is there someone else I should talk to? 
I'll get in touch with a mentor as soon as I know which one. Are all of 
them checking this email list?

As a side note, all the websites I've developed I did on Wordpress, and 
have made many plugins for the clients over the years, mostly to enhance 
or provide some additional feature to the core. However, I have never 
adapted those plugins to submit them to the repo: I now find that is 
more or less a condition of acceptance for GSoC applicants... If that's 
the case, I can use this week to try and include one of them. The last 
two I developed had to do with Facebook (a Facebook login and 
registration plugin, and a latest photos/albums grabber) so maybe one of 
them could do as sample code? Would past projects (like websites made 
for clients) help on the screening process too?

I'm excited to be here: hope I make it into the development team this year!
Nico

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom taxonomy archive page
Message-ID: <CA+sFoLpTSo-ECpsf1r5rDjtXC_DYW9t_ATLm14vSuBNTDdg6YQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have registred a custom taxonomy for a custom post_type. The taxonomy UI
shows properly for that custom post_type in wp-admin and I can assign posts
to it.

When I try to access a taxonomy's archive page (using the display link in
the taxonomy UI in wp-admin), it is always a 404 page.

I looked a bit and here is the query generated:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.ID FROM wp_posts INNER JOIN
wp_term_relationships ON (wp_posts.ID = wp_term_relationships.object_id)
WHERE 1=1 AND ( wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id IN (13) ) AND
wp_posts.post_type IN ('post', 'page', 'attachment') AND
(wp_posts.post_status = 'publish' OR wp_posts.post_author = 1 AND
wp_posts.post_status = 'private') GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY
wp_posts.post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10

So the part giving me trouble seems to be:

AND wp_posts.post_type IN ('post', 'page', 'attachment')

Why does WP restrict to those post_type whereas my taxonomy is allocated
only to my custom post type?

Should I hack the query using filters?

Regards.

You shouldn't have to. Did you flush the rewrite rules by validating the

Well said Chris.
You don't have to like the code, but you'll never build something that
works as well, or has as many useful plugins.

I overreacted, just had a minor breakdown, just worked on a wordpress theme
as client wanted, and I really dont like their logic. I dont like plugins
and all of that stuff, like to code row php, javascript on my own and be
able to do what ever I wont. I remeber using wordpress for some website two
years ago and then you had much more freedom. Now I see its all about the
money with wordpress. I am using it becouse client asked me. I will never
use it again. Really sorry for the bad language!

I'm genuinely interested in what you mean by this and why you wrote
it. Why do you feel you have less freedom with WordPress than you did
two years ago, and why do think it's now all about the money?

I can take a crack at this.

When I started building WordPress sites well before 3.0 they were a pretty
decent fusion of "you can put up a simple blog with no programming" and
"you can program whatever custom thing the client wants in a fairly
straightforward way."

With 3.0 there was a major revision to the front, but also to the code. At
that point I was pretty enthusiastic about a number of the new features and
figured the aches and pains would get sorted through as the code matured.

But the changes since then have moved towards a more commercial interface,
rather than a programmer-friendly one at the same time that WordPress is
being touted as a business solution and being adopted by clients who want
more and more customization. It's not really mature enough to be a stable
business app in several regards (buggy custom types, some weird stuff in
image handling, no smooth deployment process, etc.) but it's losing that
smooth ease of use for bloggers too because there are so many things being
added. As an example, doing custom stuff to the header area now requires a
much deeper understanding of WordPress, not just PHP. This is, in part, a
tradeoff of growth. Software never expands to new 'easier' end user
functions without sacrificing simplicity of code, and most of what's
happened to the header is objectively a win, and it doesn't stop a
programmer who knows WordPress from customizing.

But what about the new "text" view? Every one of my clients calls me up to
hand-tweak the display of content on a page once in a while. That task just
got less reliable and more expensive with the newest iteration and the
admission (by name change from html to text) that that's not REALLY a
programmer's view to customize display of content. Why can't I customize it
as I need to? Why does it strip CSS and do odd things to space? Was there
an actually compelling case for that?

Some of these are growing pains and to be expected, but in part these are
issues with a community that, while fundamentally impressive in what it has
accomplished, nonetheless seems to lack a certain maturity of software
experience. I have been shocked to be told right here, by leaders, that the
problem with updating a database when moving from development to a live URL
is not a problem with WordPress. Search and replace in a database is a
fundamentally unsafe operation, and to recommend third party tools for this
absolutely necessary function suggests a real lack of experience with real
world large-scale (i.e. corporate) sites.

As one final example of what I see as a "teenage growth period" rather than
"selling out", I fully expect to have a  couple of suspects here explain to
me in glorious detail why and how I'm wrong. At least, that's the response
I have gotten, not from lurkers or noobs, but from some of the luminaries
of WordPress when I have raised issues that affect many of my clients'
adoptions before. Rather than wanting to learn from the on the ground
cases, people who raise these issues are often told we're doing it wrong or
we should buck up and be a real programmer and write a script, or...

I hope this may be helpful. I really love WordPress, and when I reinvented
myself the most recent time, it was the technology I focused on. I'm old
enough to perhaps futilely wish that I can spend the rest of my career
developing depth on the bench in one area (it was Java before WordPress)
and I'd like to see this community do well for some time to come.

To that end, I think there are some real issues with some of the recent
WordPress directions, but I've found limited interest in discussing them
politely and with an open mind.

Thanks,
Shasta

I'm a wp developer since 1.5 and I've seen this wonderful cms grow since
its very first times.
I think there are still many features to add to make it the
final-corporate-cms-of-life (eg. a decent multilingual system) but I like
it as it is.

Dobri, do your clients have ever tried any other cms around before
complaining of WP?

A lot of that resonates with me, too. Particularly about lack of 
experience in large scale environments. We build and host WordPress 
websites for the UK government and the following problems top my list:

  * Ease of deployment and switching between environments
  * Content staging (other than post/page previews)
  * Poor test coverage
  * Dreadful code quality in plugins

Like Shasta, I'm confident that these are growth problems rather than 
"selling out" (I'm not even sure what the latter means, really...)

But I am also often pretty irritated by stuff posted here, and by 
infantile features like this one:

https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/formatting.php#L3301

After my experience trying to push back on that, and on a few other 
things, I think twice before raising tickets or submitting patches. For 
fear that they'll just be rejected out of hand. Or that, without hours 
of tedious discussion, nothing will happen.

In that example, Matt more or less decided that scratching his own itch 
was more important than the autonomy of WordPress' users, and then 
suggested we write a plugin.

Sigh.

I'm replying here rather than on your site so others can join in the
conversation.  I have a few questions and a few observations:

*Are you recommending this as a plugin or a patch to WordPress core?*  Your
proposal mentions "the first version of the plugin" but also attempts to
address "problems with the current implementation."  The current
implementation *is* core.  So will your plugin modify core's implementation
or add a new one as a replacement?

*"They can?t be managed intuitively, you have to read their documentation
in order to get things done."*  What is "they" in this context (you're
referring to problems with the current implementation) but I'm unsure of
what you are saying can't be managed.  Options? Emails? Posts created by
email?

*"You have to perform some additional actions beside sending an email in
order to have it posted on your blog which isn?t user friendly at
all."*Aside from configuring the email address in the first place,
what
additional actions are you talking about?  In your proposed implementation,
writers would *still* have to configure the plugin and their mail account
to get things to work.

*Technical Stuff - using Markdown/HTML/RTF for formatting* - I think the
use of HTML for formatting the message would be a great first step.  Most
writers will be using a WYSIWYG email client (like Gmail) in the first
place and can easily control their formatting that way.  While I, too,
prefer Markdown, I think that might be a bit too advanced for the scope of
a summer project.  Perhaps specify categories in some sort of pseudo
shortcode format at the bottom of the post (which can be parsed and
stripped out by the plugin)?

For example:
[category]Miscellaneous[/category]
[tags]WordPress, GSoC, proposal[/tags]

*Main Settings - All posts displayed in a table with ordering* - The
current implementation of Post by Email creates new posts that are regular
WordPress posts and which are visible on the All Posts page.  Your proposal
makes it sound like emailed posts will be available in a wholly different
UI.  Are you suggesting emailed posts would be distinct and separate from
posts created inside the WordPress dashboard?  If so, why?  What happens to
these posts if the email plugin is disabled?

*Technical Stuff - updating posts* - It sounds almost like you're proposing
some sort of live update for the WordPress front-end after a post is
published by email.  While this would be a cool feature, I think it's
outside the scope of your overall project.  Live updates are a very
different beast; don't overcomplicate things.
*
*
*Technical Stuff - using flush()* - I think you misunderstand what flush()
does.  Once I request a page from a server running PHP, the page is
returned to me and the connection is closed. Another user calling flush()
on the server side will have absolutely no effect on what I see on the
page.  All it does is clear PHP's output buffer.
http://php.net/manual/en/function.flush.php

All of the above are just my thoughts while reading through your proposal.
 Feel free to respond here and keep the discussion going.  When you feel
you're ready to apply, be sure to use the Application Template (
http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC_2013_Application_Template) so we have all
the information we need.

No clue what kind of issues you have with deployments and how WordPress need to solve them. Same counts for content staging. It isn't something WordPress need to care of. Also content staging is always a pain but not a common one when you have good rules.

Test coverage is growing and there isn't a real good coverage number for as I know. You need to run the unit tests in different ways to do so.

Code quality in plugins isn't something WordPress core can fix. Also when you think that is an issue then build it yourself. That is always what I do for large scale environments. It's almost stupid to use a plugin for something that does so much more then needed.

About capital_P_dangit() you are right and we do a lot of feature creeping right now as the Post format UI and to less focus on bug fixing.
This doesn't mean you can't create a ticket and looking at your tickets you don't do it wrong at all. 1 closed, 1 fixed with props and 2 open tickets where 1 is debatable for a fix.

Why not use a true GUID? XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX It's a fairly
standard and recognizable data structure.

The resulting UUID of the users may conflict between on systems with a

If this kind of conflict is possible, then there's a flaw in the UUID
system you're using.

Hate is a consistently, terrible word. It breeds close-mindedness,
and makes it very hard to have an open debate.

Let's try to leave "venting" off this email list and focus on finding
solutions.

Nedelin,

Responding here rather than on your blog so others can join in the
conversation.

I think your goal of having the API - including testing - done in a month
is spectacular, if not ambitious.  Does this include full documentation of
how the API works and can be extended by plugins/themes?  Or would that be
handled after the API is in place (during the same timeframe used to
recreate existing widgets)?

Otherwise, I think this looks fantastic and I look forward to seeing the
full application :-)

> No clue what kind of issues you have with deployments and how WordPress need to solve them. Same counts for content staging. It isn't something WordPress need to care of. Also content staging is always a pain but not a common one when you have good rules.
Primarily, it's the database munging you have to do to transfer a site 
from one host to another. It's also a little annoying that the whole 
WordPress codebase has to sit in the web root, and that uploads sit 
alongside code in wp-content. I understand why these things are the way 
they are, and it's not *that* bad. Just a bit annoying for us since 
we're doing automatic continuous deployments in an environment where we 
have to meet government security standards. For us, it would be useful 
if we could stash the whole of WP in /usr/lib or something, and it would 
be great if we didn't have to have webserver-writeable directories 
alongside code.

That said, I do understand why most of those things are like that and 
wouldn't expect them to change on our account. We are probably an edge 
case. But things like the database rewriting are just unacceptable.

> Test coverage is growing and there isn't a real good coverage number for as I know. You need to run the unit tests in different ways to do so.
This has long been a bugbear. I would like to be able to check out some 
tests and run them in our CI. I'd like those tests to fail if one of our 
projects or a plugin does something dumb that breaks one of WP's 
assumptions. I would like that test suite to be so good that plugin and 
theme authors would want to write tests for their code because it would 
be strange not to.

It's a cultural thing as much as anything else, and -- frankly -- the 
PHP/WordPress community are so far behind Ruby/Rails people and others 
that it's a bit embarrasing. WordPress is now the only reason we use PHP 
at all!

> Code quality in plugins isn't something WordPress core can fix. Also when you think that is an issue then build it yourself. That is always what I do for large scale environments. It's almost stupid to use a plugin for something that does so much more then needed.
Again, this is more of a cultural problem. But I do think there are 
things core could do to improve the situation, like providing an API for 
people to create and modify files that plugins need to be writeable, 
instead of letting plugin authors sprinkle them about in WordPress 
codebases where the entire core is writeable by the webuser. Which is 
another unacceptable thing, imo.


> About capital_P_dangit() you are right and we do a lot of feature creeping right now as the Post format UI and to less focus on bug fixing.
Glad you agree :)

> This doesn't mean you can't create a ticket and looking at your tickets you don't do it wrong at all. 1 closed, 1 fixed with props and 2 open tickets where 1 is debatable for a fix.
That's useful feedback - appreciated. But part of the reason is that I 
don't raise tickets unless I'm pretty confident that the thing is just a 
bug, and isn't some weird wontfix or policy decision. Also, sometimes 
things just seem to get ignored. Like this one:

https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18039

And then I post snippy comments that I subsequently regret :)

Is there documentation on the GUID? I thought it was a Microsoft closed
algorithm. About the conflicts, I threw that in in case you wanted to use
integers (decimal) only (for faster query operations) and in case the
resulting new UUID (decimal) conflicts with the old id, then that aproach
can be taken, if that is the case, but if not, the simple new UUID
conversion is taken with no conflicts.

ohh, I am sorry, nobody was looking at the post with my idea (I was
checking this each 12 hours in the statistics) so I began to change it
writing directly on the site, publishing it from time to time, but I lost
my internet connection when I was at the university. So you have read a
draft which wasn't meant to be read by someone. I am really sorry, I will
come with a structured version ASAP and will try to answer all questions
you provided. Thank you a lot for your feedback. Again, I am really sorry.

It's also a little annoying that the whole WordPress codebase has to sit in the web root, and that uploads sit alongside code in wp-content. I understand why these things are the way they are, and it's not *that* bad. Just a bit annoying for us since we're doing automatic continuous deployments in an environment where we have to meet government security standards. For us, it would be useful if we could stash the whole of WP in /usr/lib or something, and it would be great if we didn't have to have webserver-writeable directories alongside code.

Changing from host doesn't need you to touch the database. Moving from domain does and that does make sense and not hard to do.

You can do a lot of things like that but you have to do it yourself. WordPress does let you do that but you need to write a small plugin to make that happen.

I'd like those tests to fail if one of our projects or a plugin does something dumb that breaks one of WP's assumptions. I would like that test suite to be so good that plugin and theme authors would want to write tests for their code because it would be strange not to.

You can help out to make the tests better. You can use the tests for your projects and then build a script that enables your theme/plugins. Never tried it to do so.
But seeing the last comment I'm not sure how good you know the codebase and now what the exact test coverage is

>

But I do think there are things core could do to improve the situation, like providing an API for people to create and modify files that plugins need to be writeable, instead of letting plugin authors sprinkle them about in WordPress codebases where the entire core is writeable by the webuser. Which is another unacceptable thing, imo.

No clue what you are talking about but seems as a case WordPress shouldn't do something at all. The power of plugins is that they can do a lot.
If you want a secure environment than develop the plugins yourself. Seems as a easy answer but it is a fact when you can code well enough.

Well 22 months is nothing compares to the oldest open ticket (8 years). The problem is the amount of open tickets (3738).
For 3.6 it's most likely too late for it but will see if we can fix it in 3.7

Hello Eric,

Thank you for the kind reply, I plan for the documentation to be written
after the API is done and working and the dashboard widgets have been
created. I have just put up my application, so feel welcome to check it out!

Hey everyone,
after getting some first feedback (thanks Daniel) on my first proposal
(Widget Collections) I just now published a blog post on a "Code Editor
Refresh" project.

Would really like to get some feedback on this one: http://yrnxt.com/~230
I really think it is a important project. The WordPress code editors are a
launch pad for possible to-be developers!

I really, really dislike when people use the "wp-hackers" mailing list to complain about WordPress but offer no solutions for fixing it. Here's why:

"WordPress doesn't do X, so it sucks"

WordPress is a toolbox, if it doesn't have the kind of hammer you want: go get a new hammer, but you don't have to throw out the toolbox. This is a problem with people being WP developers, then PHP developers, and not the other way around. WP is just a bunch of PHP code. PHP developers can code around its weaknesses while getting the benefit of everything else that comes for free with the framework.

"I haven't figured out how to do X, so WP sucks"

I think there are many scenarios where the developer is the problem, not WP. If you are running a website at scale and you don't know how to handle deployments and migrations and DB migrations, maybe you aren't the right person for the job. Or maybe you need to learn how to do those things, learn more WP internals, and learn how to solve problems. Try the Support forums. I know many people who can do those things, they aren't impossible, and in most cases, aren't even difficult, just takes some elbow grease to learn how.

"There is a bug in WP, you guys haven't fixed it, so let's burn the house down"

There 3000+ open tickets, many of which do have patches. Because your pet ticket isn't patched yet does not mean that WP is wholly broken and everyone that is working on it is careless. It just means that "your world" is not "THE world." The biggest complainers are almost always the people who are NOT in IRC, do NOT attend dev chats, and do NOT submit patches. Thanks for the help, guys. Come be part of the solution and you will find that you can eradicate more problems along the way.

Thanks for the apology! I'm hearing the frustration we all feel when the
client wants something the toolbox really can't handle. Clients can be so
insensitive, but they do put the bread on the table.

Wordpress is currently being sold in many places as the complete CMS for
every use. It's good to see people being honest about it's limitations; it
could be Sharepoint.

Is this in response to me? If so, that seems like an extreme reaction. I 
also find all the quoted statements rather annoying, and I don't think 
I've said those things, nor assumed that the core team should stand to 
attention when I submit a ticket for my pet bugbear.

We use WordPress for lots of large scale sites and we *have* figured out 
how to handle deployments and database migrations, and numerous other 
things besides. None of those things is insurmountable. But some of them 
are needlessly hard.

What I'm saying is that as WordPress grows and develops, if it is part 
of the community's vision for WordPress to be used more by large-scale 
sites, governments and corporates, then there are some aspects of 
WordPress that could be improved. Things which are important to those 
clients, for those projects, but not so important to bloggers et al.

Things like being able to stage a complex new bit of content, consisting 
of numerous posts, pages, menu items and widgets, and to test all those 
things, without them being visible in public.

Or changing the way widget options etc are stored so that moving sites 
between domains doesn't require error-prone database rewrites.

Or actively setting an example in the way we test to try and encourage 
better code quality in plugins.

Or supporting better mechanisms for deploying updates, which is perhaps 
a good example of what I'm talking about. The current approach of 
one-click updating in the admin is *totally reasonable* for the majority 
of users who would otherwise not apply critical updates. But it's also 
totally *unreasonable* in a professional environment where applying 
updates is part of a well-resourced process, and where having 
webserver-writeable code is an unacceptable risk. It's right and good 
that one-click updating has been done the way it has, but also sensible 
to consider whether adding support for other approaches might help 
WordPress's adoption by other sorts of organisations and projects.

These are, imo, all perfectly reasonable things to want to do.

And there it is. "Stop talking about the problems! A real developer would
just solve them."

We HAVE solved them, or we wouldn't be working in the field. I deploy sites
that range from small blogs to very large corporate presences regularly.
Because I have a deep background as a programmer (Java, not PHP) I also get
called in to fix other people's messes. I'd say those messes run 5:1 due to
the lack of integrated deployment strategy for WordPress. At this point
when someone says "my site just stopped working!" it's the first thing I
look for: is there a slideshow (etc.) pointing at a now-turned-off
deployment address?

As for offering solutions, a few months back I watched a fellow propose
that he personally would work on code to add to core to fix the
database-hack at deployment problem. He asked only for some assurance that
the leaders in the community were actually interested enough in including
such a solution that they'd consider his solution if it was solid. He
didn't get that. He got explanations for why it wasn't necessary, so I
presume he didn't proceed.

In many ways this is a hostile environment if you have anything other than
pure praise, no matter how carefully you explain your case or how politely
you put it. Nothing is perfect, but the ability to listen to criticism
openly is a sign of a mature environment, and absolutely critical to
improvement.

Yes. Bang on. That's exactly the reason for my reticence in suggesting 
things and writing patches as well.

"database-hack at deployment problem"

Is there a Trac ticket and patch you could champion? Did you bring it up at any dev chat for the 3.6 cycle?

That wasn't a response to you but a generalization that does exists.

Staging things is an issue but not a big one. Most content don't need to be moved. You don't do testing with content.

Widgets options can't be stored differently. Look into serialization and you will found out yourself. You just need another script for when you want to change a domain.
And what said before moving content should be a rare condition.

Deploying updates is good how it is now. You saying that yourself by that it fits the majority. For a professional environment you turn it off yourself and make the files not writeable by WordPress. That isn't hard at all to do.

Again, this is just the sort of reaction that's quite irritating.

You may not find staging a big issue. We do.

You may not need to move content around. We do all the time.

You might not test with content. We do.

Of course widget options could be stored differently. There's almost 
never only one way to do something.

And we have, as I mentioned, already dealt with the updating issue, and 
numerous others. We have solved these problems. That doesn't mean that 
WordPress couldn't be better.

Your whole post seems like an attempt to prop up the status quo, instead 
of putting yourself in the position of someone else and thinking about 
other ways WordPress is used, and ways it could be made better.

No matter what the suggestion or criticism is, "go write a script" is 
always a possible solution. So it's a bit pointless to say it. We 
already did that. If everyone did that all the time, we'd never have any 
new features!

GUID is just an acronym - "Globally Unique IDentifier" very similar to UUID
- "Universally Unique IDentifier"  Yes, Microsoft uses GUIDs more often
than anyone else and has their own proprietary algorithms, but it's a
common standard that's built in to many DB systems as well.

MySQL, for example, even features a UUID() method:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_uuid

You can store UUIDs in the database in a Binary(16) column:
http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?98,49626,49922#msg-49922 This will make
queries just about as fast as working with integers.

If you're migrating data from one format (auto-incremented integers) to
another format (a true UUID) then the chances of having an ID conflict from
one system to the other is nil.

Just a head's up, the full URL for your proposal (
http://code.aniketpant.com/2013/04/gsoc-2013-uuid-abstraction/) 404s ... so
no one else can leave comments at the moment.

Some might call you insane[1] for continuing to submit patches when (so) few (if any) get committed.

I solved an issue with HTTP concurrency, Web Services, and curl_multi. I have been to many WP conferences and meetups and Community events and have evangelized this. Hardly anyone else thinks they need it, knows what it means, or cares. So guess what, it isn't in core yet - even though *I needed it* and (I think) *WordPress needs it!!*

If you feel so passionately about these issues, channel that disdain for the status quo into Trac tickets and patches and see them through til they are committed. That is quite literally the only way to affect core.

I am a member of this mailing list too, and 98% of the emails are about something that should be in the support forums or someone whining. For anyone, if you *need* help, probably use Support forums. If you *want* to help, PLEASE come to Trac. 

If WordPress sucks and you have figured it out and everyone else is doing it wrong, I'm sorry, but I can't hear you over your lack of patches in Trac.

It's right and good that one-click updating has been done the way it has, but also sensible to consider whether adding support for other approaches might help WordPress's adoption by other sorts of organisations and projects.

If you are running a website at scale and you don't know how to handle deployments and migrations and DB migrations, maybe you aren't the right person for the job. Or maybe you need to learn how to do those things, learn more WP internals, and learn how to solve problems. Try the Support forums. I know many people who can do those things, they aren't impossible, and in most cases, aren't even difficult, just takes some elbow grease to learn how.

Thanks for the help, guys. Come be part of the solution and you will find that you can eradicate more problems along the way.

I had 60+ committed in 3.6 so far - https://core.trac.wordpress.org/search?q=wonderboymusic&noquickjump=1&changeset=on

I had none committed in 3.4 because I was upset that no one was championing my patches for me

I play with all kinds of projects and I can see your issues. But the issues is, should it be in core? And the rule is if 80% of the users will benefit from it then it will. Which is not always the case tho.
The issue is that you think in "I" and not in WordPress user base in general. What is fine.

If you know a better way for storing options then create a ticket and patch the issue. I doubt that you will find one since with data serialization you can store lots of things. JSON was one time mentioned but has limitations.

I think always to other people and it seems that you only think in the position you are (how many "we do"). And as told that is fine but please don't get angry when you don't get it your way.
If you know me you would have known that I have comments on features and the process of handling tickets.

If you are running a website at scale and you don't know how to handle deployments and migrations and DB migrations, maybe you aren't the right person for the job.

I know many people who can do those things, they aren't impossible, and in most cases, aren't even difficult, just takes some elbow grease to learn how.

Seemed like some issue with WP Super Cache.

All this (and other contributions to this thread) seems to ignore the fact
that many, many contributions *are* accepted, and people's suggestions
*are* incorporated. For example, 260 people individually named as
contributors (http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/) or the 950 track
tickets resolved (
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=3.5&group=status&page=10&order=priority)
in version 3.5

That's hardly hostile or not accepting of changes.

Yes, there are things that the core team are reluctant to change, but that
doesn't include everything. And it doesn't mean that things will never
change, but maybe that a viable solution with enough advantages hasn't yet
been proposed *and proven*.

As for those implying that the WordPress (core) developers have no
experience of deploying at scale, please take a look at
http://vip.wordpress.com/clients/

As hard a fact as it is to swallow, everyone on this list is part of a
minority of WordPress users. Some of the things that affect you and a dozen
other people on this list are really edge cases.

And if you are still interested in somebody else providing a solution for
deploying from test/staging or moving WordPress installations, there are
mature supported solutions out there:

http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/
http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/

And I don't expect these two example will address everyone's concerns.
Maybe go buy their products and as a paying customer they might consider
some of your suggestions to improve the way they work.

The problem is that most effort channelled into Trac tickets gets ignored.  I'd be surprised if 15% of the 62 issues I've raised on Trac with a patch[1] has actually been addressed somehow. And most of the ones marked "fixed" didn't actually address the issue I raised.

With the other communication channels added over the past few years there's become little reason to use this list anymore. Probably the one reason is to discuss issues like this.

Many (most?) people who come to Trac with patches in my experience do not have their efforts rewarded with fixes in core.  Patches on Trac are not a panacea.

I understand that it is not reasonable to expect all Trac tickets to be resolved to the reporters satisfaction, but it's also not reasonable to present Trac as the cure-all when issues are raised about project governance.  

There are real concerns, expressed in respectful ways by people like Harry and Shasta; treating all people who raise the issues as whiny problem makers does not help.

Trac can be painfully frustrating, but it's the only way a bill becomes a law. Once I started subscribing to the firehose of ticket email, hanging out in IRC during bug scrubs, and spending more time patching orphan tickets, I became way more satisfied with how things work. 

If you were to post a valid patch on a ticket right this second with a thoughtful comment, and that ticket was a defect / bug, Sergey would trip over himself running to the keyboard to mark it for 3.6, and might commit it on the spot.

That perspective applied blindly is one of the problems.  BTW, this is a general comment about WordPress project governance and not directed at you.

I agree the 80% should apply to **end-user features**. Unfortunately the same benchmark is used when it comes to discussions of APIs and certain standardization.  

For example, deployment could great benefit from an API and some standardization of the process which would allow 3rd parties to all build off the same base.  There need not be everyone bungling through the details of deployment; WordPress could add a standard way for programmers to deal with it and then plugins and themes could enable far more than 80% of users to benefit. As it is right now the efforts to solve this problem are widely fragmented and consume a huge amount of time of people that could otherwise be much more productively used.

Let's look at a wildly successful feature that was added that 80% of users didn't need: Custom Post Types.  Since CPTs were added themes and plugins and even custom site builders have used them to great effect, and that has helped well more than 20% of users. But directly speaking, less than 20% would have said "we need this" because 80% or more are bloggers who to their own eyes just need posts and maybe pages.

When a coterie of core developers identify the need for an API in something they want, they dive in an add it without the need for 80% of users to directly benefit.  As it should be.  But when there is a broad need for an API that most of the core developers don't currently need but many developers on the outside do they dismiss it as not being something for the 80%.

The problem is developers build things for other people. I don't know what the multiplier is, but let's say that for every developer solving a problem 10 end users benefit.  If that's true, and considering cross over, then if probably only 20% of developers need something then it probably would benefit over 80% of end users.

Here is a perfect example[1] of a feature that is badly needed that could probably benefit 100% of user but probably less than 5% of end-users have no clue why it is needed.

Listen, I'm not trying to upset the apple cart. In general WordPress' processes work well. But the 80% end-user rule applied to efforts to standardize and potential internal APIs is a bad use of the rule.

Harry mentioned poor quality of plugin code and you said it cannot be helped. It most definitely could be helped by providing a plugin framework that handles most of what needs to be done in 80% of plugins using a declarative approach similar to register_post_type().  I've even written one such plugin framework I use for client projects and it's on GitHub, although I've not had time to document it yet so I won't point to it. But if you apply your formulation of the 80% rule to the question of should such a plugin framework be included in core it will never even be considered even though it would solve many problems for the user-base at large.

Here's what I propose. I propose that instead of the rule of thumb "Will 80% of end-users need it?" be changed to "Will it directly or indirectly solve concerns that 80% of end-users have?" 

> Which is not always the case tho. The issue is that you think in "I" and not in WordPress user base in general. What is fine.

Conversely when I see your replies challenging issues others bring up it always seems you are saying "I don't experience this problem so I reject that it's an issue worthy of concern" even if a lot of people are actually dealing with the issue. 

It's hard to get away from "I" 

And in this case I am being specific about your replies, I have noticed them many times on Trac and in wp-hackers in this manner. 

Just giving my perspective as a counterbalance to yours.

> JSON was one time mentioned but has limitations.

As a side note, I'd be curious to know what practical limitations you are referring to.  The API world is finding that JSON can handle pretty much anything that is needed for real-world use-cases.

Ok, that seams better, that way, the use of GUID wouldn't interfiere with
anything else. So should I send this proposal or what would you recomend?

so, here is my fully "refactored" idea:
http://jukgsoc13.wordpress.com
I tried to include answers to all the questions provided by Eric Mann,
thank you once again for your feedback.
I excluded ajax idea because "it's outside the scope of ... overall project".
And tried to be as explicit as it is possible in a project proposal. If you
have any questions, ideas, remarks, things which would be good to include
in the proposal please let me know. I will be glad for any kind of feedback.

Thank you in advance. Have a nice day

If it's benefit an user indirectly it still benefit the user. Deployment is easy to talk about but in the next releases WordPress has other things to fix first. Not saying it isn't important but there are other priorities.

CPT is a bad example. That was really needed. I can't say 80% but it was a lot. People used Posts/Categories to manage flows. And as said the 80% rule isn't always used.
See a fresh new API for themes and Image handling. Indirectly they benefit from it but hard to say how.

The example of posts relationship is also something that is a bad example. A lot of people want to include that in core but still a lot of things to be dealt earlier. See the amount of open tickets. Adding features does not reduce that.


Also it's lame to attack me personally without mentioning of tickets. Obviously you will find more tickets that I say that it should be closed then it should be opened. Also I almost never use +1 in tickets.
Also it is my opinion about how people using it and I can be wrong. That doesn't mean that I can't tell my opinion about it. That would be lame.
And as far as my memory goes you mean 1 particular ticket that you disagreed on. And in the end it got closed because more people agreed on that.


You can store objects in an option. Smart thing or not but going the JSON road would limit that. JSON is damn handy for data transfer and on public API level it's used for almost everything.
That said I don't play that much with options and fine in how it is.

I couldn't agree more, mike. Exactly right.

That perspective applied blindly is one of the problems.? BTW, this is a general comment about WordPress project governance and not directed at you.

I agree the 80% should apply to **end-user features**. Unfortunately the same benchmark is used when it comes to discussions of APIs and certain standardization.? 

For example, deployment could great benefit from an API and some standardization of the process which would allow 3rd parties to all build off the same base.? There need not be everyone bungling through the details of deployment; WordPress could add a standard way for programmers to deal with it and then plugins and themes could enable far more than 80% of users to benefit. As it is right now the efforts to solve this problem are widely fragmented and consume a huge amount of time of people that could otherwise be much more productively used.

Let's look at a wildly successful feature that was added that 80% of users didn't need: Custom Post Types.? Since CPTs were added themes and plugins and even custom site builders have used them to great effect, and that has helped well more than 20% of users. But directly speaking, less than 20% would have said "we need this" because 80% or more are bloggers who to their own eyes just need posts and maybe pages.

When a coterie of core developers identify the need for an API in something they want, they dive in an add it without the need for 80% of users to directly benefit.? As it should be.? But when there is a broad need for an API that most of the core developers don't currently need but many developers on the outside do they dismiss it as not being something for the 80%.

The problem is developers build things for other people. I don't know what the multiplier is, but let's say that for every developer solving a problem 10 end users benefit.? If that's true, and considering cross over, then if probably only 20% of developers need something then it probably would benefit over 80% of end users.

Here is a perfect example[1] of a feature that is badly needed that could probably benefit 100% of user but probably less than 5% of end-users have no clue why it is needed.

Listen, I'm not trying to upset the apple cart. In general WordPress' processes work well. But the 80% end-user rule applied to efforts to standardize and potential internal APIs is a bad use of the rule.

Harry mentioned poor quality of plugin code and you said it cannot be helped. It most definitely could be helped by providing a plugin framework that handles most of what needs to be done in 80% of plugins using a declarative approach similar to register_post_type().? I've even written one such plugin framework I use for client projects and it's on GitHub, although I've not had time to document it yet so I won't point to it. But if you apply your formulation of the 80% rule to the question of should such a plugin framework be included in core it will never even be considered even though it would solve many problems for the user-base at large.

Here's what I propose. I propose that instead of the rule of thumb "Will 80% of end-users need it?" be changed to "Will it directly or indirectly solve concerns that 80% of end-users have?" 

> Which is not always the case tho. The issue is that you think in "I" and not in WordPress user base in general. What is fine.

Conversely when I see your replies challenging issues others bring up it always seems you are saying "I don't experience this problem so I reject that it's an issue worthy of concern" even if a lot of people are actually dealing with the issue. 

It's hard to get away from "I" 

And in this case I am being specific about your replies, I have noticed them many times on Trac and in wp-hackers in this manner. 

Just giving my perspective as a counterbalance to yours.

> JSON was one time mentioned but has limitations.

As a side note, I'd be curious to know what practical limitations you are referring to.? The API world is finding that JSON can handle pretty much anything that is needed for real-world use-cases.

	image editor?
Message-ID: <07FFBA3538C0434E9C69CD9BA520A6C1@gmail.com>

I'm looking for a way to add additional options to the image editor's percentage reduction buttons. Currently the smallest is 60%, but 50% would be very useful for those of us working with high-density images for Retina displays. I haven't been able to find anything in the Codex for modifying this. 

Any ideas?

Where do you see the reduction buttons? I can't see them. Sure it isn't a plugin?

That was the only major thing I saw in your proposal, but if you want to
edit it to reference GUIDs rather than hashes I can take another look.

And by "edit it" I mean publish a post *on your own blog* with the full
description rather than just a long post here.

If you add an image to the post content area, click on it, and then click on the picture icon it'll bring up the image editing modal. It's not a plugin.

Currently the smallest is 60%, but 50% would be very useful for those of us working with high-density images for Retina displays.

Those are hardcoded into

I was thinking about image editor like in making it really smaller. This is just the image dialog or how you want to call it. It isn't possible as far as I can tell. It's hardcoded in HTML. Obviously you can change it with a javascript file.

Also always loading retina images isn't a smart move.

Yes I did.

As you can see the term is correctly detected in the URL:
wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id IN (13)

Also I forgot to say that I also tried to deactivate all plugins.
