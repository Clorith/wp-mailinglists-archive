If you try these two they are different headers:

http://s-plugins.wordpress.org/all-in-one-event-calendar/assets/banner-772x250.jpg
http://s-plugins.wordpress.org/all-in-one-event-calendar/assets/banner-772x250.jpg?bust-cache

So it would seem to be a caching issue.  Dunno how long the update will take.  Otto?

s-plugins.wordpress.org is a Externally hosted CDN - Edgecast to be specific.

Right now, the only way is to wait for it to update, the Edgecast CDN
has a long cache expiry time, so WordPress.org needs to be updated to
add a Cache busting version/revision parameter by the look of it.

Sit tight for now, and someone will get the it fixed "soon" - I'm sure
you'd rather it fixed instantly, but that's not possible right now.

Hi Dion (and others),

Don't know if you or anyone else has noticed but the banner image is being served with Content Type "application/octet-stream" instead of with "image/jpeg."  Not a big deal but it's not correct HTTP and more practically it causes a browser to download the file rather than display it if accessed directly via a URL.  FWIW.

Thanks for mentioning it Mike (Saves me looking into why it was
happening), I also noticed that, and am in the process of p2'ing it :)

I'll be adding cache busting soon. It's been on my todo list for the last
week.

Sorry for the brevity and typos, sent from my phone.

Are you using the same versions on localhost and production?
I've fixed a few bugs related to Cookies and HTTP in trunk (and
there's more fixes on the way) - specifically around cookies with 0
values and session cookies (which sounds like what you're going to be
using..):

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&component=HTTP&milestone=3.5&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority

Hey, what do you know. On our staging servers we run trunk and on our live
site we run the latest stable. I didn't even think of that.

Thanks!

A way around this is to convert and rename the banner image from jpeg to png or the other way around.

Hello at all,

yes, the TinyMCE is an long story and big implementation.
But maybe its an idea for the feature, that WP get an new editor -
faster, smaller and an better customization, API, Filter- and Action
Hooks.

Current I like the Redactor Editor (http://redactorjs.com/). Its an
small lib with many possibilities to create an custom editor. The
editor works only with jquery, but this is current a big part of WP
backend and exist on all backend pages.
It's also possible to add hooks for wp standard solutions.

Maybe other people have also ideas, hints or comments to this small mail?
Thanks for your time
Frank

Looks great! But it's license is not GPL compatible. :-(

Yes; maybe it is possible that Automattic buy this project and change
the licence; like other projects.
Yes, it is a wish.

Yes it is!
I'm following this project for some time, and they switched the license  
just recently from GPL/MIT to CC-by-nc.

If you care, you can fork version 7.6.1:
https://github.com/imperavi/redactor-js/blob/master/js/redactor/redactor.js

But I doubt core team will ever move away from tinyMCE, this is a lot like  
git migration.

If they've switched licenses to the point where we can't use any later
versions, then using the code makes no sense as there's no longer a
viable upgrade path.

As mentioned this project has shifted it's licensing in a recent fork and
Otto was simply stating that if they do this again in the future and it
becomes incompatible with WordPress' licensing requirements then a viable
upgrade path goes out the window.

If they were alerted to the fact that changing their license back to
GPL could result in their software being many orders of magnitude more
popular, they may very well just change it.

The cache-busting parameter has been implemented now. It will take
effect on the next plugin update.

So touch the plugin's readme.txt file or perform some other update of
your choice, and the cache will get busted for your banner image. It
will then get busted again when you change something in the assets
directory going forward.

Hi Martin,

Of course you can: look at /xmlrpc.php file on line 65 (WP 3.4.1). You 
can filter on "wp_xmlrpc_server_class" and get your class instanciated!

So is loaded after plugin is loaded:
class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php is loaded in xmlrpc.php on line 55 and in
my plugin i can't do

class my_xmlrpc_class extends wp_xmlrpc_server ...

Is it posible?

Arguably changing to CC-by-3 isn't even a legit license for software (mind, js is weird when it comes to that). Is generally a documentation license. Someone may want to point that out to them.

Yes. You need to hook to the wp_xmlrpc_server_class filter, define
your class at the time that filter runs, and then return the name of
the class.

add_filter('wp_xmlrpc_server_class','my_class');

function my_class($name) {

class my_xmlrpc_class extends wp_xmlrpc_server {
... class stuff here ...
}

return 'my_xmlrpc_class';
}

I was going to say the exact same thing, but Otto said it more elegantly.

That was my immediate thought as well. However it's clear the moved to the "NC" licenses so they could start selling licenses:

http://redactorjs.com/download/

But moving back to GPL would cut an easy, obvious and immediate revenue stream for them so I fear they would not want to switch unless someone could show them how to easily generate more revenue by switching back to GPL.

While we have discussed approaches on this topic for our own needs[1] maybe the list would be open to brainstorming how Redactor could generate more income if they were to switch back to GPL?  

- Is there any low-hanging fruit that could leverage that they have not considered?  
- Are there enterprise features that companies would pay handsomely for so that the base version that most people would need could be made GPL?  
- Are there any supporting subscription services they would be compelling enough to build a business around? 
- Is there any other way they could generate income from switching to GPL?

I'm just thinking if we help them figure out how to switch to GPL and still generate the revenue needed to support their business they'd be much more likely to do so.

We haven't tested Redactor yet ourselves but on Frank's recommendation I think we would like to consider incorporate it into our planned GPL software if we could, and get rid of that PITA known as TinyMCE.

[1] We're planning to release plugins to support our business that will be GPL licensed.

I don't see it that elegant.
I also don't believe such decisions should be adopted in great open-source  
projects: "If it's no longer supported, we won't bother looking at it...".
But, that's just my opinion.

Mike, me and others (I believe) are definitely looking forward if  
someone's going to make a plugin out of it, personally I'm keeping an eye  
on that project, as I see it as one of the most decent wysiwygs that can  
replace dinosaurs like tinymce.

this was my goal on start to this thread and discussion.

I think, its possible that WordPress show, that the GPL is great.
So much installs and people usage WordPress with an editor. I think
thats an great benefit for this editor, also in other projects and
trainings. It is possible, that peoplle write and speak about this lib

WordPress cannot drop GPL. There's too much in it that demands it, and unless you wanted to rewrite the whole thing from the ground up, it's just not an option. Can it be done? Yes. Would it? Not if it wanted to keep the name WordPress.

Yes, Redactor would be beneficial, but they're diesel fuel and we're a regular kind of car :/

I think Frank was suggesting that WordPress forks the GPL version of
the editor, not change it's own licensing to match the current version
of the editor code.

I like it too. However it's far from being ready for anything more than 
comments/bbPress editor. Been following several jQuery based editors, 
all have little more than the default browser contentEditable functionality.

This one is definitely more polished than most but still lacks a lot of 
things. For example: no plugins, no way to extend it other than hack 
into it, very minimal APIs, try copying and pasting something from 
another browser tab, then look at the HTML. And a big one: no undo/redo 
for all actions?

Totally hypothetical question: Assuming they changed their license to be compatible with WordPress, would people in the WordPress community be willing to contribute to Redactor to improve on the limitations that you mention?

I don't see this as a fair question.
Why people from WordPress, why not Drupal, or... any other CMS/blogging  
engine.

Fixing Andrew's list of missing features, doesn't necessarily mean  
WordPress will bundle it in core.

I don't know... Probably some will as it is nice. However considering 
the amount of work needed, not sure if that would be enough. Roughly it 
would take a good team of several full-time developers at least a year 
to bring it closer to TinyMCE.

Nearly all JS editors get off the ground fast by adding UI to the 
browsers built-in contentEditable functionality. Once there, most try to 
tackle few more tasks and stop. The next step requires a lot of work: 
creating APIs, dealing with tons of browser quirks, etc.

Currently there are several other editors at approximately the same 
stage. The problem is that a lot of the functionality for editing HTML 
should be in the browsers. It can be handles much better there than 
trying to extend the limited contentEditable mode with JS.

So unless the browser vendors decide to sit down and make and implement 
a nice specification for editing of HTML, don't see how this situation 
would change.

Message-ID: <CAHzHH8f3nz2uc3kt+_osooE9D63fWdFSc0KQBoWb3ScXc59wrQ@mail.gmail.com>

I was researching the issue of serialized data in the WP database impacting
its portability, because I'm considering suggesting WP for my new
employers' CMS needs. I stumbled across a post on WP
Tavern<http://www.wptavern.com/one-way-to-make-wordpress-less-portable>from
April of this year where Otto left a comment containing the following:

"There?s better ways to set up your dev/staging/production environments,
without needing to change URLs around."

I'd be curious to know what strategies people have come up with for
managing this process with WordPress, as it's something that I've found
challenging to deal with, especially since I always handled changes the
"naive way" that Otto mentions.

Hopefully this is the right place for such a question.

Cheers,
Josh

Because this list is for WordPress developers, not for Drupal developers or developers of other CMS/blogging engines.  I don't think asking if the Drupal community would do something to benefit WordPress users would make much sense on this list, do you?  Would you go to the Romanian parliament and ask them if the Hungary, Serbia and Moldavia parliaments would be willing to do something for the benefit of the Romanian people?  Maybe, but I doubt the answers you'd get would be very authoritative. 

> Fixing Andrew's list of missing features, doesn't necessarily mean WordPress will bundle it in core.

True, but irrelevant. Not fixing them means that WordPress would certainly never bundle in core, right?

Hypothetical questions are meant to explore possibilities, that's why I asked as a hypothetical.

Any chance Matt might be willing to lobby his friends at Google and Mozilla to make this happen?  :)

Apparently I was misunderstood, and somebody took this personal.

You question was addressing WordPress community like this is exclusively  
one man's problem, and its not.

To explain this as in your answer, if it were crisis in Europe, I would  
start searching solutions in my own country, but also ask around for help.

Andrew, has a point saying there's need of collaboration, and it would be  
nice to see WordPress role in such a project.

Many (if not most) online document editing services (eg. Google Docs)
don't use contentEditable due to its limitations and cross-browser
incompatibilities. They use direct DOM manipulation instead.

Thinking out loud: I wonder if there are any WYSIWYG editor projects
out there which are using DOM manipulation instead of contentEditable
mode?

I didn't take it personal, I took that you were not understanding that my *asking* the question was completely appropriate.  Remember, you told me the question was "unfair."

> You question was addressing WordPress community like this is exclusively one man's problem, and its not.

No, I did not address it as it it was one man's problem.  If everything in the world where viewed this way then no progress would ever be made because the benefits that result from efforts are (almost?) never evenly distributed amongst those who contributed.  Is Tim Berner's Lee the richest man on the Internet?

Instead I asked a question to determine if the benefit of the software was worth enough to the WordPress team to make sure it happens.

As an example, assume my family lives on a dirt road with 5 other families.  Let's assume we speak to the local government and they say they will not pay to pave the street but that if we want to pay for it they will. 
Let's say we decide it is very important to us to see the road paved. We could choose to:

1.) Go to each of the other families and spend a lot of time to convince them to pay for 1/5th of the road.
OR
2.) We could decide to pay for it ALL ourselves EVEN though the other families would benefit. 

#1 would be more "fair" in your view, but it might be a LOT more hassle and might result in it never happening and might even result in bad relations between neighbors if some are willing to pay and others are not. Plus it would certainly take a lot more time to achieve #1.

So depending on the cost and how it compares to our family's net worth and cash flow and how badly we want it it might be much easier to just pay for it ourselves even though others would benefit it.

This type of question is a completely valid question to ask in business, in families and in communities like WordPress.  

So the unstated assumption in my question was "Would this have enough value to the WordPress by itself for the WordPress community to do it without the hassle of trying to convince other communities to do the same?"  There is nothing "unfair" about that question, it was a simple, rational, amoral question. And, since I've asked I do believe the answer was" "No, it wouldn't be worth it for the WordPress community alone to make it work." So I know have more information on which to make decisions.

> To explain this as in your answer, if it were crisis in Europe, I would start searching solutions in my own country, but also ask around for help.

If you were running a country in Europe and you had a problem FOR WHICH AN EASY SOLUTION exists even if it would help others, you would be foolish to go through all the effort to try to get other countries to all agree because you would be wasting effort that would not be needed to just make it happen for your citizens.  

Of course if the problem is hard or is too expensive, then yes you can go ask others to help.  But the first step is to ask the question:  Is this a problem for which the cost of fixing it is less painful than the cost to recruit others to help. Not asking the question is to potentially eliminate the best option. That was ALL my question was meant to determine.

That post is a very good read for everybody interested in online editors.

Direct DOM manipulation is perfect for Google Docs, but we really need 
the WYSIWYG HTML part :) Not sure there are any online HTML editors that 
don't use contentEditable.

Exporting from Google Docs to standard HTML5 would be neat too.

Subject: [wp-hackers] error in using wp_insert_comment. date puzzle.
Message-ID: <CAHERW=1hg8nSCq6rQ=Xtke8vGfiqQVs9osB+gJx723ChtVE=Bw@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to programmatically insert comments in  a bulk operation as
part of migration routine.
Comments are in a SQL server table.

I receive the date info from the SQL server table field and store it in a
PHP variable like the following way;

while( $row = sqlsrv_fetch_array( $RS, SQLSRV_FETCH_ASSOC))
{
                       ...
$the_date = $row['the_date'];
...
}

var_dump view of the $the_date is as follows;

object(DateTime)#97 (3) {
  ["date"]=>
  string(19) "2012-07-30 00:00:00"
  ["timezone_type"]=>
  int(3)
  ["timezone"]=>
  string(3) "UTC"
}
then I prep my wp_insert_comment's data array.
var_dump view of that data array  as follows;

array(7) {
  ["comment_post_ID"]=>
  string(5) "73615"
  ["comment_author"]=>
  string(14) "Joe  (USA)"
  ["comment_author_email"]=>
  string(20) "user at domain.com"
  ["comment_content"]=>
  string(2001) "commment text here"
  ["comment_parent"]=>
  int(0)
  ["comment_date"]=>
  object(DateTime)#97 (3) {
    ["date"]=>
    string(19) "2012-07-30 00:00:00"
    ["timezone_type"]=>
    int(3)
    ["timezone"]=>
    string(3) "UTC"
  }
  ["comment_approved"]=>
  int(1)
}

After the wp_insert_comment operation, I get a 0 in return - indicating an
error.

And the following message stops the whole process.

Warning: preg_match() expects parameter 2 to be string, object given in
F:\inetpub\....\wp-includes\formatting.php on line 1868

Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message

How can I go around this problem and store the date properly?  2012-07-30

You need to get a date string from your DateTime object and pass that
into the comment_date parameter instead.

$comment_date = $the_date->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');

Subject: [wp-hackers] Theme Customizer (adding header uploads,
 moving sections and controls, conditional blocks)
Message-ID: <CAEgmxaZq9Q2JE=pcZ1EQMRTFCokJHoJ=H4xhQB07z4R5Z_qyzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

What I'm trying to achieve: I'd like to remove some of the core features,
move others and add my own. Using my section headers. And I have some
conditional options ('advanced').

Trimmed layout might look like this:

[Header]
Header image upload
Header image text

[Background]
Background loader

[Site colours]
Text
Links
Nav Background
{advanced selectbox - if ticked show the H settings}
H1
H2
H3

[Menus]
Main Nav
Footer Nav

I tried moving things around using $ctrl = get_control('header_image');
$wpc->remove_control('header_image'); $wpc->add_control($ctrl,
array('section'=>'my_head'));

I tried rebuilding header upload
using WP_Customize_Filter_Setting, WP_Customize_Header_Image_Setting,
WP_Customize_Header_Image_Control
as is done in core (adding in a section argument to my section). No dice.

The 'advanced' section is easy to do on a theme options page, as I can wrap
blocks in my own divs and show/hide them with jQuery. Is there a way i can
get some generic HTML into the customizer panel to do the same? Or am I
looking at some v.targetted jQuery?

Any pointers? I feel like I've missed something obvious.

Hi All,

I just tagged a new release in the SVN repo for my plugin.

And now I have a massive yellow box at the top of my plugin page.
Claiming the Plugin has not been updated to two years.
The Last Updated Date is quite clearly 2012-8-3
But yet the yellow box is there.

Any thoughts as to what I have done wrong?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't this have a huge performance
penalty, since you're declaring a class inside a function? (Which IIRC
can't be cached properly by an opcode cache)

(In this case, I'm assuming it's necessary since wp_xmlrpc_server won't
be declared when the plugin is loaded, but I'd like to make sure.)

Do you have documentation on this?

I was looking for docs on opcode caches being able to cache classes

Ryan,

I don't know the real nitty gritty details here re: opcode caching, but
I'll ask, how is this manifestly different from what WordPress plugins
already do? Classes get conditionally included from functions all the time,
and PHP opcode caches appear to deal with that just fine. See, for example,
the code for activate_plugin() in wp-admin/includes/plugin.php.

Cheers,

 -- Peter

Subject: [wp-hackers] Community conventions for custom post types?
Message-ID: <CABQWr5xBy816QXzr17twzfEYmcd8=6EW44O64RM4CuXJqXU3Gw@mail.gmail.com>

One of the most compelling reasons for me to develop small to midsize CMSs
on WordPress is that WordPress has really emerged as the lingua franca of
this market segment.  When an existing WordPress user comes to me wanting
enhancements, upgrades, or redesigns (which happens increasingly) I *love*
how much I just magically know about their existing codebase without having
to do a bunch of discovery.

I was wondering if, towards this end, there had been any sort of community
effort to standardize custom post type and/or custom taxonomy nomenclature
for common CMS implementations?

For example, if developer A implements a custom post type with custom
taxonomies for menu items on a restaurant CMS, it would be great if
developer B could take for granted the conventions developer A was using.
And both developer A and developer B could make interchangeable restaurant
themes that worked perfectly right out of the box on each other's
restaurant sites.

Does there already exist somewhere a sort of community consensus around the
implementation of common custom post types that would encourage ease of
interoperability?  If so, I'd like to be following it.  If not, does it
seem like a potentially useful thing to others?

Just curious.

I think what you're looking for is a plugin that comes with its custom 
post types: two different developpers will be able to make 
interchangeable themes on top of that plugin. And even if the plugin's 
not active, the theme won't necessarily break because it'll implement 
templates like "single-restaurant.php" or so.
These are the conventions I know.

The fact that many themes come with their own implementation and logic 
(restaurant themes as you pointed out for example, which create their 
own post types and taxonomies) is in my opinion not the right way of 
doing it. You should be able to change theme and keep the data available 
in admin, but that's rarely true with those themes and it's too bad.

There is no set of conventions that I'm aware of, but a community
document that details several conventions is a very good idea and
would allow for interoperability. Why not start one, see if you can
get somebody else interested.

Thanks, Otto.  I think maybe I will try to collect some thoughts and see if
they appeal to anyone else.


Thanks also, Lionel.

I was originally given to believe that you should never do with custom
taxonomies what you could just as well do with native taxonomies.  I
believed (and still sort of believe) that your WordPress data degrades more
gracefully if it is all just posts and pages and categories and tags and
post formats.

The problem I was having with this ideal is that while it is intuitive to a
WP developer brain to think of every sort of content as either a post or a
page, it was much less intuitive to my clients.  And I started to worry
that I was sacrificing an elegant CMS user experience on the altar of best
practices.  More and more I catch myself straying the other direction,
making a garbled mess of the WP database towards the end of a beautiful,
easy, CMS user experience for users who simply prefer this to the
intangible benefit of interoperability.

It seems like lots of developers are doing this.  Some very cleverly.  But
no two identically.  I feel like if we could make a collaborative
repository of these sorts of innovations, we could sort of make common
cause between developers who love WordPress for its amazing flexibility and
developers who love WordPress for its interoperability.

Any idea on how to make a page have numbers? For example if I make a page
called 2009 and its trying to make it 2009-2, I guess for the archive
permalink system, anyway to disable that? As this is only being used for
pages, so no posts.

Never ran into an issue like this before.

That plugin works, but like it says, you won't be able to use
<!--nextpage--> or have multi-paged posts anymore.

Hi,

I'm curious too. Can you give an example or two of the kind of conventions
you are thinking of?

I think all I really meant, Ade, was to extend the concept of Post Formats
to common  Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies that I routinely see
others implementing for CMSs.  Maybe it's not really necessary.

Once upon a time (pre-3.1) if you wanted to do targeted styling for an
"aside-like" post  and I wanted to do targeted styling for an "aside-like"
post we would both probably implement that in a very similar but not
interoperable way.  Which would probably be relatively easy to resolve.
 But now we can just know that we are both just using the aside post format.

Today, if I get two restaurant clients with two restaurant "Premium"
themes, they very frequently will have two different sets of very, very
similar but not interoperable custom post types and/or taxonomies and/or
meta.  I just thought it would be nice if I could say that my
restaurant-related theme or plugin was "Portable Menu Taxonomy Spec
vX.X-compatible" (or what have you) it could add up to a big time save.

I mean, if everyone building a restaurant CMS (or art gallery CMS or
whatever common CMS implementation) knew where to go for the consensus spec
and there were snippets for everyone to register everything in the same
manner...  (And if you had a solution that was very uncommon, well this
wouldn't pertain to you.)  Or would that just create more hassle than it
eliminated?

I mean, I take Lionel's point that a lot of the premium themes are "doing
it wrong" which kind of reduces my suggestion to: Let's all do it wrong in
the same way.

But often (this week in particular) I catch myself wishing for just this
sort of consensus.

WordPress automatically adds p and be tags to the content before you echo it. To get around that, either make your code into a shortcode (preferable) or remove all line breaks from your code.

Thanks Will,

Pardon, but you say compress it, like the whole code in a single line?!

I removed the tags on output ("\n \t")  but still the code outputs with 
breaks and html tags.

I haven't heard of something like this around CPTs or Taxonomies, but
I know there is, for example, this one around custom fields for Geo:

Hmmmm.. what you're looking at is a lot like asking developers to 
*register* a custom post type they create in to some sort of central 
repository.

or maybe creating a custom post type plugin for some of the most 
commonly used custom post types i.e. portfolio, menu

and tell other devs to extend those custom post types instead.

or just ask the core team to add *common* custom post types into core 
(which I doubt is going to happen) like post formats.

But I think the idea of having a place where authors can reuse commonly 
used post types is a good idea. The hard part here is getting other devs 
to use it. But, once it gets big enough, who knows where it goes.

Theme developers could then use the custom post type plugins here as 
dependencies for their themes.. (assuming they can be persuaded them to 
use this)

Basically, I think this is more of an developer education issue.

My initial reaction was that this is a great idea. I've also come up  
against the issues the OP raised, and have been a little frustrated that I  
have had to reinvent the wheel to maintain some sort of compatibility with  
a plugin or theme.

However, what are we really talking about here? Off the top of my head, the  
main areas where one would like to see consistency are in naming  
conventions, eg post_type 'restaurant', rather than 'restaurants', for  
example, so that template naming is predictable, and rewrite rules. So, one  
convention could be that, like 'post' and 'page', the CPT registered name  
must be singular. But once you get beyond this, I'm not sure much can be  
standardised. For example, I would not support a convention that says  
that 'restaurant' must be non-hierarchical. In my use case, I may  
need 'restaurant' to be hierarchical. (Note: I hope I'm not  
misunderstanding the kind of conventions that people are thinking about.)

Re dev education, I would certainly like to see further promotion and  
reinforcement that CPTs and CTAX's should never be are registered by a  
theme, only a plugin.

Think about metadata and the formats therein. A restaurant may have
odd opening and closing hours, and storing that data in a sane format
that was the same across plugins/themes might be useful.

Exactly.  I think it could be a really powerful convenience if plugins knew
to expect certain common metadata to be stored in a certain fashion.  Kind
of analogous-ish  to the way the larger web uses microformats.

And it would seem to me that if you made the spec for each common CMS item
maximally complicated and taxonomy overloaded, then the extra data would be
there for developers who wanted it and could be gracefully ignored by
developers who didn't.  Similar to Post Formats.

And its worth noting, that while post formats were a nice benefit for
developers, think of what a much, much bigger benefit they were to
non-developers.  Then think of the benefit to non-developers who could know
that if their restaurant plugin or theme was "WordPress Community
Restaurant Standard"-compatible that they could use any other theme or
plugin that also was and it would just work.  And their legacy data would
always persist.

And there is the benefit of having the community standardize these sorts of
implementations for the sake of novice developers.

There is indeed documentation on the codex, for example: http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Extending

If you only need to add new methods or tweak minor details, then please only do that instead of extending and replacing the entire class. But if you really want an example of how to do it, check out my plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xml-rpc-modernization/

I was looking for OOP PHP example rather than functional examples. In
the docs there is no OOP example.

Thanks to Otto now it's working as expected/wanted ("my_xmlrpc_class
extends  wp_xmlrpc_server { ..." - the OOP way )

I agree with you and think it's a good idea to have some kind of
conventions with these types of CMS, and that makes me think of BuddyPress,
which is exactly what you say: an standard implementation of a community
management and social networking CMS.
It's extendable so that there are many BuddyPress plugins (so plugins of a
plugin) and many "BuddyPress ready" themes too!
You might achieve your goal in doing the same thing: developing one
reference plugin which gives the convention. The other way is taking an
already existing and widely adopted plugin as the base of the your
convention.
I'm aware it's not that simple (BuddyPress is supported by Automattic) and
you could achieve it in just writing standards :).

Extending a class should generally be a last resort, if you can't get
the functionality you want in another manner. The problem with
extending the class is that only one piece of code can do it, whereas
multiple pieces of code can add actions/filters and such.

Coming from other frameworks (ZF, Kohana, Proprietary PHP, PHP + Smarty), I
tend to do CPT's like MVC...

wp-content/my-plugin/plugin.php // authoring and calls bootstrap
wp-content/my-plugin/boostrap.php // this file handles auto-loading, and
creating files.
wp-content/my-plugin/models/cars.php // this would be the post type
wp-content/my-plugin/controllers/cars_controller.php // this would be
functions, etc. related to ONLY cars model
wp-content/my-plugin/assets/stylesheets/cars.css, // this file is
automatically created for you
wp-content/my-plugin/assets/javascript/cars.js, // this file is
automatically created for you

FYI, I have an abstract class, which is extended for making models (CPTs)
easier to create. Here's a Gist <https://gist.github.com/3260411> of how I
create CPTs.

Yes, there is basically one css and js per model, but on the production
site they (the css & js) files are concatenated and minified using Googles
Closure into one file.

Subject: [wp-hackers] creating posts with taxonomy when creating that
	taxonomy
Message-ID: <CAFQFuXPq2oHBXMNJVVJoNveRYkahCPJOQqibdVb9wajcfhLcng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using wp_insert_post hooked to create_{$taxonomy} to create a bunch of
posts when a term is created for a custom taxonomy. I'd like to have those
inserted posts automatically be given the term that created them, but can't
figure out from where to get that piece of info, or how to do it.

Is that info in a global maybe ($wpdb?), and could it be used somehow with
the tax_input key of wp_insert_post?..

Thank you!

WordPress does automatically add <p> and <br> tags to anything that
goes through the the_content filter (i.e. if you output a post's
content with the the_content() template tag). You can avoid that in
particular instances by doing something like this:

remove_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop' );
the_content();
add_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop' );

However, I can't see use of the_content() in your code - it all seems
to be running through the Zend_Gdata_Photos class.

I got stuck once in a similar situation, and for the <br> tags,
there's a simple CSS workaround. If you can isolate the tag that wraps
the area where you don't want <br> tags, just add something like:

#wrapper br { display: none; }

Not sure about those stray <p> tags though...

Hi Kirk,

I think you are talking about wp_insert_term, which fires
"create_{$taxonomy}" and "created_{$taxonomy}" actions.
You get actually the inserted term_id into the first argument. For example:

function my_create_custom_taxo($term_id) {
    // I can use the $term_id to get the term object
    $term = get_term($term_id, 'custom_taxo');
}
add_action('create_custom_taxo', 'my_create_custom_taxo');

Subject: [wp-hackers] Script to add testdata to WordPress via commandline?
Message-ID: <501FA4CC.20807@gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been working on a set of Phing scripts[1] to automate setting up
WordPress installations. The only thing* I'm missing right now is
inserting test data.

Does anyone know of scripts/code which adds test data to WordPress and
can be run from the commandline (not from within WordPress)?

Thanks,

* Still working on automatically setting WP_DEBUG, WPLANG & Multisite,
but it's on my wishlist ;)

You could always setup a cloned copy of a site, with the exact settings you
want and any test data, and have the script just put in the correct domain.

Not sure this is what you want though.

I bounced the read me to hit the last release, and then updated back to the stable one again.

That cleared it up.

Pushing the tag and the read me update in the same commit appeared to have confused it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Superseding WordPress templates and globals
Message-ID: <CAJmHdU+hhAraVOrmUSN_V56yVp5DjnnUEHL9OUqhv2FPT4btXw@mail.gmail.com>

So, I'm trying to clean up our WordPress template, which has quite a few
custom pages (as in page-my-page.php). I figured the best thing to do would
be to throw all those pages into a subfolder in my theme called pages and
then use template_redirect to check to see if a custom page template exists
in that folder.

When I do that, though, I lose access to all the globals such as $post and
any plugins that use classes. So, is there a better way to include the new
template or add a new place for WordPress to find a template than using
template_redirect? Is there a huge negative performance impact if I do
something like loop through all the globals and set it as a global inside
the function?

Rather than the template_redirect hook you'll probably want the
template_include filter. Example:

add_filter( 'template_include', 'my_template_include' );
function my_template_include( $template ) {
  if ( something_or_other() )
    return locate_template( 'pages/foo.php' );
  else
    return $template;
}

This filters the name of the template which WordPress' template loader
loads. Using this method you'll still have access to all the globals
which WordPress loads when it loads a template.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Customize user profile page
Message-ID: <E43F5B93-FF1B-44FE-A177-CA9CBE0491B3@getmoxied.net>

I currently have a theme I am working on that will allow registered WP user to edit several custom fields as part of their profile.  In addition I need to modify the current fields (change css, etc) as well as remove some of the existing fields which are rendering from core.

The current strategy I am thinking is to use code from edit-user.php, add-user.php, and users.php to create a plugin which will allow me to reskin and add new functionality to users.  Is this a good strategy for going about this?

I am just looking on some insight on best practice for modifying user profile page.

Open to any and all suggestions for this.


Thank you in advance,

Dmitry Tokmakov

There are hooks for adding/removing profile fields. I suggest you to take  
a look at:

That seems like a good plan, I must mention that for large scale social
network creation, from experience, it is better to program it from scratch
as opposed to base it of WordPress.

Thanks, but having the option to just add testdata programmatically
would be easier for my type of testing than having to setup an install
to clone from.

Hi all,

I've posted before about Whippet (our standalone development server for 
WP) but have now finally got around to blogging about it, with some 
usage examples:

http://dxw.com/2012/08/introducing-whippet/

If anyone's interested in giving it a go, it would be great to hear your 
thoughts, and ideas for improvement. I've been using it for all my 
development since I originally posted about it, and it's made my life 
easier :)

Yeah, but i'm thinking about to create custom post type which duplicate the users section, and use save/add new/ delete actions to populate and make changes into wp_users table, 

this will take the way less time then building custom user profile from scratch.
what you think about this solution ?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Grouping taxonomy queries
Message-ID: <CAOqAKWBqTbQTOG0Q70ean9sLXPMDd_HWH93iiwEYypx4KxHm0Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have a situation where I'd like to perform a tax_query for posts in term
A OR posts in term B AND C. Written another way:

Posts in ( term A ) OR ( term B AND term C )

Terms A, B and C are in different taxonomies, although from a technical
point of view this is not relevant.

What I'm really asking for is to be able to group two of the tax queries
(for terms B and C, using AND as the operator parameter) and then use OR as
the operator parameter between it and the tax query for term A. This is not
possible with the current tax query structure.

Has anyone tackled this or something similar before? It looks to me like
I'll need to drop the tax query and filter the SQL in order to achieve what
I want.

Any suggestions, code samples, etc most welcome.

John

You have to do a join for every condition, so tax_query probably isn't the best mechanism. Here's how the query will end up:

SELECT ID FROM wp_posts p
INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships AS tt1 ON (p.ID = tt1.object_id) // for your IN condition *or* AND condition
INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships AS tt2 ON (p.ID = tt2.object_id) // for your AND condition
WHERE 
// IN condition *or* AND condition
( ( tt1.object_id IN ( $a_tt_id ) ) OR ( tt1.object_id IN ( $b_tt_id ) AND tt2.object_id IN ( $c_tt_id ) )

// this isn't the whole query, you'll want to check post_status, etc

So, if you can grab the term_taxonomy_ids you need first, you can do $wpdb->get_col with a query like above and then do a WP_Query with 'post__in' with the get_col result array

Sounds like some array with an order is defined with no quotes, such as
array ( 'order' => 0 ) instead of 'order' => '0' as it is managed as a
string later.

Why didn't you post the full error message? That bit you left off is
the important bit.

Anyway, this error comes from things like this:

$order         = ( $attr['order'] )   ? $attr['order']   : 'ASC';

Here he's referencing $attr['order'] without checking to see if it's
set or not. This should be:

$order         = ( isset( $attr['order'] ) )   ? $attr['order']   : 'ASC';

Message-ID: <CAHERW=1XbXO2mjRyZoAJo3ebUUO8JJrzfiAK4+Bhakd2BRWBRw@mail.gmail.com>

I just noticed that in a standalone PHP page when I do

echo $_GET['x'];

I get "O'Reilly" when x is passed as "O'Reilly".

But when I load the wordpress code using define('WP_USE_THEMES', false),

I end up getting "O\'Reilly" for the same input. The ' is escaped by \'.

This tells me Wordpress does use "addslashes" automatically to all the
GET/POST/COOKIES super globals.

I'm just curious; Isn't the use of addslashes functionality being
discouraged by the more recent versions of PHP? Why does WP have it
then?

And my second question is what should do plug in authors do? Apply
stripslashes? Are there any other undo's ( like addslashes to be
undone with stripslashes ) that I need to worry about when I read data
for my plug in code?

you have to use stripslashes everywhere, it gets insane - if you aren't careful, it will mess with your Cookies as well

If you implement custom auth, you have to know that WordPress stores slashed passwords, hashed in the database - and if you are checking username and password in wp_authenticate, you have to call stripslashes on the arguments passed

And if you are checking your Cookies for email, username or password against another authentication service, you need to stripslashes_deep your Cookies in the 'sanitize_comment_cookies' action

Message-ID: <CAMg3evFhvbjE1pGe8Yzc-mF0vAUjnf628Q1He7=fqrEbxzzhXw@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on a new site for my daughter's soccer team and have decided
to use it as an opportunity to learn more about Custom Post Types and
Taxonomies.  I have the basics working - I have defined a post type for
players and another post type for teams and each have a number of custom
fields based on what the team wants to track for each player and at the
team level.  I have also defined a taxonomy for player positions so the
players can be looked at by position.  I am struggling with how to define a
roster for a team and connect the player CPTs to the team and/or roster.
 Should the roster be a taxonomy or should the team CPT be hierarchical and
each roster is a child of the parent team?

My initial solution was to define the roster as a taxonomy as it makes it
very easy to assign each player to a roster (e.g. Fall 2012, Spring 2013,
Indoor 2012-2013, etc.).  But doing so doesn't really connect the players
to the team - for that I need to use a plugin like "Posts 2 Posts" or
reinvent the wheel which I'd rather not do.  So if I connect the posts,
does it make more sense to define the roster as part of a hierarchical team
CPT?

Right now I am doing this by trial and error as I learn more about post
types but with their first game a week away, I need to finalize my
solution.  I am hoping the collective genius of wp-Hackers has some
recommendations or can point me toward something similar that I can learn
from.

Ideally I'd like to end up with the ability to look back in time to any
roster which is defined to see which players were on the team at that time.
 There is a small chance that the site could grow to support more than one
team so I'd need to be able to differentiate the players who were on the
Fall 2012 roster of Team A versus the players on the Fall 2012 roster of
Team B.  I think a hierarchical post type would help me do this but I am
not sure if this is the best solution.

Thanks,

Mike

Hi Mike,

You may want to check out the Posts 2 Posts plugin. It has the sort of 
functionality you are looking for. You may also be able to look at the 
plugin code and pull out the parts you need into your own and not 
require the additional plugin in your WP install

Cheers,
Ben

I gather Posts 2 Posts is a good solution, but if it's not quite what
you need, this plugin might be worth checking out:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/developers-custom-fields/

There's no UI, but the docs
(http://sltaylor.co.uk/wordpress/plugins/slt-custom-fields/docs/)
describe how you can define a custom field for a certain post type,
then populate the field with the posts from another post type. Check
out the basic examples for registering custom fields, then look in the
docs at the 'options_type' and 'options_query' parameters for fields.

Cheers,

Steve

Hi Mike,

We've got a lot of experience with this type of use-case can what you need is a way to relate posts.  We've got our own internal code for relating posts but hopefully Posts 2 Posts will give you what you need.

Message-ID: <43062bea-efc8-4633-ad4f-27f347b67c82@googlegroups.com>

I currently use some flavor of HyperDB 1.0 (it doesn't exactly match the 
1.0 tag in svn, but it's very close), and I would like to upgrade it for a 
WP 3.0.1 multisite install that hosts 2300 blogs and serves up roughly 150 
million pageviews a month. 

I have noticed that HyperDB does not include a version number in the PHP 
file, and it looks like the svn repo has not kept up with tagging releases.

Can anyone point me to the proper version of HyperDB I should be using on a 
3.0.1 install of WordPress. Mine is basically this: 
http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/hyperdb/tags/1.0/ with a few lines of code 
changed related to checking tcp responsiveness. I want to be sure that it 
is totally compatible with 3.0.1, and I am not quite sure how to validate 
that in a reasonable amount of time.

Thanks for your help,
Dave

I think the real question is why would a "team" be a post type? A team
is essentially a group of players, wouldn't it make more sense as a
taxonomy?

If you need to define a post type for the team in order to have stuff
about that team in the posts-table (totally understandable), then I'd
associate the team-post to the team-taxonomy in an implicit manner,
perhaps by sharing the postname and the term-slug. Essentially, the
players and the team would both have the same terms in the
team-taxonomy.

Good idea Otto. That taxonomy list will get potentially huge, as all the 
teams will need to be re-added for each year. It may be easier to have 
the team CPT and use a custom field in the team member's profile to 
relate them to the team per year. Then the player can do all that work 
themself instead of the admin having to come in and make new terms each 
year. On login for the next year the player chooses their team for that 
year and boom, done. Or the coach can go into a team page that archives 
the list of players each year and create a new roster.

This exact question is exactly what I am trying to ascertain.  In our
situation, which I suspect is pretty typical, a team is more than a group
of players which is why in my current implementation I defined the roster
(which is absolutely a group of players) as a taxonomy and a team, which
has information (e.g. a coach, a manager, a treasurer, a mailing address, a
contact email, etc.) as  custom post type.

Where I am struggling, and right now I am leaning toward Posts2Posts, to
connect players to teams, is how to connect everything together.

Right now I have my Roster as a custom taxonomy and have created two terms
- "2011-2012" and "2012-2013".  I can go through the players and assign
them to the rosters they are part of.  Everything works great until I add a
second team and this is where I am stuck.

Here is a scenario:  Player 1 is a member of Team A for 2011-2012 and
member of Team B for 2012-2013.  Player 2 is a member of Team B for both
2011-2012 and 2012-2013  Player 3 is only a member of Team A for 2012-2013.
 Both Team A and Team B had rosters for 2011-2012 and 2012-2013.

I am not sure how I could uniquely identify the roster for Team A for
2011-2012.  I would need to connect a player to a specific team roster
which is why I started thinking that a hierarchical CPT might be a solution.

Why would I have more than one team?  Imagine a scenario where a club
fields multiple teams in an age group.  They may choose to play in two
different leagues with some overlap between rosters.  A pool of players can
be assembled into multiple rosters depending on the need.


Does what I am trying to do make sense?  Maybe I should draw a picture of
the relationship i am trying to construct.

Otto' advice was in time and very helpful then I felt like asking about 
using CPT and custom taxonomy in this case :)

Conferences (the CPT)
Years (the taxonomy)

Posts will be titled the same every year (a bad thing!?):

- Overview
- Photo Gallery
- Agenda etc

Still not sure if this is right, I found that using years as taxonomy seems 
meaningful to the subject, but so many doubts  haunts me...


Thanks for any suggestion!

This sounds close - I think what I am looking for is the unique combination
of a team and a roster term and be able to assign that to a player.  I
don't want to create a unique roster term for each team for each season but
that is effectively what I'd do IF I go down the hierarchical CPT path.

I guess I essentially want to create a third taxonomy based on the Team
CPTs and the Roster terms.  Has anyone done something like this?  Seems a
little risky as terms and team names could change but it would definitely
let me define a unique connection between a player and a team's roster for
a particular season.

We tried maintaining taxonomy slug to post type slug synchronization for a while, in part because of strong opinions on this list that taxonomy should be used.  

What we found was that it is very difficult to keep post types slugs and taxonomy slugs in sync on actively updated sites unless the burden to maintain the synchronization is on the user, which kind of goes against the whole ease-of-use philosophy of WordPress.

We found that there are subtle difference between the management of taxonomy slugs and post type slugs so we'd have situations where for example we'd get an 'example' slug for one and an 'example-2' slug for another.  And tracking down exactly why that happened was taking a lot of time because it was very hard to duplicate. We'd think we fixed it but then periodically we'd have problems and we could never 100% figure out why.

But since we've moved to post relationships it's been completely smooth sailing.  FWIW.

-Mike
P.S. What I'd love to see is for category, post_tag and custom taxonomies to become post types. But I don't hold my breath on that one... :)

Not really clear on the idea of a "roster" vs. a "team."  Do teams have multiple rosters, or something else?

Mike I am really leaning towards multiple CPTs. Otto can smack me over 
the head if I am wrong here, but this is what I envision

CPTs:
- Team - Contains the team info (Name, Logo, Description, Location, etc)
- Roster - Each team creates a new roster each year. Rosters can be 
managed by the user with admin access to the team (Coach?). A roster 
will contain the Team ID as it's parent ID. Each Roster can store the 
ids of its players as meta data
- PlayerHistory- Contains historical info on the player (stats, team, 
etc). Each player is a user, store that user's id as meta data here

Built in:
- Users: Coaches and Players should be users. Filling out the user's 
profile page will add data to them. Their current team can be pulled 
from the Roster CPT. Coach historical info could also be stored in 
Roster and PlayerHistory possibly
---- Putting coaches and players in here also allows the system to 
expand in the future and allows coaches and players to manage their own 
info. A plugin like Members could be used to setup roles and permissions.

3rd Party Plugins:
- Posts 2 Posts - Could be used to relate the CPTs if you do not want to 
do it pragmatically
- Members - Possibly used in the future if you wish to expand the site 
to allow players and coaches login access

This system could expand pretty well into a full platform for managing 
teams, players, and stats. That may be too complex for your situation 
though ;)

Hi Ben,

I understand now.  Roster = Team-Year.  

As for Users being Players, you *might* consider syncing Users with a Person custom post type (although there might be the same problem as with taxonomy and post type, but I don't think so.)  Users are not well suited for the types of things I expect you will want to do with a player, in our experience.

PlayerHistory:  Ideally that would be meta associated with your posts relationship but that's yet more infrastructure that's not implemented in WordPress.  You could model it with a post type and that's probably the best thing.

Hope this helps.
 
-Mike

Mike,

Creating a Person post type is pointless because it will be a one to one 
relationship with the User. It is quite easy to extend user profiles to 
add additional fields. I have done so many times on project. I can share 
code with you if you would like.

A new post will be created each year for PlayerHistory (unless you need 
to track per game) to contain all the stats. You _could_ put that as 
user meta called _Stats20XX if you wanted, but it would be difficult to 
implement in a quick smooth manner. Because it should be one(User) to 
many (PlayerHistory) it is better to keep it as a CPT. It also allows 
you to take advantage of the autogenerated interface in wp-admin and 
using tools such as GravityForms on the frontend if users want to login 
and manage it.


Cheers,
Ben

I think the use-cases we've looked at are different.  We want to treat a list of people the same way we treat a list of anything else.  Simply put, adding custom metaboxes and queries and the loop works differently for users than for custom post types.  

If Users work for you then awesome.  They don't really work for us.

> A new post will be created each year for PlayerHistory (unless you need to track per game) to contain all the stats. You _could_ put that as user meta called _Stats20XX if you wanted, but it would be difficult to implement in a quick smooth manner. 

True.  It really depends on what granularity you need.

You _could_ put that as user meta called _Stats20XX if you wanted, but it would be difficult to implement in a quick smooth manner. Because it should be one(User) to many (PlayerHistory) it is better to keep it as a CPT. It also allows you to take advantage of the autogenerated interface in wp-admin and using tools such as GravityForms on the frontend if users want to login and manage it.

"I think the use-cases we've looked at are different.  We want to treat a list of people the same way we treat a list of anything else.  Simply put, adding custom metaboxes and queries and the loop works differently for users than for custom post types."

If you are creating the metaboxes yourself then it is very easy to add 
the additions to the user's profile page with the hooks:
- show_user_profile
- edit_user_profile
- personal_options_update
- edit_user_profile_update

If need to add additional metaboxes from other plugins...., well there 
you run into issues :)

Adding custom taxonomies is also just as easy.
http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/10/20/custom-user-taxonomies-in-wordpress

WP_User_Query makes querying users just as simple as WP_Query does. The 
loops and such are similar
http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_User_Query

Basically, if it is a one to one relationship with a user and a CPT, and 
that CPT only contains info about the user, you should simply put the 
extra fields you need on the user's profile page. (The caveat is the 
same as the metaboxes. If you require external plugins to tweak then a 
CPT my be the only option)


Cheers,
Ben

Again thanks, but doesn't work for us.  We've built a lot of functionality around custom post types that doesn't apply to users, at least not at this time, and maybe not ever.

YMMV.

You can create posts programatically using wp-cli [1]:

many at a time:

$ wp generate posts --count=1000

or one by one:

I'm building a theme, and I'd like to setup a few vars/consts that my
theme templates can access.

Would the theme's functions.php file be the best spot to set/define these?

Sorry if stupid question.

Subject: [wp-hackers] hooking into the media uploader
Message-ID: <5024c79f.1038.608.5901@ofir.dk>

Hello wp-hackers,

I am working on a solution where I would like to synchronize my 
wordpress media-library with a medialibrary on a external server, 
without using a cron job.

What I am looking for is some kind of hook that I can hook into and a 
my script that copies the media item to a new server. Same goes for 
deleting and editing.

I think i could use "add_attachment, delete_attachment and 
edit_attachment", but i cant seem to get the current attachment item.

Have any of you worked with those hooks, or something similar, that 
could elaborate on how to work with it? Or maybe im thinking this all 
wrong and you have a better idea? :)

Thanks in advance

Steffen Mortensen

Hello Steffen,

When hooking on "add_attachment, delete_attachment and edit_attachment", 
you get an argument which is the post ID (an attachment is a post 
actually) needed to retrieve the file URL or path for example (with 
get_attached_file function).

    function sample_function($post_id) {
         $path = get_attached_file($post_id);
    }
    add_action('delete_attachment', 'sample_function');


You don't need anything else imho.

Lionel

You can define those in your theme's functions.php, though you might also consider defining some functions there instead.

Message-ID: <502519A8.3040909@rotorised.com>

Hey hackers!

I've just unleashed Skeletor to the world:
https://github.com/rmccue/Skeletor

Skeletor is a super simple tool for managing a WP Skeleton-based site.
It's designed to help you out with creating a new site and more tools
will be added soon to manage further bits of it.

This is very much an early version of Skeletor. I'd love to hear any
feedback on it, including feature requests. I've got a few ideas of my
own, but haven't yet implemented them (I only wrote Skeletor this
afternoon).

Hopefully some of you find this useful!

Thanks,

I appreciate all of the dialog on my problem, I've read through it all
several times this morning trying to understand the pros and cons of the
various points made.  A couple of comments:

I decided to implement players as their own CPT instead of an extension of
the user profile because of my experience using WordPress to manage a swim
team.  For the swim team plugin I've written (wp-swimteam), parents
register as users and then add their swimmers to the system.  It is a huge
challenge to get parents to use the WordPress Dashboard.  We may not think
twice about logging into it and performing any number of Dashboard actions
but based on my experience working with 500+ swim team families, a lot of
them simply don't understand or more frequently, are lazy and don't want to
be bothered with entering and maintaining their information although they
like to complain when it is wrong.  They want someone to do it for them.

Based on the 5-6 soccer teams we've been involved with over the years, I've
taken the approach with that a team manager is usually responsible for
maintaining the relevant data and making sure it is available to all
players and parents.

Using a CPT for the players I can certainly allow a parent to register as a
user and give them author rights to their player so they can maintain their
player's information but quite frankly, I am pretty sure I don't want to.
 Each player currently has a profile sheet for college recruiting purposes
(a few of the players are probably good enough to play in college but not
all of them but the club asks all players to have a profile sheet).  Think
of it as a resume of sorts.  Some of the parents have taken quite a bit of
creative license with accomplishments which all had to be edited back out
of the documents.  I don't think we'd want to hand over authorship rights
to a player's profile.  In theory it would be wonderful.  In practice I
can't imagine what sort of nonsense would get posted.

So I am back noodling on Ben's suggestion to also define the Roster as a
custom post type instead of a taxonomy like I've currently done.  I am
still not clear that it will help uniquely identify a team/player/roster
combination that I would like to maintain.

I am currently playing with Posts 2 Posts, does anyone have any experience
with CPT-onomies?   http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cpt-onomies/ It
looks similar but not exactly like Posts 2 Posts.

Years should probably be postmeta, not a taxonomy. Why? Because you
probably want to sort/order by years at some point.

Anything that is "data" about the post should be meta. Anything that
is a "grouping" of several posts should be a taxonomy.

Thanks Otto,

That's a valuable tip, once and a while I stuck on this concept.

I'm using parent/child cpt for same name pages, is that wrong? I found out 
that links stay clear though backend can get crowded.

Example:

[-] 2010 Conference
    - Overview
    - Atendees

[-] 2011 Conference
    - Overview
    - Atendees
    - Special events

You can even create a pretty interface for those "global variables",
it's quite easy:

Subject: [wp-hackers] set/modify the auto-incrementing ID of the wp_postmeta.
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2OexmvfEb4oXZZ8jEKuyTxbxtXSk5XnRqq9HN3neugnA@mail.gmail.com>

Is it possible to internally set/modify the auto-incrementing ID of a
mysql table, specifically the wp_postmeta?

First, let me tell, where is this need coming from?

I want to see how WP/mysql performs in a condition where wp_postmeta
has millions of records. My goal is to find out if there is an issue
as far as performance is concerned with an ever growing wp_postmeta or
not.

To test this, I will use the 70,000 posts in our current wp_posts
table ( of our non-live site ) and write a little PHP script that puts
1000 dummy records in the wp_postmeta for each every post in the
wp_posts, bringing the record count in the wp-postmeta somewhere in
the neighbourhood of  70M records. Then I will turn on the debug_bar
plugin and compare the SQL speed to the before values. With this test,
I am hoping to see enough info that will allow me to pass judgements
as to if I should use/abuse the wp_postmeta all the way ( the wp way )
or if I should explore the options of creating seperate tables for
various CPTs and CFs ( the pods way ).

Now back to the original question.. Once I put those records and done
with the test, I will need to delete them.

delete from wp_postmeta where meta_id > ? would do the job instantly.

but my next wp-postmeta id would be something like 70M+1. Is there a
way at that moment to tell mysql, hey forget about that 70m that was
temporarily put in and start from where you were?

Yes, "ALTER TABLE wp_postmeta AUTO_INCREMENT = ###", however, I would
still just recommend you backup the database, run your test, and then
restore from the backup instead. It's easier, probably quicker, and
works the same way nearly every time no matter what you're testing
(unless it also involves files on disk).

change the storage engine to InnoDB so you won't have table-level locking

For fun, test some Meta Queries - they are the slowest part of WP

Well, I started putting the records in. It puts a 1000 postmeta record
per second. But it times out every other 800K or so. By the time, it
finishes, it will time out at least a 100 times! What do you guys do
in a situation like this. how do you make sure that the PHP script
does not time out or when it times out, it retriggers itself? What
technique do you guys use so that you do not find your self giving the
script a go 100 times manually every 30 min or so?

This is what I got before the WP she-bang gets loaded.
set_time_limit (3600);

But that does not seem to get honored.

If you're executing the script via a web server, chances are you're
running into a max_execution time or similar timeouts in the server
stack itself.

the most common method to resolve this is to run the script on the
command line, and use set_time_limit(0); (unlimited).

I had the same problem regarding the admin for WordPress and having users
login to manage certain pieces of content. I went the route of creating
custom forms, leaving Gravity Forms behind. Granted they are not robust as
my needs are simple.

Once logged in an attendee can do the following:

   - Manage their schedule <http://bmxraceevents.com/attendees/zanematthew> --
   An attendee is a user and they are related to many "events", a custom post
   type.
   - Create events <http://bmxraceevents.com/events/new> -- A custom post
   type, associated with a "venue" another custom post type. This is
   also integrated into the WordPress admin.
   - There's also "inplace edit" for "admins", which is similar to scribu's
   front end edit <http://scribu.net/wordpress/front-end-editor>

If you're running it via the command line, the time limit should be set
to unlimited automatically. (Unless WP sets it, but I can't recall it
doing so.)

Ah nice, I didn't realise that, I could've sworn although the default
is 0, that environments sharing php.ini between server and cli
contexts would use the php.ini setting.
Seems I'm mistaken :)

Wasn't there a trick to run the shell commands right from within a php
page thru the use of a back tick char?
would that do the trick of starting a php process from within a php
page rather than going to the console and starting it manually?

PHPmyadmin query results.. I'm not done yet, ( the goal is 70M recs,
now it's around 13M)
but I wanted to share the results...

SELECT * FROM  `wp_postmeta` LIMIT 0 , 30
Showing rows 0 - 29 (~12,896,9541 total, Query took 0.0003 sec)

I find it difficult to believe.
How is it possible that a server can pull  12M records in 0.0003 sec?
Is this phpmyadmin data on how long the query tool reliable?

i'd like to hear your opinions on this.

It pulled only 30 records. Much more believable. :)

to test actual use cases:

1) query records by post_id or meta_key, both have indexes
2) JOIN posts and post_meta and compare meta_values (unindexed, sorts on disk, slow)

No. There's no good way to run a long running process via a web
request. Nor would you really want to do so. Loads of bad karma lies
down that path, friend.

If this is a one time thing, then just run it from a direct shell. Fast, easy.

If this is something generic that you'll have to do repeatedly from a
web page, then rearchitect so that it keeps track of state, pulls
small numbers at a time, and refreshes every so often to start the
process back up to thus continue where it left off.

Doesn't support IE7.Regardless of whether you or I like the browser; a large number of companies/organisations/educational-institutes still use this browser.
Last year we answered an RFI where we were asked to support Netscape4/6.
Apparently the client didn't actually care about NS4/6, but wanted to weed out the companies who would complain about Enterprise's not upgrading everyone to the latest version of every bit of software they use.23 companies didn't make it through to the RFP process on their answer to that question alone.

On top of that any CMS that changed its layout / workflow significantly within a year of a previous release was deemed to be ruled out.
I understand the desire to change these things; but honestly, there needs to be some benefit to the people using and choosing the software - otherwise we're just re-painting!

I love this post; real-world pragmatic concerns, something I feel too many people dismiss or outright ignore.

That said, Kevinjohn I'm curious if your NS4/6 fans appreciated that their desire to support outdated systems should also increase their costs over update of browsers, possibly up to 3x and maybe even 10x?  I completely agree that technologists should be more willing to embrace real-world considerations, but I often find that clients want this but also want the same prices they would get if sites were simply coded for modern browsers, and I find that hypocritical.  

Supporting legacy browsers is not that different from writing mobile apps on multiple mobile platforms; it's a lot more complex and a lot more costly to make it all work. Have you found these companies who expect legacy support to be willing to pay significantly more to get it?

Technically, it's only those actually coding, documenting, patching and
testing who *might* be engaged in re-painting, and certainly everyone can
find a much more respectful way of discussing their efforts and
contributions.

I made a fork of Redactor with commits made since the license change

Any interest in collaborating on moving that code base forward under the
old GPL v 2, or later and MIT license? Or, if you prefer, feel free to take
it and roll with it. Many will benefit from keeping this excellent work
open.

Some do, some don't.I am always upfront about our costs: supporting IE6 or IE7 will add 1 year of my mortgage to your cost - flat rate, regardless of size of project.
The specific company that asked the NS4/6 question had over 50,000 employees ; and was for an intranet CMS RFI.They weighed up the cost of supporting the development in older browsers browsers; versus the cost of upgrading over 50,000 computers (in over 100 languages and 200 countries) and all the support questions it would raise. For every year they supported the older browsers, they saved more money than I'll make in my lifetime.
We geeks sometime forget that upgrading, heck CHANGE, has a cost associated with it (time / money / support / training ). Sometimes the cost of doing nothing, is less than the cost of change.

(hopefully didn't de-rail this thread)

To me that's how it should be; rational evaluation of the costs and benefits, and recognition that choosing one approach may have different cost profiles than another.  It's the ones who expect legacy support without acknowledging the cost that are problematic.

Completely agreed.

Well put!  It's one of the disadvantages of our industry's 
non-traditional job experience.  We just aren't exposed to that side of 
the business world.  Targeting and developing for small businesses 
exposes us to only aspect of business in general.  There are costs small 
businesses just don't have any concept of.  So you need to know who your 
client is targeting and if their main market is people who have IE 7 - 
you can't ignore it no matter what your thoughts on it are.  You also 
can't choose a Theme/Framework that doesn't support it either. It makes 
design and dev work more complicated and messy, but that's what the real 
world is after all.

On the flip side, the business guys often forget that there's a cost
to maintaining old hardware, available vendors dropping like flies
leaving the remaining ones the ability to jump up prices, lack of
flexibility to expand rapidly, exposure to way more serious security
vulnerabilities, additional companies not willing to even work with
you (such as the 23 companies mentioned in your situation earlier).
Those costs are often even higher than the upgrade would be, they are
way less predictable, and much of it can't even be measured (nor can
the benefits of performing the upgrade).

Also, regardless of their decision to push back the upgrade, it
absolutely *will* happen eventually (it has to), and you've just
pushed your company back on progress that your competitor now has an
opening on (i.e. the other guys are hiring 30% less staff because
their internal support web apps are web 2.0 optimized making them
several times easier to use and several times easier to train for, and
obviously several times easier for the developers to write and
maintain). Also, if you expect the company to grow, the costs to
perform the upgrade are only going to increase. Then again, not
performing the upgrade might just guarantee that the company isn't
going to grow now.

Maybe it is a good decision though if the company is on the decline
already though...

Actually Bryan,
I'm going to disagree.I've yet to meet a "business person" in a company above the SME level that doesn't know there's a cost to supporting legacy.The difference I usually find is that none of them were prepared for just how fast technology would change, and be deprecated.
One of my largest clients is still using an older version of IE because the cost of rewriting all their VBscript/com modules that feed their BI is astronomical. But aside from that the point is, it actually works. 
> "Security Vulnerabilities."
I hear these all the time, but it ignores a sizeable percentage of smaller-CMS work once you move away from small clients: intranets.

> "additional companies not willing to even work with you"
That doesn't really happen; in fact I'd wager it only happens with small companies, who are small enough to act on some foolish principle, or because they don't have the capacity to fullfil the request as stated. I've never worked at a sizeable agency nor an SI where money couldn't convince them to pitch for the work. I have worked with companies who have turned down work/pitches but I've never seen it on a technicality along the lines of "I have to code for IE7? I have to remember what I did 3 years ago, with only the whole internet to use as a reference, and I only get paid double??". The "23 companies" I mentioned all completed the RFI and wanted to work, they just moaned or wrote such a bad answer that they weren't considered. RFI's are under partial-DNA so excuse the lack of specifics, but one fairly reputable company wrote "What's Netscape?". The RFI question was there to see who would charge them, who would charge them and moan, and who would tell them to upgrade !!


> Also, regardless of their decision to push back the upgrade, it absolutely *will* happen eventually (it has to)
Absolutely AN upgrade will happen, but maybe not THAT upgrade.
I have a large multinational for a client thats going straight from IE6 to IE10 in October.It was going to move to IE7 about 4 years ago (before my time), when they heard the IE8 rumblings, so held off, and no sooner was IE8 about to come out and the rewritten-from-the-ground-up IE9 was in alpha. And it wasn't available for WinXP anyway. Now they're planning the migration from WInXP/IE6 > Win8/IE10.
I have no doubt that upgrade will be painful, and costly, but not as costly as going for WinXP/IE6 > WInXP/IE7 > WinVista/IE7 > WinVista/IE8 > Win7/IE9 > Win8/IE10. Thats a browser or OS upgrade every 18 months for the last 9 years; in a place where migration company wide to a new version of either can take up to 18 months.
Thats something else we geeks and tech lovers fail to grasp. Not every upgrade needs to happen, as long as one does happen eventually.

> Also, if you expect the company to grow, the costs to perform the upgrade are only going to increase. 
Uh no, definitely not. At least, not in a linear fashion.Thats why companies put off changing technology. Although they are deferring the cost, they are also hoping that the 'next' upgrade will remove that cost.Say going from IE6 > IE8. They skipped all the IE7 support calls. Going from WInXP/IE7 to Win7/IE9 skipped Vista entirely. Thats a huge saving :)
Ignoring browsers a sec, imagine a software release where the upgrade introduced a bug. You couldn't rollback once it was applied, but you'd have to wait for another release to fix it.By deferring the upgrade until you've seen if it works in the real world you don't have the cost of upgrading twice that early adopter did.Think of all the people who move to the new version of WordPress only after the 3.x.1 bug fix release comes out :)
I can give a few WordPress examples off list if you'd like to chat. Don't want to derail this topic any further than we already have.

> Then again, not performing the upgrade might just guarantee that the company isn't going to grow now.
Again, thats geek thinking.Looking at the FTSE100 top 10 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index ) I can speak for a fact about 6 of those companies.Not one of them was within 2 versions of the latest browser or 1 version of the latest operating system when our paths crossed. None of them used Chrome, or Firefox or Safari.Not one of them has not grown an incredible amount in the last 5 years.
Ignoring security vulnerabilities, which I can't speak to, what are the POSITIVES for a company of a particular size to upgrade all it's staff's browsers?Text-shadows? CSS3? responsive design? None of that matters if a website can load and display data.That isn't a good Return on Investment.
I'm not saying that upgrading browsers/os/cms is not a great idea. Ofc course it is, but then I'm presuming everyone here who thinks "thou shalt upgrade" is on the latest version of PHP too, right?
And thats the crux of the issue. We all believe that upgrading is the way forward, and we want our clients and potential clients to do the same or we judge them harshly. But we make the same judgement calls ourselves, and choose to take some upgrades and ignore some of the others. We do cost analysis and risk assessments (though we may not call them that); and we choose to upgrade or CHANGE when we think the return on investment will be big and the risk will be small.
I know I come across as a bit of a "Richard" sometimes, but it did make me laugh that NOT one person at the groundbreakingly wonderful WPUK in Edinburgh last month had upgraded to PHP 5.4 (released 13th June), but everyone who heard that I hadn't upgraded to 3.4 (also released June 13th) told me that I should always upgrade technology ASAP. And thats the problem: we think favourably of browsers, HTML5, responsive something, whatever todays buzzword is, CSS3 and out favourite CMS... we start to treat it with different rules/guidelines than we claim to live by.

Hi all,

I have a question about query_posts. I need to retrieve all the articles having a given custom field associated to them, but limited to a specific time range. Is there any way of achieving this without adding a filter to posts_where?

Thank you

As Bill points out, there's not a way to do this in core yet. I've
overcome this previously by adding an 'updated' custom field to every
post with a MySQL-formatted date string whenever the post is updated
(or created, depending on the use-case). You can then use that in a
meta_query like this:

$meta_query = array(
	array(
		'key'     => 'my_key',
		'value'   => 'my_value'
	),
	array(
		'key'     => 'updated',
		'value'   => date( 'Y-m-d H:i:s' ),
		'compare' => '>=',
		'type'    => 'DATETIME'
	)
) );

The 'value' argument for the date can of course be something else such
as date(  'Y-m-d H:i:s', strtotime( '-3 days' ).

Thank you guys. Hopefully the new wp query extension will be added to 3.5 before it ships. In the meanwhile I think the custom field workaround is a reasonable compromise ;)

Is it OK to index the meta_value field of the wp_postmeta?
According to phpmyadmin, meta_id, post_id and meta_key are already indexed.
I'm sure there must be a good reason for meta_value to come not indexed.

But what if you want indexed.
With 32M recs in it now, I'm getting no response from the phpmyadmin
when I query meta_value for a specific value.
post_id, meta_id takes about 0.0X secs. querying meta_val simply times out.

That brought the question, well, should we indexed the table? The only
field not indexed there is the meta_val.
Even if you go say to that? well, how am I gonna index that huge data.
It's already 5Gb.

For sure, it will time out, if I try the running it from the command
line 9 which I do not know how to begin with ), how long would it
take? Will I be able to stop the process ( when started from the
command line ) in case it slows down database server  effecting my
live web site.

You shouldn't be querying meta_value for a specific value without also
querying meta_key (and probably post_id) for a specific value as well.
And even then, the limit clause should be pretty strict so as to only
pull the first hundred or so.

WordPress's DB is architected to optimally do the kinds of things WP
does. WP is designed to pull posts and the meta associated with them
(thus the query in meta has a strict set of post_id's to check for),
or it's designed to pull posts based on meta_key=meta_value (thus the
query in meta has a meta_key to check for and then it can search on
the meta values for the comparator).

When you start doing direct queries, then the DB may not be optimized
for your specific case. But then you wouldn't expect it to be, and
that's not really what you're testing against, is it?

This is not 100% accurate. You can create an index, but you need to specify the length. The index won't speed up LIKE clauses, but most meta queries are using WHERE often with '='.

CREATE INDEX postmeta_prefix ON wp_postmeta (meta_value(20));

Subject: [wp-hackers] "Dealing with people" taxonomies, users or links?!
Message-ID: <006101cd7a56$1082dc00$2200a8c0@TITA>

I have set custom content for manage events, conferecens, files etc eveything working fine and neat, now I'm struggling with this:

Events (post types) that need set speakers, while these speakears are quite the same on regular basis. There is need for a mini curriculum with picture and text, linked in site link etc

Not really sure what can be done, so I'm considering this:
  a.. Set data as WP users, though I can't figure out how to link them to a post (I suppose creating a metabox for retrieve users and keep them as a metadata, but maybe this is wrong?)
  b.. "Taxonomies Extra Fields" (http://en.bainternet.info/2012/wordpress-taxonomies-extra-fields-the-easy-way) never tried this but seems suitable. 
  c.. Maybe a misused approach but set a Link Category and keep people there :) (not sure how could link the data to a post though)

I would like to know how you are handling this data type in WP.

Thanks!

Hi Diana

Ideally you'd want to link the two data types in some way.

The way I see it is that speakers will not need to add content to the
website or administrate it. Therefore creating a custom post type for the
speakers will be a better option as you'll be able to add ass much
information and fields to the speaker custom post type as you like.

Then use the http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/posts-to-posts/ plugin to
link the two CPT's.

Some more information can be found here:

I use both, here's how.

User -- Typical "wp user"
Events -- Have a taxonomy called "attendees"

When a User Attends an event the user login is copied as a taxonomy, so
yes, each Attendee is basically a duplicate user name. If you navigate to
my Schedule page: http://bmxraceevents.com/attendees/zanematthew.

Doing it this way, does seem "hacky", but worked quickly for me and allowed
me to treat attendees as taxonomies, which at the time is what I wanted to
do.

Note Attendees don't manage the their Schedule from the wp admin, instead
they can manage it once logged into the site.

You may also be able just to store the event id (post id) in the
wp_usermeta table with the user id.

Hi Diana and Dwain,

Dwain's suggestion is how I've been doing it - speakers (or "people") are a custom
post type, as are events (and other things).

The posts2posts plugin is great for connecting them but you do need to know a
bit of PHP to pull this off.

I'm using WPAlchemy (http://www.farinspace.com/wpalchemy-metabox/)
to create custom metaboxes on the editor screen for people and events,
which simplifies the process of editing the custom fields.

Feel free to send me a personal message if you want to learn more.

Here's an example of people and events in use:

https://heydaybooks.com/event/reading-from-lunch-bucket-paradise/
(This is an online bookstore where, if you click on the author's name, you
go to see what books they've written, and can then purchase them, as
well as the events they've spoken at)

Feel free to contact me off-list if you have any additional questions.

Cheers,

Anca.

Thank you,

Seems an interesting approach to set users as taxonomy as we can add some 
info on taxonomy description and also share between various post types 
abroad.

One point you made me figure out is the cross reference around the site, 
seems tricky but help content to keep related someway :)

Thanks Anca,

I'm trying everything to see what seems more easy to use and keep. I will 
try set this data as post type by now, makes sense: in future we can convert 
those post types into users profiles someway I think.

Until now I tried taxonomy shared on post types, quite simplistic but I 
can't figure out how to display a person profile without posts added to (WP 
default is as 404), so this approach is not too good, also will need another 
script/plugin, hard to add special data around etc


WPAlchemy seems good, but found Bill Erickson' script 
(https://github.com/jaredatch/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress) 
more documented, luckily I even found an example on implementing post type 
selection in this script 
(https://github.com/jaredatch/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress/issues/168) 
though now need to dive to set it as checkboxes instead dropdown list.

Message-ID: <CAMg3evHf6nu-Ar7F+F7NzWP7kRYyRjGOoTXeFMyfpbpJ-6TpqQ@mail.gmail.com>

I fear I am dealing with a "can't see the forest through the trees"
situation but I've been staring at this problem off an on this afternoon
with no progress.  I am trying to use the quick_edit_custom_box action with
two custom post types.  One works, one does not and I can't figure out why.
 I am using this simple action:

add_action( 'quick_edit_custom_box', function() { error_log(__LINE__) ; },
10, 2 );

In addition to not working for one of my CPTs, it also doesn't fire for
posts or pages either.  Anyone have any suggestions as to why it would fire
in one case but not three others?  There isn't anything interesting in the
error log that provides any clues.

Thanks,

Mike

Subject: [wp-hackers] 1 taxonomy on 2 different custom post types
Message-ID: <502FDE0A.5080202@gmail.com>

Hello,

Is it at all possible to have 1 custom taxonomy on 2 different custom 
post types, and have them filtered.

I have 2 different custom post types that both use the same taxonomy, 
and I would like to do url filtering.

One is called "Draw Results" and the other "Ball Statistics", I would 
like the below urls so show only posts in the custom post type in the 
url that are in the taxonomy "Game".

http://www.domain.com/draw-results/game/lotto
http://www.domain.com/ball-statistics/game/lotto

This was working when was only 1 custom post type, but since I have 
added a 2nd the above links dont filter, they show all posts in the 
taxonomy regardless of which custom post type they are in.

Thanks
Daniel.

I have no clue what Sparrow just did to that email - let's try again:

www.domain.com/draw-results/?game=lotto

I don't really want ugly urls like that I would like to use the urls I 
mention in my initial post instead, is this not possible ?

Your might be able to use add_rewrite_rule() although it may conflict with other URLs, not sure. I rarely use the "official" approach because it requires rewrite rules to be refreshed.

What I like to use is the 'parse_request' hook at modify $wp->query_args.  You can find an example that should meeting your needs here and it can give you a little insight into what URLs translate to internally:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Sort of virtual post_type gathering its informations
	from an other database
Message-ID: <CA+sFoLrHRcUYVuHk2cJ4M_nrOotk2R996koJ-noQRyMWuPYE3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I have the case of a big external database containing records that I need
to display like regular posts. I get the databse as daily dumps.
It has so many records that importing the records into wordpress as regular
"post type" isn't a solution.

I need to search into those records and then display the results. That part
is ok.

I then need to display each result on its own page when clicked. This
"virtual single posts" are going to be accessible from an url endpoint,
lets say http://mysite/virtual/my-post-name

How would you suggest handling the display of such a records from an other
database like if it was a regular post ?

Regards.

Message-ID: <CAEJabWikUWTk-z1=EpFHn9w4jiTgktKOQ6Z4H2xaP9eNK9V_TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm working on a project where I need to store PHP code snippets in meta
for a custom post type.

I'll be using a textarea field for entry in deference to wp_editor (mostly
due to wanting to use a syntax highlighter).

Just wondering whether I need to sanitize that data in some way before
storing it in the database. I don't know if some form of kses is already
being run on custom fields and whether there's a security/stability
argument to be made about storing or not storing code snippets in this way.

Appreciate any insight,

Drew

WordPress automatically converts double quotes to sixty sixes and ninety
nines but I need to post code content in my articles and don't want
quote characters converted. Is there some way to disable the default
character conversion?

It's a filter you can turn off.

remove_filter('the_content', 'wptexturize');

OR a better way to fix that is to wrap the code you are putting into 
your post in any of these tags:
<pre>, <code>, <kbd>, <style>, <script>, <tt>

or try putting it in:
[code] [/code]

That should fix the problem for you..

I wasn't sure if [code][/code] got added to core or not. The codex 
definitely does reference it in the wptexturize() article.  I've had it 
via plugin forever, but a quick set of tests shows that naked WP core 
doesn't have that shortcode.

(And btw wordpress.com does of course  have [code][/code].)

Not when you are putting it in the database, but DEFINITELY any time you 
display it.

Sending it through esc_html() before display would be good.

Thanks for this, I gave it a try...

I did a var_dump on $wp->query_vars outside of the if statement in the 
function you wrote and this is the result.

Oops, I think it should have been:

'game' => $matches[2],

I tested on a local site but had to change for your site and screwed it up because yours CPTS and my test CPTs are different.  See updated code at:

https://gist.github.com/3390496

Also, why are you testing it with these URLs?

I'm pretty confident that this is not the case for us, and I don't see 
how it can be the case for anyone without somehow allowing the web user 
to impersonate a shell user, which would surely not be sensible at all.

Is this just wrong? Or have I misread it? Or is something clever going

Wouldn't running the db on one server and then having multiple front-ends as well as a load balancer work for this?  It seems like that would be a good way, I am also looking into similar scenarios.

yes - but if you need many front end web servers, you may need MySQL slaves as well.

It's something clever, called the WP_Filesystem. :)

Basically, the WP_Filesystem supports a few different methods of
writing files, depending on what sort of functionality you have
available and what sort of method by which your system is running.

If the PHP code is running in what's known as "setuid" mode, where the
PHP process is running as the same user who owns the PHP files
themselves, then the WP_Filesystem will use the "direct" mode for
writing files, and it will simply write them out directly. Because the
owner of the file matches the PHP process owner, then the files are
written with the correct user.

For any other case, it either asks for FTP credentials, or can use
secure-ftp or ssh2 credentials (depending on the setup), to
essentially perform a loopback connection to the server. Thus, while
the PHP process may be running as "apache" or "nobody" or something,
it will connect back to the server using, say, FTP, and give the
proper login, then write the files via that connection. Each of the
supported WP_Filesystem methods is in its own
class-wp-filesystem-*.php file in the wp-includes directory, if you
want to examine them.

If you're not using the WP_Filesystem, then you're correct in that
files can be written with incorrect ownership. In the case of the
image uploader, this is the case. But for doing plugin/theme/core
upgrades, WordPress uses the WP_Filesystem to get the ownership
correct.

When you do this make sure you are taking into account media uploads, 
plugin installs/update/etc. WordPress by default stores all the files 
locally in the wp-content folder. Your multiple front end servers will 
need to be able to share that

You MAY need db slaves, yes, but before you start scaling with HyperDB 
and multiple slaves, make certain that you actually see the need.  You 
should only switch to multiple DB servers if you have a tuned MySQL 
server that is still being overwhelmed despite caching. Having a 
dedicated MySQL server will get you a long way.  Then the next step 
would likely be a separate write server and a single r/w slave.

You'll probably find Mark Jaquith's presentation on scalable WordPress 
from last year's WordCamp SF interesting.
Good stuff:

Aha! It's that thing I've never used! Thanks for the explanation - very 
useful.

It looks like this could be easily overridden, too, by setting FS_METHOD 
(or using the filesystem_method filter) and including a new, 
appropriately-named class in a plugin? Except there's a comment at 
wp-admin/includes/file.php:844 -
> Please ensure that this is either 'direct', 'ssh', 'ftpext' or 
> 'ftpsockets'
Which makes it sound like that's not possible?

Thanks for sharing that.

Initially I put a few of my WordPress installations in svn like Mark
recommends and installed them on the server by checking them out. Then I
used the admin interface to upgrade and it corrupted my svn working copy
so I couldn't check the changes back in to svn.

Also on another attempt one of my users used the admin tool to change
his theme and the files got out of sync with the repo then too.

So now I have a bunch of WordPress installations that initially were in
svn and are now just corrupt and useless svn working copies.

If you check your WordPress installation into a VCS what is the
recommended strategy for upgrading it? Can you disable administrative
functions such as in-browser upgrades, installing themes, upgrading
plugins, etc. in the config file somehow? Is that what you're supposed
to do?

I've written plugins that disable all of those messages and version 
checks (but that was harder to do than you might think and I'm not sure 
I like my final result).

However, it can also just be handled as a training issue.  Having only a 
very limited number of admins able to take those actions helps a lot.  
After all, it's best if admin accounts are used only for those types of 
administrative actions.  Lower level accounts should be used for your 
posting needs.

Monitoring what's changed on your servers is a good idea in any case.  A 
VCS can show you that easily.  You just need to commit the changes you 
approve.

It's possible. Look at the function WP_Filesystem around line 798. But
you'd also need to use the filesystem_method_file filter to return the
path to the file that contains your appropriately named class.

 /wp-admin/ can be forced to be only on one server. So when you make
change on this server all other copies are replicated (for example
with resync+crontab).

Oopps sorry I was in a rush to leave for work and I have copy and pasted 
the urls off the wrong post, meant to do the ones that you mentioned.

The problem I had before has gone, but I think there is a problem still 
but not with the code you wrote I believe this would work, I think its 
to do with my register_taxonomy, have pasted it here 
http://pastebin.com/YieR47eQ.

On the draw results page everything works just as it should on the ball 
statistics page it doesn't.

I can only think that its down the rewrite part in the $args for the 
register taxonomy, as I would like the urls to be 
http://www.domain.com/ball-statistics/lotto and 
http://www.domain.com/draw-results/lotto.

Draw Results works perfectly and am sure the Ball Statistics will also 
once have fixed the rewrite part as I think that's the issue.

ball-statistics cpt I get :-
array(1) { ["attachment"]=> string(5) "lotto" }

draw-results cpt I get :-
array(2) { ["post_type"]=> string(12) "draw-results" ["game"]=> 
string(5) "lotto" }

Thanks
Daniel.

You are over-thinking it.  Set the slug to just 'game' and the code I gave you should work.

P.S. BTW, there are numerous ways to route URLs in WordPress. This is just one way.

Its ok its because one url had a / on the end the other didn't so one 
worked one didn't fixed it now.

Hi John,

I've been part of two projects in which we have done this.

We've used a setup like this:

Loadbalancer which sends requests to 1+N webservers. The webservers are
using a mounted shared filesystem for wp-content/ data. We've used one
DB server with loads of memory.

Currently we're experimeting with this type of setup using
virtual-machines on a grid, no conclusive data on it yet though.

The first project was an external website linked to a tv program and had
to survive massive peaks of traffic in a short period of time, the other
is an intranet with in worst case scenario > 30K users at one time
hitting the homepage, but mostly less.

Some hints & tips

- Type of users: mostly read or both read/write (caching possibilities)
- DB is still single point of failure!
- Depending on the filesystem and how you implement the mount it could
be a single point of failure and cause performance headaches.
- Keep the total amount of http request as low as you can (performance)

Hope this helps,

ps: Would be awesome to have a group of WordPress 'big projects' get
together and share tips 'n tricks. My guess is that wordpress.com is not
the only big website using WordPress ;)

We worked around a shared file system by adapting WordPress to upload
into Rackspace CDN (CloudFiles), rather than WP-Content. This worked
really well for us, giving redundancy as well as the added benefit of
the content delivery network.

We're also experimenting with a similar load balanced setup in the
Rackspace cloud, more than happy to share data and advice.

Gav.

I've written a plugin which does this automatically for Amazon S3.
It's working fine on my test install, but I just want to do a little
more testing before releasing it. If anyone has a use for it, just
lemme know and I can send you a copy of it.

If you're at the point where you're considering HyperDB or some form of
sharding or master-slave replication, I'd classify that as big.

Also, great idea.

I'm looking for something that will conditionally store on S3 (and work on
multisite).

Mine is designed to work specifically with multi-site. It does
actually upload to the main server though first rather than bypassing
it. You then need to delete it from the main server afterwards, so
it's not an ideal solution.

If you look at the file URLs on http://ryanhellyer.net/ you will see a
number listed in the URLs. That number is the blog ID. You could setup
a separate CloudFront instance for serving each blogs files from a
different domain if you wanted. I haven't bothered with that step
though for my setup (too lazy to do new sub-domains for each site).

I'll upload my plugin somewhere later tonight and post back here with
the link (I don't have time right now as I'm at work).

Should I be hooking into something else to get this to work?

Same here.  I am looking to do a similar setup very soon as we are wrapping up a site that will be getting national TV coverage and would like to share my experiences with the community and also get feedback.

I'm also massively interested in this.

It would be beneficial for a lot of people to be able to discover how people have dealt with high traffic for their projects. A collective set of case studies alone would be helpful those having to venture down a similar path.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pagination wp_query variable bug?
Message-ID: <CAC3yCwrvR7TVEKN+KVukLAACOC6PY_HEir09Hoph-2F4tgO0=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a plugin that puts blog posts onto a page. (This means I use a
custom new WP_Query) It has been working great until recently a user put
attempted to set the page with blog posts as his static front page. Now all
of a sudden pagination doesn't work. It knows how many pages there should
be, but the ?paged=# url or /page/#/ url doesn't change from page 1. I dove
back into my code and here is what I've been using:

$paged = is_numeric(get_query_var('paged')) ? get_query_var('paged') : 1

I did a print_r of the $wp_query variable and it is showing that the
pagination variable is called 'page' on the static front page. On all
normal pages, the pagination variable is still 'paged'. I've adjusted my
code to check both 'page' and 'paged' to get the current page. I can't find
any documentation about why a static front page would use the 'page'
variable and everything else would use the 'paged' variable. Do you think
this a bug?

Thanks,
Matt

I don't know the specifics of the problem, however the general
approach here strikes me as a bit nutty. :)

Basically, you're putting Posts onto a Page and then making that Page
into the Front. This is a bit of a backwards thinking sort of
approach, considering that the default behavior is to put the latest
Posts onto the Front by default. Seems like you'd be better served by
customizing the main query instead and not using a Page on Front at
all.

The query_var named 'paged' is only ever set for /page/2/ and up.

The Help on Reading Settings says: "You can choose what?s displayed on 
the front page of your site. It can be posts in reverse chronological 
order (classic blog), or a fixed/static page. To set a static home page, 
you first need to create two Pages. One will become the front page, and 
the other will be where your posts are displayed."

I guess the latter will be your 'normal' page. Yeah, fugs me up too.

I actually came across the same problem in a plugin I built recently. Took
me a while to figure it out, but I think what you're seeing is expected
behavior.

The paging setup for Pages ( the <!--nextpage--> quicktag, and the
endpoints /page/2, /page/3, etc to jump to the nth of those quicktags) is a
completely different thing from archive paging, so it makes sense to use a
different query variable.

In my plugin I got around that problem by adding a couple custom rewrite
rules that force that $paged query variable to be set, even if /page/2 is
part of an endpoint for a Page. Not a very elegant solution, but neither is
the whole concept of using a Page to hold an archive - that was just a
fallback I left in there for users who didn't want to bother setting up the
proper archive templates.

The email that WordPress sends when the user fills out the form to recover
your password is coming without the user clicks the link and reset the
password. Has anyone experienced this? Does anyone know how I can solve?

If the idea is to be able to use a regular-style template with the_title()
etc. you might want to investigate something along the lines of fetching a
dummy page from the database, then using the URL to fetch the virtual post
content, and inserting the title, date, content etc. into $wp_query->posts.
As long as you got the main values that affect display, it wouldn't have to
be perfect. That way you could use a straight clone of page.php and
everything would show up properly.

It might need to be updated with future versions but probably not that much
since a lot of plugins depend on the structure that wp_query currently has
for posts.

Have you considered that someone other than the user may be clicking the

Hello,

When going to the permalinks section in wp-admin the links are all prepended with index.php like so.  
When selecting any of the permalink settings it does not work at all and we get 404 on most pages.  The only way the site site will work is with the default permalink settings.

Does anyone have an idea of what this could be or how to begin debugging?

Thanks in advance,

Jeffrey Nolte

Check your server config. Ensure mod_rewrite exists and is enabled and 
AllowOverride All is set

Something I forgot to note is that we are using NGINX for server.  I will look into the equivalent of these settings in NGINX.

Thank you, unfortunately this did not work. I use the same configuration on just about all the WP sites we run and have never had an issue.  I will note this is an older site with many plugins (we disabled the majority of ones that we felt could conflict) which we are transferring from another host. 

Any ideas on a logical way to trace down this issue?

Thanks again

Did you flush your rewrite rules after you added the code to an mu-plugin? The old permastruct value will still be stored if you didn't.

Can you discuss the steps you've taken to debug, and provide more environment information?

On nginx, I always add this line of code somewhere (usually in a
plugin) to force the rewrites to not include the index.php file:

add_filter( 'got_rewrite', '__return_true' );

Next, because WordPress doesn't create nginx config files natively,
you'll need to do it yourself. These rules in the .conf file will do
the job:

if (!-e $request_filename) {
  rewrite ^/files/(.*)$ /wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$1 last;
  rewrite ^.*$ /index.php last;
}

You can leave off the ms-files one if you're not using a multi-site install.

Thank you Otto, That fixed the permalink issue but unfortunately I am still getting 404's on some of the requested content.  Any insight?

Message-ID: <CAFCSB_J361FO2zGK4gHF=NzRLSZ+VLTRqpqf7XXNFT5nMn=K_Q@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking to run several WordPress sites on a server. I'm talking like
100+. The way I see it each wordpress site is the same except for
wp-content directory, wp-config.php and the database. Therefore my thought
is to have one install where wp-config.pho can use a central database to
dynamically designate the correct db as well as a unique wp-content
directory based on the domain name.

How would this compare to more of a shared hosting type setup with vhosts
and a full copy of the wp source for each site. Any downside to my method
or other considerations I should be aware of?

I agree with Bryan, why would you not use a WordPress Multisite install? 
It already will handle what you are looking for and there is no reason 
to hack WordPress

I agree with the previous commenters, using Multisite is often very
easy for this sort of setup.

But if you do feel the need to roll your own, here's an alternate
approach sent to me the other day:

I should have figured someone would say this.

Of the numerous sites some themselves will need to be multisite for other
reasons. Also each site will need a unique users db.

It's certainly doable, though I'd put the logic in the config file 
rather than hitting the DB right away. You'll be fighting occasional 
plugins that have wp-content/plugins hard coded and so you'll have to 
look at each plugin you add.  For only 100 or so on one server, I'd 
still just consider unique installs. The file system is not over 
burdened and the sites are kept independent with no chance of one site's 
hack affecting another site. So I'd just keep it simple.

However, if you want to try something funky just to keep your install 
fresh.  You could always just create softlinks to the WP core 
subdirectories.  Then you aren't running any custom code and you're 
limiting your unique file list.  Updates will still have to update the 
web root for your 100 directories, but that's what scripts are for and 
you have no core hacks this way.

I would just use puppet or chef for something like this. As Brian said, the
file system should definitely be able to take 100 or so installs.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Permalink Rewrite Rules
Message-ID: <CAC3yCwrJr=wjbNfLnrmGi5V0mkYWu8-ZoXJd_OjH0_YZ5EosWQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to add my own custom url structure to my plugin that will allow
a specific url to access a different php file. For example, I want
www.domain.com/awesomeness/ should load a special php application in my
plugin: wp-content/plugins/myplugin/awesomeness.php. This 'awesomeness.php'
file will do its own thing and call exit().

I was trying to do all this using a rewrite rule, but I can't get it to
work. I've resorted to hooking the wp_loaded action and looking in
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] to see if it matches. The thing is, I still don't
want to allow users to make a page/post called 'awesomeness' because it no
longer is navigable. So it seems like I still need to add a custom
add_rewrite_rule().

Other thought: I've also thought about using add_feed() or
add_rewrite_endpoint() because then my awesomeness script would know what
page to work on. My current method will know what page to work on based on
what comes after /awesomeness/ (ex:
www.domain.com/awesomeness/my-normal-page/).

Sorry about being vague here. Please don't let my adding of a new tag
distract the conversation of how to add the custom permalink structure.
:-)  Does anyone have any experience doing odd rewrites or have any
articles about it?

Thanks,
Matt

Matt,

Would the template_redirect action work for what you're doing here?

Hi Ryan,

We've implemented something very similar.  We chose to go with single site because it's less complex than multisite and there are fewer plugin incompatibilities with single site.  We chose a shared architecture so that we can have one installation of a set of custom plugins with different databases and uploads directories.  

However, we handle all the admin so we don't give the end user access to plugins or themes.  We have a shared /wp-config.php which loads a "/wp-config-{domain}.php" file and then our uploads directories are "/wp-content/uploads/{domain}/."   I'm not sure this structure would work if you give end users full admin access.

Maybe it would help if you can better explain your use-cases?  Why will you have 100+ sites, and are they similar or different? What makes your situation unique?

Also there are multisite MultiNetwork plugins which let your sites make subsites.

Not that multisite is perfect for everyone, of course. Just something to consider :) (If you need to totally segregate your userbase, for example, I would be less inclined to use Multisite.)

This is a good deciding factor on why not to go MS.  Unique usernames is 
often the deal breaker.

Google will show you some base scripts you can use for mass updating.  
Look for for "WordPress mass update script" or EasyWPUpdate (Sheesh I 
need to update that to not mention 2.2 and earlier. It still works fine!)

It you end up being CPanel driven, send me a direct email and I can 
share some additional tools that I've not gotten into github yet.

Another way to keep track of your sites is with WP Remote. It is free 
and manages backups and updates. My shop uses it quite a bit

That's a fair point. My main concerns were disc space which is cheap anyway
and upgrades. Shouldn't be too hard to write a script to go though all the
sites automatically and prompt the built in updater to run.

There is a pretty big performance gain to be had from using the PHP APC opcode cache in terms of page load speed and requests per second. If you run that on a site with 100 separate WordPress installs that's potentially going to take up considerable RAM (lets say 30MB per site which could add up to around 3GB)

If all 100 sites shared the same core codebase than you might be able reduce this to 5MB per site (I'm plucking figures out of the air here, it depends on the themes used, plugins etc). This would work for multisite and should work for simlinks although I'm not sure if that's the same for both hard and soft links.

Then you've got the disk space benefits.

Also it's also much easier to keep track of one WordPress core instead of 100. By keep track I mean keep the core files in a local git repo so that you can track any changes made by a hack/virus etc.

So, many positives to running multiple sites from the same codebase, definitely worth investigating and I do hope you report back with your findings.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using WP cron from mu-plugins
Message-ID: <50364675.8080409@dxw.com>

We have a plugin in mu-plugins that needs to schedule a wp cron task. 
The recommended way to do this is from an activation hook, but 
(reasonably enough) mu-plugins don't have activation hooks.

The only way around this that I can think of is to have something check 
if the task is scheduled, and if it's not, schedule it. But that means 
we have to check for the task on every request, which sucks.

Does anyone know of a better way to do it?

The RAM benefit isn't something I had thought of. My assumption was its
still 100 copies of WP running even it it was just from one source and so
RAM footprint would be the same.

I think some legitimate points were made though about the viability of such
methods. Specifically on that post by otto, that article they talk about
managing all those symlinks. The more I think about it the more I question
if I can really trust that hack to hold up in production. And for what to
save some disc space? We all know that's cheap, Google gives me 10GB of
space for me email for free.

The RAM aspect does raise a potentially good point, I would have to look
into some hard figures of the diffrnece in the two methods and how much the
extra RAM does cost. And while I will agree it is easier to identify hacks
in one set of core files, it does also mean a hack affects all of the site.
Again some simple cron job tuning every night to verify MD5 hashes of every
core file against a known good file. If it doesn't match it could put the
site into maintenance mode like an upgrade, quarantine the file for my
review then replace it with a known good version and remove
the maintenance mode.

The issue was partially related to wp_nav_menu() exporting the incorrect permalinks.  Overall the permalinks are now working with the help from Otto.

You're better off running your install/upgrade routinse on the admin_init hook.

Yep, that's why you use the "plugin_db_version" option to effectively
store your plugin's database structure version and only run its
upgrade/install routine when you bump it.

And of course by "plugin_db_version" I mean "{your_plugin_name}_db_version".

The RAM benefits Simon mentioned apply only to when you are using an
opcode cache. Opcodes store the compiled PHP in RAM. If you aren't
running opcode caching, then this will not provide any benefit.
There's usually no reason not be running opcode caching though.

Thanks Peter,
I've never used that hook. In this unique case I think I'll stick with
wp_loaded because if my test matches I'm going to stop the normal WordPress
execution, and I don't need all the admin_bar and style execution. I'm glad
to see the template_redirect because I might incorporate that too in a
different area.

Another option would be to hook into an existing cron task that you know
will be wrong; say, the core update check (wp_version_check). Then,
check if your task has been added. If not, run it immediately and
schedule your new task. That gives you a maximum wait between when you
enable the plugin and when the task starts of the update checking time
(which is twicedaily).

Alternatively, hook into an admin hook and check there. Saves you
running it on every request, but is still run fairly often.

Message-ID: <CAFe_rR-WEOhse_xifP-JBOFpVe-YqHdYKasccbjzNC5zSZs=wA@mail.gmail.com>

For the second time in as many months, I've found myself needing to set a
few defaults when creating a custom post type. Setting a default title and
content are straight-forward using the default_content and default_title
filters.

Is there a simple way to set a default thumbnail when the "New Post" UI
appears for the user?

What I've done for now is put this code into my filter for default_content.
If $post->ID isn't 0, set_post_thumbnail(...) is called, along with any
other post meta I'm setting as defaults on the new CPT. This seems to work,
but feels like the hack that it is.

I've been tracing through core, but can't see any other hooks or filters
that would be a more appropriate place to do this. Does anyone have any
suggestions  or a better way to do this?

Thanks a lot!
Carl

Hi Folks,

I'm developing a new theme and am integrating a bunch of options in the Theme Customizer. It seems as though once you set a color using the color picker, there's no way to clear/remove/ unset it, is that right?

If you haven't saved your settings yet, you can hit the cancel button (though you'd lose all your other unsaved settings) -- but once it's saved, it's set in stone? Or am I missing something?

I think I'd disagree on both of those points.

First,  Linux will cache as much of the disk as it can in order to speed 
up disk IO.
If you do a
$   free -m
It will show you the columns Buffers and Cached.  This is your disk 
cache.   It isn't strictly a file cache, but a block cache of what is on 
the disk.  So if you have the files all come from one location rather 
than the same file in multiple locations, your cache will not be filled 
up with redundant information.  So there would be less swapping and a 
smaller cache could be more effective. (I still wouldn't bother with the 
softlinks unless you REALLY need it.)

As far as opcode caching, I would instead say try it! Once it is 
activated, there's no configuration and likely no maintenance.  So it is 
easy to do a test.  Chances are that you will get a boost to your site 
when it is under load. However, this is not always the case and I have 
seen opcode caching slow down a site that's server was already being 
overwhelmed and had no memory available.  So, while it's not a  
requirement, there are quite often benefits and some people consider 
configuring the server with a php accelerator a no-brainer decision.

BTW this subject is complicated somewhat by the fact that the opcode 
cache, used by an accelerator like APC to store the compiled bytecode of 
the php source, can also be used by plugins for Object Caching.  So 
articles like 
http://blog.cheapvps.co.uk/index.php/2012/03/28/testing-wordpress-the-importance-of-php-opcode-cache/ 
that show great graphs for the benefits of opcode caching are actually 
showing the benefits of an Object Caching plugin.  In reading that 
article I don't see that they are actually turning on and off the 
acceleration - just the object caching.

Hi Carl,

Take a look at the 'wp_insert_post_data' filter - that lets you look at the data 
submitted before the post is first added.

You could also add an action on "save_post"  as well.

We had the same problem Jessica. Quite frustrating. Ended up creating a 
custom "clear colors" button. I truly hope I'm just missing something 
because it seems silly there's no way to clear the selected color.
You can see how we did it on http://health-point-wp.webfactoryltd.com/ 
(click "customize theme" and then go to the colors section)

Im trying to rewrite a long file url to a shorter one.

Basically I have zips in a plugin folder I want to rewrite to
/downloads/filename.zip instead of
/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name/zips/filename.zip

Cant figure what im doing wrong.

Here is what I have 

define('ZT_URL', plugins_url('zips/' , __FILE__));

add_action('generate_rewrite_rules', 'cmm_add_rewrite_rules');

function cmm_add_rewrite_rules( $wp_rewrite ) {
        $new_rules = array(
                "^downloads/(.+)\.zip$" => ZT_URL .
$wp_rewrite->preg_index(1)
        );
        $wp_rewrite->rules = $new_rules + $wp_rewrite->rules;
}

add_action('init','cmm_flush_rules');

function cmm_flush_rules(){
        global $wp_rewrite;
        $wp_rewrite->flush_rules();
}

Any input is greatful.

They apply in both instances:

Without an opcode cache, your PHP runtime (mod-php, fpm, whatever) has to
load, compile and execute completely different sets of files. They'll use
RAM in the PHP runtime, waste system disk cache (which will help you a bit,
but not much), etc. Plus, that's going to be a *lot* of work reading and
compiling separate-but-identical WordPress codebases on every request!
(Reminder: Always use an opcode cache.)

With an opcode cache, your PHP runtime won't have to load and compile all
those files on every request, but it will maintain them separately in the
opcode cache implemenation's shared memory (because they are different
files, with different file names, it can't tell), which is a waste. You'd
have to make your opcode cache N times the size it would normally need to
be, just to get the benefit of using it at all.

In short: Try your very hardest not to run multiple WordPress instances...
and hooray for multisite. :-)

Flushing the rewrite rules on init is not recommended.  This recreates the
.htaccess / web.config file on every page load (admin, ajax, and front end).

Try using an option or activation hook to only flush the rewrite rules when
you actually need to.

Is there a way to have two different sites (e.g. site1.example.com and 
site2.example.com) running WordPress multi-site but have a separate, 
non-WordPress app installed on the two sites? One of my sites has a 
Dokuwiki installation  integrated into it, so I couldn't figure out how 
to get WP to work nicely via multi-site. Thanks, this has been an 
interesting discussion. Mike

So usually with multisite in subdomain mode, you'd have a configuration
doing something like this (warning, pseudo-config)...

server *.example.com {
  root /srv/example.com/wordpress
  fastcgi_pass phpfpm
}

... which handles requests for all the subdomains. All you have to do is
get a little more specific, and duplicate some of your config. Just add
something along the lines of:

server site1.example.com {
  root /srv/example.com/wordpress
  fastcgi_pass phpfpm

  alias /wiki /srv/site1.example.com/dokuwiki
}

If you want to ease maintenance, split out the common bits and use an
include. :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom Types, 500 internal error, IIS6
Message-ID: <CAGguigeGwTm9PsAYmjg+oJ1rUcuhabVdvdpBHDJ39b95M-M_Hw@mail.gmail.com>

I built a site located on an IIS6 server.  A month ago a custom type
with two taxonomies were working, with individual views and a couple
of custom pages that collected them in interesting ways functioning
correctly.

Two days ago I got a frantic note from the client.  Creating a new
custom type and selecting "view" results in a 500 internal server
error.  During my explorations I also figured out that the pages that
display lists of the custom type (sorted by two taxonomies I built) no
longer display entries either.  I do not know if these are related
issues - my hunch is they may not be. (This is because a simple
taxonomy view page still shows entries, while the more complicated one
we're actually using doesn't.) In either case, every single custom
type shows a 500 when you try to view it from the admin or type in the
URL.

I do know the code hasn't been touched in three weeks.
I do not know if the server had been changed in any way.  I've asked.
I have checked the PHP error log -- no entries in some time. I checked
php.ini to make sure I had the right location.  Seems ok.
I tried setting the permalinks to something else, then back.  no dice.
I do have flush_rewrite_rules(); in strategic locations in the code
(after the custom type and both taxonomies).
So far as I know IIS doesn't use htaccess files, and I'm not sure how
to do the equivalent.  I've written to ask.
It's possible I changed something shortly before leaving town (I'm
technically on vacation) that didn't cause it to break until IIS
flushed a rule. The client added specs about names that meant I had to
change the slugs for several items in the last week.  They appeared to
be working, but it's the only thing I can think of that would cause
both the 500 error and the disappearing content. If so, I need to
figure out how to flush IIS so I can tell if I fix it back...

I'm not sure how useful links are, but here is a page showing a 500
local error for me:
http://pprc.org/index.php/greening_sports/king-county-stormwater-services/
This topic-taxonomy page (not in use) shows that the entries exist:
http://pprc.org/index.php/topic/sports-energy/
But this metro-area taxonomy page is not bringing up the entries it
should: http://pprc.org/index.php/metro/phoenix/  the template worked
three weeks ago.

Any help would be greatfully accepted.

Thanks,
Shasta

Ya I switched to flush on register_activation_hook.

Which action would be the best to add the add_rewrite_rule to? Is init ok
for that?

Flushing the rewrite rules on init is not recommended.  This recreates the
.htaccess / web.config file on every page load (admin, ajax, and front end).

Try using an option or activation hook to only flush the rewrite rules when
you actually need to.

I second Gordon, you will have to create a manual function to clear it.

For some time now I've wondered exactly how the APC opcode cache works and if it's possible to save RAM by making a number of separate WordPress installs share the same codebase. The alternative being assigning an additional 30MB+ of RAM for each virtual host (WordPress site) you add to Apache.

Over the last couple of days I've managed to do some load testing and other trials to see exactly how the APC opcode cache works and I can confirm that linking to a shared WordPress core using hard or soft links will save you lots of RAM (the more sites that share the codebase the bigger the benefits). This can be confirmed by looking at the system cache page of apc.php that comes with the APC distro.

So if you have 100 separate WordPress sites hosted on a single web server and each site maintains it's own WordPress core codebase you would need (at the very minimum) 30MB RAM per site, to fit all of your compiled PHP files in the cache (3GB total). If you don't have APC configured (in php.ini or apc.ini) with enough RAM for every PHP file processed by the server then you'll lose the performance gain because the cache will need to be completely expunged every time it fills.

It's much better to create a soft link to a single core codebase, so each of those 100 sites shares the same core WordPress files. Even though the core files are shared and only cached once for all of your sites you'll still need a bit of RAM for caching you're theme files and plugins but each site might only need to be allocated 10MB of RAM (1GB for all those sites). So that's a saving of 2GB RAM!

That above is just for the opcode cache, you might need another few GB if you want to use APC as an object cache for all those sites and if you're storing fully cached pages in the APC object cache you'll want even more.

So if you use the APC opcode cache and have multiple websites either use WordPress multisite or find a way to share the same code base with hard or soft links. Opcode caching makes a massive difference on page load speeds and the amount of resources the web server needs to process requests, especially if your PHP files are accessed over something like an NFS share.

	Environment
Message-ID: <CAB7RyRebUKvZtuzf2g-LaMVfKXRZS87z6SwXpjH20WP4UxW-Bg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I normally develop my clients' sites as sub-sites on my own multi-site
installation. However, I recently started a project for a client using the
Limon<http://themeforest.net/item/limon-a-restaurant-and-spa-wordpress-theme/610441>premium
theme from
ThemeForest<http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fthemeforest.net%2F&ei=vaE7UPbpMIXUiwL8kYE4&usg=AFQjCNFnRgHGLALKi4NkGvMkq_53_lH98Q&sig2=m8lmgjZ6ifODvZA1k5imhA>.
After struggling for nearly a week trying to configure it, then working
with its developers for another week trying to figure out what the problem
was, they finally informed me that the Limon theme does not play nicely
with the sub-site of a Multi-site install. Dang. I'm new-ish to the
multi-site, so am not entirely sure how it affects the rest of my hosting
environment. I used the subdomain configuration (as opposed to sub-folders)
and set my host (Bluehost) to accept wildcard domains. So here's my
question, is it ok to just install another single-site in a completely
separate host directory than my multi-site?

Thanks,

Jason Chafin

I can't even begin to imagine what they could have done to that theme to make it not work in multisite.  To answer you question you will need to add another vhost that points to the separate directory.

That indeed is a fascinating article. Though one comment suggested there
could be security issues with the method but does not go into what they
are. From what I can tell the only issue is if one site gets hacked they
all do, which is true of WP Multisite and Wordpress.com hasn't had any
issues with that AFAIK. Plus there is the advantage of only having to
monitor one codebase for hacks.

What are your thoughts, any other security issues with this I should be
concerned about if I go down this route?

Subject: [wp-hackers] the home.php problem: does it asks for a posts.php ?
Message-ID: <CAB6WXM5gF1f4CuWenH-6wsde+VXm-ER=64CuMHahc9unbyTOwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Imagine you create a home.php or front-page.php template in your theme.

Ok, now the visitor sees this template when visiting your sites front page.
You can put anything you want there, in a template totally different from
the blog template. Cool.

Now you want to have a link to the lists of posts of your site, right? Of
course it should be easy. But here you get in a weird situation with no
good solution so far.

Solution 1 - Page template

You create a page template, with a simple code that executes query_posts()
and load your index.php.

This is not a good solution for at least 2 reasons. First, body_class()
does not work well in this situation. Second, it requires the user to
create the page and assign the template, this means he/she can break the
site if this page is edited or deleted

Solution 2 - Use the Reading settings as usual, and create 2 page
templates. In this case, you will probably have to edit the name of your
home.php file because sometimes it conflicts with these options. In other
words, this scenario makes home.php useless.

So, isnt it a good idea to have a posts.php template? Lets think about this
solution:

We have now post type archives, so, in theory, we could have a
archive-post.php and if we access mysite.com?post_type=post we would see
our blog there. It works, but it does not look very good when we're using
beatiful permalinks.

If we follow the same structure we have for others CPTs, visiting
mysite.com/post would take me to the same place. But it does not, because
this rewrite rule doesnt exist.

Adding this rule could be a solution, but not a good one. /post/ is not a
good URI for a blog.

So what I think that could be done:

. add a default rewirte rule that redirects /blog/ (or /posts/) to
?post_type=post (and then we use archive-post.php in our theme).

. add an option in the permalinks page that lets the user change the posts
base URI, as they do with categories and tags.

What do you think about that?

There's just no need to use page templates on the second case. They are
only needed if you combine a home.php file with no Reading Settings.

If you set Reading options for both the home page and posts page, everytime
you navigate to your posts' page the theme will fire index.php instead of
home.php or front-page.php and your list is good to go.

Am I missing something?

You might want to revisit the Template
Hierarchy<http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy>.
It appears that you use "home.php" and "front-page.php" interchangeably,
but they are not interchangeable.

   - The "front-page.php" template file is used to render the SITE FRONT
   PAGE (i.e. home_url()), regardless of whether the front page displays the
   blog posts index, or a static page.
   - The "home.php" template file is used to render the BLOG POSTS INDEX,
   whether the blog posts index is displayed on the site front page, or on a
   static page.

If your goal is to modify the *site front page* content, then you should
*always* use "front-page.php" for this purpose, and NOT "home.php".

So, your Solution 1 isn't necessary:

Solution 1 - Page template
You create a page template, with a simple code that executes query_posts()
and load your index.php.
This is not a good solution for at least 2 reasons. First, body_class()
does not work well in this situation. Second, it requires the user to
create the page and assign the template, this means he/she can break the
site if this page is edited or deleted


Assuming your Theme includes an "index.php", you don't need to make any
other template-file changes. You *can* include a "home.php", but it's not
mandatory.

Side note: you should *never* be using query_posts(), for anything.

Avoiding the conflation of "home.php" and "front-page.php" should explain
why Solution 2 is also not necessary:

Solution 2 - Use the Reading settings as usual, and create 2 page
templates. In this case, you will probably have to edit the name of your
home.php file because sometimes it conflicts with these options. In other
words, this scenario makes home.php useless.


The "home.php" template file is only useless if "front-page.php" exists,
and the site front page is set to display the blog posts index. But that's
as intended. The "front-page.php" template file is intended to be used to
define some *custom* content for the site front page. If you merely want to
customize the blog posts index layout/style, use "home.php".

So, isnt it a good idea to have a posts.php template?


Hopefully you see now what that is unnecessary? What you propose as
"posts.php" is exactly the purpose and intent of "home.php".

Regards,

Chip

I had the same issue and what I did was to add a checkbox to select wether
the user want to use the custom colors or not. Not good...

The core team is working in a new color picker to replace farbtastic, and
it then should be fixed because it has a "clear" button.

I think you're just getting confused with the "home" and "front page" 
terminology a bit.

home.php is your blog posts template (i.e., your 'post' post type 
archive). It's always used when is_home() is true, even if this is not 
the front page of your site.  You should never "put anything you want in 
there" with this template.  It's for showing your blog posts.

front-page.php is to override anything shown on the front page of the 
site, regardless of any other settings.

Maybe that helps explain it a bit.

I actually forgot to ask in my email if I was missing something huge here.
But beleive me, I see a lot of people running into the same problem.

I understand the difference between home.php and front-page.php better now,
but the question that brought me here is: if I have a front-page.php file
in my theme, what link my visitor will have to access to see my latests
posts? Does it have necessarily to be done through the Reading options and
setting up a page template?

Not necessarily.  You could always set up custom rewrite rules. It's 
just easier to do it through the reading settings.

You don't need a page template for it though.  Actually, I don't think 
you can even use a page template at all anyway.  WP will automatically 
use "home.php" or, if it doesn't exist, fall back to "index.php".

Yes, I see the root fo the confusion now.

Sometimes I just think that those optinos in the readin panel are dangerous
for the user. I dont want to have a dummy page called "blog" to list my
blog posts. The user can accidentally delete this page and break the site.
or tweak that option...

As a theme developer, what Im looking for is a way to force what will be
displayed in the front page and where the visitor will find the blog.

If I write a front-page.php file and access the root of my site. I have
whatever I want there, despite of what is selected on the reading settings.
But then I dont have a URL to acccess my blog... see?

I could make a custom rewrite rule, Ive done it sometimes, but I just
though I would bring this up here cause its seems something lots of people
want to do and that should have a better support. But I understand now that
we can not do somethig thar ignores the reading settings...

hmmm...

side note: according to you guys this page shoulbe be banned from the
codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Making_Your_Blog_Appear_in_a_Non-Root_Folder

Is that the case of emphasizing such information on this very same
documentation page? I ask because, as Leo said, I've also seen a lot
of people misusing `home.php` as the site front page, and reading back
the (English) documentation, in fact, looks confusing to me.

In the other hand, the pt_BR translation for this page curiously
switch places of `home.php` and `front-page.php`. Can this be a
contribution for all this confusion?

Thanks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] "enter_title_here" filter and Appearance > Menus
Message-ID: <CAHuhiC1_koBnh6whTdKsrvW34Ftg3a=FTqFzZYAghpmSB+QFbQ@mail.gmail.com>

My plugin utilizes a CPT, and I am using the "enter_title_here" filter to
default the Title field on the CPT's Edit screen.

In my original filter function, I initially forgot to call
get_current_screen() & check that the current edit screen was for my CPT --
so as you might expect, the title default occurred on Posts and Pages, not
just my CPT.  My code:

function mcg_change_default_title( $title ) {

$screen = get_current_screen();

if  ( 'mcg-cpt' == $screen->post_type ) {
$title = 'foo';
 }

return $title;
}

add_filter( 'enter_title_here', 'mcg_change_default_title' );


One additional side effect I discovered is that Menus (under Appearance)
are also targeted unless I add the screen check.  So if I added a new Menu
Item, it would rename.

Questions:

   1. Was this filter's effect on Menus intended?  The only Trac ticket I
   could find was the one that implemented this filter, and it only discussed
   CPTs.
   2. "enter_title_here" is not documented in the Codex.  So I'm not aware
   if there's a alternate filter to more narrowly target the title (something
   like "enter_title_here_mcg-cpt", "enter_title_here-post", etc.).  Is my
   code above the correct approach?

Thanks in advance,

MMc...

I've always used the following:

function cpt_gettext( $text ) {
        global $post_type;

        if ( is_admin() && 'Enter title here' == $text && 'your_cpt' ==
$post_type ) {
            $text = 'Enter CPT name here';
        }

        return $text;
}
add_action( 'gettext', 'cpt_gettext' );

Pulled from the code I use on my site:

add_filter( 'enter_title_here', 'th_enter_title_here', 10, 2 );

function th_enter_title_here( $title, $post ) {

     if ( in_array( $post->post_type, array( 'theme', 'plugin', 'book' ) 
) ) {

         $post_type = get_post_type_object( $post->post_type );
         $title = sprintf( 'Enter %s name here', strtolower( 
$post_type->labels->singular_name ) );
     }

     return $title;

I started out this discussion with the wrong focus.

The focus is: Do you think that having to add and mantain to dummy pages as
placeholders for the Home and the Blog are a good thing? I dont. I think
its very confusing for the user and also very dangerous.

What I wanted to discuss is a way to give the ability to the theme authors
to say how the front page and blogs page will look like, and where it will
be accessible. No dummy pages needed.

There was some discussion of dummy pags here:

Message-ID: <CAGtTZ+ZhHuvqj8i-cJXkTCqoPxEStt+b_GSspBBUpnTeem8miA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm aware this might not be the best place for this but it does involve
"hacking".

I modified the Customize.php settings so the user can update site options
(address, city, phone number, etc...) these are NOT theme options but exist
via a plugin and are created using register_setting().

I also create a custom role for that user and gave them the ability to
"edit_theme_options".

With that ability they are now able to go to customize.php and update site
options.

While this actually works perfect for me this does seem like a bug.

thoughts?

As a theme developer, what Im looking for is a way to force what will be
displayed in the front page and where the visitor will find the blog.


It's not the purpose of the *Theme* to dictate what is displayed on the
front page. That is a decision for the end user, and the end user alone.

Are there ways to improve the UX with respect to that front-page selection?
Sure. And such improvements are already under discussion (cf. the Trac
ticket John linked). But I am an adamant proponent of Themes remaining
within their functional scope: that is to *present* content, not to
*define* or *manage* content or site options (including whether the front
page should display the blog posts index or static content).

side note: according to you guys this page shoulbe be banned from the
codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Making_Your_Blog_Appear_in_a_Non-Root_Folder


The current version of that Codex entry is just shy of three years old.
That's bound to happen in a community/volunteer-maintained Codex. *Banned*
from the Codex? No; it merely needs to be updated to reflect current best
practices, such as the use of the pre_get_posts filter instead of
query_posts(), and (more importantly) to reflect current WordPress UX. In
all honesty, that Codex entry likely not even *needed* anymore, as
assigning the blog posts index to a static Page named "blog" is all that is
required to accomplish the purpose of that entry.

Regards,

Chip

I use to auto-create a page called Home and offer a template page for it. 
Still the option is up to user whether to set this page as the home or not. 
There is some way to do all this auto, but I lack code expertise for say so 
:)

Hi Chip,

Thanks for your responses:

... But I am an adamant proponent of Themes remaining

> page should display the blog posts index or static content).


This makes perfect sense when you are creating a general porpouse blog
theme. But when you are creating a theme specifically designed for one
site, that is not true. There is no situation where the site owner will
want to change what appears on the home page. And thats why Im bringing
this up. This option, in that case (most of the cases for people who build
websites using WP, I beleive) this option is not just useless and confusing
but also dangerous, because the user can accidentally removing his homepage
(by tweaking this option or deleting one of the dummy pages).

Do you see my point?

Its not good at all to have to explain to a client "see this page? it has
no content and anything you write here wont appear anywhere, but please
dont delete cause it will break your site".

It really makes sense to me that themes should be able to disable those
Reading options and define through the template files.

Hi, everyone,

I'm C?tia, from Brazil, I'm new here, but this discussion interests me,
because I agree with Leo.

As a theme developer, what Im looking for is a way to force what will be

You're assuming that this end user is the kind who's got a personal blog or
small business site that he himself maintain, who might want to change the
theme whenever he wants from the admin. But if you suppose this end user is
a bigger client who paid us to develop his site, from the information
architecture to the deploy, he is indeed paying someone to dictate what is
displayed on the front page, this decision is done beforehand, so he
wouldn't want to let this option open to anyone with access to the admin to
change it. Do you understand what I mean?
That's our worries!

In a bespoke development, the developer is an agent of the user, who is the
client. There's no reason that the developer, who develops the Theme,
installs the Theme, and configures the Theme can't also make the necessary
reading settings changes to ensure the site properly displays a static
front page.

Nevertheless, the use case you describe is not one that is shared by the
vast majority of WordPress users, and the ability of the Theme to dictate
what appears as the site front page would be detrimental to that vast
majority.

I agree with Chip. If you don't want your client changing site options like
what page shows up on the front page, don't make them an admin of the site.

But I also agree with a few commenters that it can be confusing to see a
blank page in the admin. A useful addition might be to add a little notice
to the top of the Edit Page screen if the current page is set as the Posts
page.

The Page Links To plugin by Mark Jaquith does something similar when you
redirect a page to another URL: http://twitpic.com/aopuwe

I'm sure there's a plugin that already does this (and if not, it should
only take a few minutes to create).

I believe the Trac ticket linked up-thread addresses some of these UX
issues...

I think you guys need to take a look at the template hierarchy again. 
There's even a picture

First off, front-page.php and home.php are different.

FRONT-PAGE.PHP
===========
Basically, it works like this. If you put front-page.php file in your 
theme, it will fire every time you visit the home page.

EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Even if you set Settings->Reading to "Latest Posts" or Static Page, this 
template will be used if it is present. The only difference is what's 
available in the queried object. Look at the picture - the *first* black 
box encountered tells you which template will be loaded (if the template 
file is present that is)


HOME.PHP
==========
If you put home.php template file in your theme, then this template will 
fire only if you are looking at the Blog Posts Index page but only if 
front-page.php hasn't been fired. Now there are only 2 situations where 
the home.php template file will load and this is when:

1. Settings -> Reading is set to Latest Posts and (this is important) 
*there is no front-page.php file present*. If front-page.php is present, 
then that is the template that will be used, not home.php.
2. Settings -> Reading is set to static page and the page that you are 
looking at right now is the page that is specified as the Posts page


So, if you want to FORCE what will be displayed on the front page, then 
create a front-page.php file. If you're the kind who wants to give the 
end user a choice, then you can either create a home.php file or use a 
page template depending on how you've set up your theme - but do not 
create a front-page.php file.


As for giving end users the option of what to display on the home page, 
I think it boils down to "how much control can I give the user without 
them breaking the site?" Sure, you can give the user options but also be 
prepared to code your theme in such a way so that any option the user 
chooses will still look good.

The point is, the developer has the tools needed to either make a theme 
that *dictates* what should be shown on the frontpage or make it 
possible to give the end user a choice. All in all, it's up to the 
developer to give or take away that choice. Assuming of course the 
developer actually understands the system they are using and know what 
they're doing..

I wouldn't say the vast majority, I'd stick with just majority. If you've

amount of people outhere using WordPress to build sites for large
businesses, government, non profits, etc.

that are made exclusively to a client. It's not detrimental to anybody if
it's what the client asked and paid for.

That data isn't an accurate representation of what Chip was referring to 
when he said "vast majority".

* The vast majority of users control their own WordPress setup.
* The minority of users have developers set up their site.

Thanks for the alternate ways of coding using the "enter_title_here"
filter, guys.  My question remains outstanding -- if there's a way to
better target by the filter name itself, vs. having to account for it
within the function.

Hi, Ryan
I'll take that as a joke. ;) If you read all the messages you certainly
know that, though Leo made a confusion between home.php and front-page.php,
he knows the template hierarchy as he's an experienced WordPress
developper, and so am I. Otherwise, I'd say you're quite conceited, weren't
you? :P

But you're missing our point here, we know how to FORCE what will be
displayed on the front-page, that's not the question. The point is in the
end, depending on the case, we need dummy pages and we think that's bad.

I agree with Chip. If you don't want your client changing site options like
> what page shows up on the front page, don't make them an admin of the site.
>

It's not reasonable not to make the owner of a site its admin. At least
where I work we believe we owe the client the right to control his own
site, since it's his. :) But at the same time we think the site shouldn't
be so vulnerable to mistakes. If someday he won't be our client any longer,
he needs the admin anyway. And we can't rely on the fact that nobody will
ever delete the home! You know, bad things happen! If one of my clients who
sells advertisements on his front-page has it deleted, oops, it's easy to
loose a lot of money!

And this kind of users aren't bigger businesses, governments, non profits,
etc., who can afford developers?

I'm truly failing to see how any of what you just wrote has to do with 
what I wrote.  Copy/paste error in your reply?

If not, I'm guessing you just misunderstood Chip's point about how 
*themes* should not dictate the structure of a site for the vast 
majority of users.  It's about who controls the site, not what type of 
site they run.

IMO, functionalities that made possible the use and adaptation of
themes by agencies are responsible for a reasonable amount of
WordPress' popularity. I wouldn't <only> count users that had setup
their installations to define the viability of introducing a new
feature, specially if it will not affect all users.

Sorry if I came across as conceited. that wasn't my intention ;) of 
course I understand if you feel that way if you're sort of being 
"lectured to" with you guys already experienced and all (and I'm not 
being sarcastic here promise).. so yeah, that was how I saw it, someone 
who seemed to mix front-page.php and home.php and didn't seem to fully 
understand what it did..

but totally my fault, and I'm sorry for my confusion.

> But at the same time we think the site shouldn't
> be so vulnerable to mistakes.

So, now that's cleared up (I hope) what would be the ideal way to assign 
content to the homepage? Would it be possible to make it so that 
deleting an important page (such as a page assigned as the front page or 
blog) triggers a warning popup or something? would that at least 
decrease the chances of important pages being deleted?

And yes, I just had a client do this to me 3 months a go.. it's not nice.

So, now that's cleared up (I hope) what would be the ideal way to assign
content to the homepage? Would it be possible to make it so that deleting
an important page (such as a page assigned as the front page or blog)
triggers a warning popup or something? would that at least decrease the
chances of important pages being deleted?


I would recommend getting involved with the Trac ticket linked up-thread. :)

I've had good luck with this snippet, dropped in mu-plugins or 
functions.php, for preventing these "oops" moments.

    add_action( 'wp_trash_post', 'prevent_oops' );
    add_action( 'before_delete_post', 'prevent_oops' );

    function prevent_oops( $postid ) {

         if( $postid == get_option( 'page_on_front' ) || $postid ==
    get_option( 'page_for_posts' ) ) {
             wp_die( 'You are trying to delete a very important page.' );
             exit;
         }

    }

Not as slick as it could be, but gets the job done, and could be 
augmented to check for a post meta flag that would allow other pages to 
be 'protected' from deletion.
> And yes, I just had a client do this to me 3 months a go.. it's not nice.
Been there done that, not nice at all.

Hope that helps.

The type of users who have developers set up their sites are the type of

users are bigger businesses, governments or non profits, though not
necessarily.

 (removing filter by post date)
Message-ID: <CAEgmxaaPaErY_OVnMiF7tdR7Kc0ZU8gzXUSFn5K-0uU5JKDW-w@mail.gmail.com>

I have a custom post type where the 'filter by post date' does not make
sense. Posts by default use WP_List_Table which calls extra_tablenav() from
display_tablenav() without any filters (that I can see) to stop this
behaviour.

Would it be possible to extend the class to rework display_tablenav() and
the make WP use that list table instead? If so, where do I start this?

Ideally I'd be able to add some headers in there as well as remove the date
filter.

Sorry if I came off as rude asking you a legitimate question and telling 
you that I didn't understand you.  I realize that not everyone here is a 
native English speaker, so some text can be easily misinterpreted.  It 
was not my intention to be unfriendly.

I see now what you meant, so thank you for explaining that.  It just 
doesn't further the discussion in any way to me.  I was simply trying to 
explain to you what Chip meant by "vast majority".

Hi Tom,

I just looked through the code and unfortunately there's no way to affect what you are trying to do via subclassing of WP_List_Table.  It seems the _get_list_table() function would need a hook that would let you change both the list table class and the PHP file to load.  Time for a trac ticket?

You might be able to achieve what you are after with CSS and Javascript, albeit that's a hack.

I believe that, for whatever reason, this is by design. When the list
table classes were introduced the plan was to see how well they worked
and how they were used before allowing plugins/themes to extend them
(correct me if I'm wrong anyone).

> You might be able to achieve what you are after with CSS and Javascript, albeit that's a hack.

I've previously done this by enqueuing CSS (which hides the dropdown)
based on the post type in the current_screen object.

You can add filters to this dropdown via the 'restrict_manage_posts'
action and then filtering posts on the 'request' hook.

So "by design" as you say isn't it now time to explore how to extend them?

That said and contrary to my own suggestion to add a trac ticket above I am not a fan of enabling public extension via subclassing because of subclassing's adherence to Highlander motto[1].

Tom,

One way of doing it is to "hide" that filter (with CSS) or remove it 
with JS. Indeed, you can easily add an extra class to the body with 
'admin_body_class' filter (depending on the $pagenow and $post_type 
global vars for example) to only target your CPT list.

To add one or more filters after those included by WordPress, you can 
use the 'restrict_manage_posts' action.

Unfortunately, I think that John is right on that, you cannot extend the 
list table classes for now.

Hope that helps.
Lionel

The vas majority of the users may want us not to touch that options. But by
"user" we are assuming someone who manages his site, tweak options and
change themes. Ok.

But the vas majority of developers who use WordPress to build regular sites
for their clients will want to set up a custom front page and, in that
case, will have to set up 2 dummy pages as placeholders.

The point I was bringing up is to give the tools for this developer to do
this without the dummy pages and the problems we've discussed here.
(alerting upon editing/deletion is a weak workaround in my opinion...).

Themes already interfere on how things will be displayed (does it support
custom headers? does it support nav_menus, sidebars, etc). I beleive this
could be an option for the developer, perhaps using add_theme_support()...

Vinicius and I wroked in a plugin that does what we are proposing:
https://github.com/vmassuchetto/wordpress-force-front-page/ (we didnt find
a good name yet....)

If there is a front-page.php file it will get rid of the "Front Page
Displays" option from the Reading Settings and add an option in the
permalink page to setup your blog address. It does not touch the template
hierarchy, you still may use home.php or index.php for your blog, while
front-page.php will be used to display the root of your website.

We also started working in a way to add these 2 links (home and blog) to
the Nav Menus page in the admin, so you can add them to your menus. Its in
a branch.

Im gonna join the discussion at the trac, cause I saw there people who have
the same needs and maybe want to join the discussion, since this is not
exactly the point there.

Leo,,

ps - I assume the guilt of making this discussion so long and out of focus
because of my lame first email. sorry all.

(More a php question I think)

I created a filter that places content on posts and pages but since I'm combining some tags such <li> etc I endeup with silly empty tags if any value is provided  :(

One or two ok check with (!empty)  but I have ten values, what is the best pratice?!

Thanks!

The current criteria is as follows:

Is the function already pluggable (i.e. wrapped in a function_exists()
check)?

YES: Keep it in pluggable.php
NO: Don't make it pluggable; add a filter at the end instead.

Hi Diana

Do you mind pasting the code for your function here?

Thanks for the replies everyone!

I have for now applied a body_class and hidden the filter with jQuery.
Posted my 'solution' on forums, will supply at the end of this email too.

I don't personally know whether the core solution should be the ability to
extend the class, or via filters. "Hooks and filters" is my usual mantra to
others, but I'm sure the core devs are much better suited to answer that.

I would like to contribute, and it probably is the oldest and lamest excuse
ever, but I don't have the time to contribute (what I would feel to be)
constructively. So as much I would love to submit a trac ticket (
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/) perhaps I'd be better off leaving it in
the ideas section (http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/).

Tom


PHP
add_filter( 'admin_body_class', 'tcb_admin_body_class' );
function tcb_admin_body_class( $classes ){
  $screen = get_current_screen();

  if( is_array($classes) ) :
    $classes[] = $screen->post_type;
  else :
    $classes .= ' ' . $screen->post_type;
  endif;

  return $classes;
}

JavaScript
jQuery('body.post-type .tablenav.top .actions:nth-child(1)').hide();

I won't claim this is 'best practice', but... I use a handy little 
function to check if a post meta value is set before echoing.

    // In my functions.php file

    function echo_if_meta( $arr, $key, $before = '', $after = '' ) {

         if( $text = $arr[$key][0] )
             echo $before . $text . $after;

    }

    // In my template

    <?php $meta = get_post_custom(); ?>
    <ul>
         <?php echo_if_meta( $meta, '_my_key', '<li>My Key: ', '</li>'); ?>
         <?php echo_if_meta( $meta, '_my_key_2', '<li>My Key 2: ',
    '</li>'); ?>
    </ul>

You could adapt this for a returned value in a filter.

In short, write yourself a little function to check if the value is set 
and return null if not, and return the value wrapped in start and end 
tags if set.

Hope that helps,

Jackson

Self-explaining title, I think.

I'm planning on doing some heavy query-altering as soon as possible on page
load, so I'm gathering my options, here.

Also, are there any other actions like `post_where` to get other parts of
the actual query being run against the database?

Any heads-up will help.

thanks!

Hi Ricardo,

pre_get_posts runs first. But actually they are very different hooks.

With pre_get_posts you will manipulate the wp_query object, changing its
properties before the SQL statement is written.

posts_where is to filter the WHERE statement after all the properties of
the wp_query object were interpreted and the SQL statement is ready to run.

So the first one is easier to use and you have less chances of breaking
everything. The second one you will manipulate a string, maybe with some
regexp, its trickier...

I think you should allways try pre_get_posts first and, unless theres no
way to achieve what you like (rare cases), use posts_where and all the
other filters (posts_join, etc...)

cheers

Leo,,

Hey,

I'm aware of the differences, but i've just yesterday run into one of those
cases where they need to be combined. I was altering the main search query
to get a meta_value and also filtering a search string to NOT search for
post_title or post_content. This ->
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/q/63577/7890.

Use case here is this:

I have a multisite installation with 5 sites: 3 of them have the same
structure, parent-theme, post_types, etc, child themes manage css and
access-permissions only. One is for registration/login/redirect only, and
the last one is a kind of aggregator, where we list contents from those 3
in a different manner, intended for admins only.

I need to alter the queries on that last site so that it would combine the
3 other's contents seamlessly, as if they were this site's content, and not
external. I'm reluctant as to make this another child-theme of the master
one that serves the other three because their structure is very different,
but I'm also reluctant on relying on using switch_to_blog() on the
templates to make separate queries and then join them later.

My best shot at this right now is to run a combination of
get_blogs_of_user() and switch_to_blog() inside pre_get_posts and
posts_where, somehow forcing them to get and serve all that content as one
native query-object, against which I'd be able to use paginate_links() and
other functions heavily dependent on the $wp_query global.

Is that any clear? Any thoughts? Am I reinventing the wheel?

I.e. The whole concept of pluggable functions is legacy. If
reverse-compatibility wasn't an issue they'd all be removed.

I just added a sentence to the "Pluggable
Functions<http://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions>"
Codex article for the next person wondering about the seemingly random
choice of functions that are pluggable:

"Pluggable functions are no longer being added to WordPress core. All new
functions instead use filters on their output to allow for similar
overriding of their functionality."

What I like to do in this cases is to republish the posts in this "index"
site. After that add a filter to "post_link" so it will allways link to the
original post.

Doing that is easy to have a list of posts from all sites and to search for
them. They will be presented in a list but if the visitor clicks, the
points to that post in the original site. You could even check in the
single.php if the post came from another blog and redirect the visitor if
he, somehow, finds the url for that post in the index blog...

You can do all this hooking int save_post and delete_post.

I have a working code I can share with you if you like.

What are the reasons for this? Just curious if there are technical reasons
or what.

One of the technical problems is that core cannot decide one day that
current pluggable functions are no longer pluggable. Many plugins
would stop working as expected because the pluggable functions they
include will no longer override those in core. Particularly poorly
written plugins may even cause fatal errors if they're blindly
overriding pluggable functions without wrapping them in a
function_exists() check.

One ticket addressing pluggable functions is here:
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8833

There are lots of reasons to stay away from pluggable function. The most 
glaring is the fact that plugin authors can easily cause the site to 
blow up with fatal errors. The way pluggable works is that the core 
checks to see if that function already exists. If it does in your plugin 
then the core version does not load. Sounds cool but what about

- Your plugin overrrides wp_mail, plugin X also overrides wp_mail. You 
install both, your site dies
- Your plugin overrides wp_mail but you are polite enough to ensure that 
nothing else has overridden wp_mail. Now plugin X owns wp_mail and your 
plugin's functionality now no longer works, potentially blowing up the 
site still

See? Don't make pluggable functions. Use hooks. Hooks can be tapped into 
unlimited times to alter whatever needs altering by your plugin

Working on a custom theme... We're using <!--more--> in the posts.

Long story short, I'd like to modify the class that's applied to the href:

<p>
<a class="more-link"
href="http://50.112.124.120/blog/2012/08/20/looks-like-more-wednesdays-in-pac-12-schedule/#more-27">Continue
reading</a>
</p>

On the template:

<?php the_content(); ?>

I've setup a function to override the excerpt:

...
add_filter('excerpt_more', 'crazy_excerpt_more');
...

That does not seem to work... All I get is "(more...)" output on my page.

I assume the "excerpt_more" does not apply to <!--more--> via
the_content() function?

I've read through the docs, but I'm having troubles piecing things
together. Any tips and/or pointers would be great!

Thanks!

Hi Chris, thanks for the reply, I really appreciate it.

Yah, that's not working. Sorry that I did not post my full code;
here's what I've got:

Template:

<?php the_content(); ?>

... and here's from functions.php:

function crazy_excerpt_more($more) {
	global $post;
	return '<p class="custom_more-link"><a href="'.
get_permalink($post->ID) . '">More!!!!!!!!!</a></p>';
}
add_filter('excerpt_more', 'crazy_excerpt_more');

I assume there's some sort of catch to using <!--more--> in the post
that "excerpt_more" does not override?

Sorry if noob question. :(

I'm probably overlooking something obvious here.

Thanks again!

Cheers,
M

To give ya'll the full story, I'm trying to determine if it's worth my
time to try and override ALL of the built-in WP dynamically generated
CSS ids/classes; I really want to add a pseudo namespace to the
class/id names that WP generates.

I'm kinda wondering if it will be more trouble that it's worth to do
this... It's looking like I'll have to override one function at a time
in order to change CSS class/id names. Maybe it's just not worth my
time?

I assume there's not one global place/method that I can override to
tweak dynamically generated CSS names?

Thanks for listening.

Mickey,

The filter for the '(more...)' link created by the use of the <!--more-->
tag is 'the_content_more_link'.  Internally, the part of a post before the
<!--more--> tag is called the teaser (and this leads to a flag in the code
called $stripteaser which always amuses me), it has nothing to do with
excerpts.

The filters for the excerpt are a different set: 'excerpt_more' - used on
auto generated excerpts, and 'get_the_excerpt' used on manually created
excerpts.

As to overriding all the built-in classes and id's, I've got to ask why? To
what purpose? I would have thought the fact that all the container blocks
on a WordPress generated page are supplied by the theme, and thus can be
set up however you like. Anything inside those block is then effectively
namespaced.

For example: in Twenty Eleven you have paragraphs than can be selected as

.entry-content p where they occur in the entry blocks, and
.widget p where they occur in widget areas, and
.comment-entry p where they occur in comments,

and so on.

Is that not enough pseudo name spacing for you?


Mike

Ah, I see now. Thank you for the clarification. I knew it had to be
something simple.

Hehe, that is amusing now that you point it out.

Great! Now you've got me headed in the right direction. Much appreciated.

> Is that not enough pseudo name spacing for you?

You're right. That is definitely good enough. I'll leave things be. :)

Thank you again for your advice/tips/feedback! It's been very helpful.

Have a nice day.
