OK. After playing with WP 2.0 for a day, it felt like a significant 
downgrade from 1.5. There's some cool stuff, but a lot of basic 
functionality like decent sized editing boxes has been hidden behind 
flashy features. So I went looking for 1.5 again.

Umm, where is it? There seem to be no downloads on the WP site except 
2.0. Surely the old versions haven't just vanished from the Web yet, 
have they? I'm sure there's an archive directory somewhere, but perhaps 
some nice person could point me at it, and perhaps someone might want to 
make it a little more clearly linked from the Downloads page?

Considering Robert's downgrade script, previous versions ought to be 
made quick
to discover. Having said that, what about exploits in older versions? A "drink
you own poision" policy? Perhaps the 'risk factor' can be indicated e.g. by
putting them apart in a subdirectory?

PS - There is a nightlies collector lurking about. Additionally, sites like
oldversion.com/Web Archive might always make older versions available. There's
no escape.

Do you know something the rest of do not ?
I have asked several times if 1.5.2 is secure, and each time I have been 
assured that it is. If is not, say so clearly.
Please do not make things up in an effort to force people to move to 2.0

The sensible policy is that one continues to make security and bug fixes 
in the stable branch, even if one does not add new features to that. 
Apache is still supporting 1.3, for instance; and many large sites like 
IBiblio prefer it. If that's not planned for WordPress by the current 
maintainers, then perhaps it might be time for those who, like myself, 
prefer 1.5, to consider a 1.5 fork version.

We'll make security fixes if they come up, of course. We still have a
1.5 branch in our SVN repository,
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/branches/1.5.

Of course, that's not the real issue. No-one should prefer 1.5 to 2.0.
If you have issues, list them and we'll fix them. I guess if we can't
persuade you that 2.0 is better, that's cool, but the whole point of
continuing development is to make something better. Theoretically, 2.0
is a few months worth of improvements to 1.5.2. (Naturally, it's not
your fault if you prefer 1.5.2, that's not what I'm implying, I'm
saying it's probably our fault)

Some info I was looking at:

 From release to final version:

1.2 May 22, 2004
1.2.2 December 15, 2004
(7 months including 1.2.1)

1.5 February 17, 2005
1.5.2 August 14, 2005
(6 months including 1.5.1.1, 1.5.1.2, 1.5.1.3)

2.0 December 31, 2005
??

Now I'm not picking on versions, or poking at 2.0 but looking at that I 
can't see why a release cycle cannot be got into now. The WP community 
is now huge and it's used so very widely that maybe predictability will 
be a good thing. The upgrades in the life of 1.5 were not well received 
and I can't see the wider 2.0 audience being any more understanding 
should bugfix releases be needed.

As I see it a release cycle removes all the 'when will it be released', 
allows for a clear roadmap, allows for a proper code-freeze, means 
developers of external tools (such as Ecto) also have more of an idea, 
means everyone knows where they are with respect to wishlist inclusions, 
means that the devs have not just a goal time but also they know that 
immediately after they can wander away from the keyboard for a few 
minutes, and it means that when you release a candidate people know to 
really hit it because of the release date. It also means that support 
know where they are too. Would it help the likes of Fantastico and the 
soon-to-be Yahoo upgrading ? No idea but it can't harm.

I don't think it should necessarily be held to a definite day, but 
certainly within a short time-frame would seem to make more sense that 
the system of "When it's ready" - and I'm not commenting on that because 
that is a diferent issue.

So I can't see anything but good to come from a release cycle. Or maybe 
I'm missing something ?

I was referring to older versions of WordPress, which exist in this direc-
tory.  With lower specifications,  lighter versions are sometimes  sought.
Think  of the "because newer is not always better" slogan. Sometimes  it's
hardware suitability or dependencies issues instead.

If  someone  decided to download version 1.2, for instance, I  thought  it
would be sensible to give some sort of caution or disclaimer. That's all I
meant to say, but you misinterpreted it.

Best wishes,

Roy

There's one big issue that make me want to stay with 1.5: it's not 
nearly as easy or as comfortable to write a new post in 2.0 as in 1.5.

I'm not sure how serious or how deep that problem is. Some of it might 
even be customizations I made in 1.5 that I haven't yet made in 2.0. 
however, there are three specific issues:

1. The input textarea for new posts is about half the size it is in 2.0. 
Writing is what WP is all about. Give me enough space to work in.

2. The font used on this page for input is too small. It needs to be at 
least two points  larger by default.

3. The category list is hidden behind a button rather than being up 
front as it is in 1.5.2. That means what used to be a one step process 
to change the category is now a two-step process. Ditto for the Post 
status, post slug, etc.

Short version: I want the old write post page back. The new page looks 
snazzier but make sit harder to write. What I like about WordPress is 
how easy it makes it to write articles. Anything that improves the 
experience is good. Anything that detracts from it is bad.

The text area is resizeable. In fact, it will "stick" to the length you 
determine once you do it (via a ccookie). Also, you can still set the 
height on the text area in the options.

I can't address this one :/

This is minorly contradicting with you next statement about the focus of 
wordpress. If WP is to focus on writing, most of these things are 
extremely supplimentary. Most the time anyone who's just going to blog 
needs only two things:

1) Title
2) Content

Xanga, Livejournal, MySpace, etc are all build around that central 
"title, type, and post" theme and are successful in getting people to 
use that.

With WP you *have* all those extras, but we hide them because they are 
secondary to writing. Also, I believe that the rolled-out/in status of 
the category, excerpt, etc boxes "sticks" via cookies. (If I am wrong 
about this, I would consider it a bug.)


> Short version: I want the old write post page back. 

I believe someone wrote a plugin which returns the entire 2.0 admin 
interface back to the 1.5.2 look and feel. This may be right up your ally.

IMO. anything that requires a cookie is a bug. If this is a preference, 
it should be saved on the server, not the client. As well as the reasons 
already addressed, and the fact that cookies are completely contrary to 
the web architecture, there's an additional practical problem here for 
those of us who use WordPress from multiple machines, including public 
one.  Any state stored on the client will be lost as I move between 
machines, which I do regularly.

OK. I just noticed that. I still think it should be bigger by default, 
but that helps.

All I can say is I need to do more. In particular, I choose a category 
for almost every post. I almost never leave it as "Uncategorized". Now 
that's a two-step process.

I also think the other options are well supported in 1.5.2. They're down 
below the main edit box where you can play with them if you like and 
easily ignore them if you don't. Now they're hidden. 1.5.2 has a nice 
design where the options are available but don't get in your way. now 
that they're not so available. It's minor, but it is a step backwards.

I'm curious. Has any actual user testing been done on WordPress? In 
other words, has anyone put non-developer users in front of a WordPress 
system, asked them to perform tasks, and watched them to see how they 
do, and what confuses them? I suspect the results would be informative. 
There are some other problems I've noticed in the UI, but so far those 
are all common to 1.5 and 2.0.

True, but an old saw about "pleasing everyone" come to mind. You can
have your old page back but WP is not going to revert for you. The
admin menu is quite pluggable and there is nothing to prevent a plugin
from providing a replacement for any admin page. A sufficiently
brilliant plugin might be rolled into the core as a User option
checkbox.

Upgrade your core and add plugins to taste, or hang back. Is David
Chait on this list? He's an example of somebody who operated his own
fork of 1.2 until 1.5.2 was out, then undertook the arduous process of
up/sidegrading to the WP core, which by then was very stable.

It only needs to be a two-step process the first time. You expand the Categories menu, select the category, write the post. The next time, as long as you don't minimize the categories menu, it is still expanded and categories are immediately accessible. What's the problem?

If anything, 2.0 keeps things out of the way and still easily accessible better than 1.5.x.

Anybody can sign up for beta testing, downloading SVN updates, downloading nightlies. I've been using 1.6a since June. We probably do need to make it easier for people but we don't want people downloading nightlies and thinking they're going to get official support.  They are, after all, for testing and development.

I don't agree with all of the comments there; but I do agree with some
of them: WordPress 2.0 doesn't offer anything substantially better for
the average user.  A lot of plugins break, and though that's not
(necessarily) the fault of WordPress, it's a major blocker for adoption.

*I* appreciate some of the improvements, because they make the things
that *I* do as a plugin developer smoother.  I'm not a hard-core
blogger; I don't play the SEO game; and I'm not trying to monetize my
blog.  As such, WordPress 2.0 is acceptable to me, but I'm not at all
"wowed" by what I was given in the 2.0 release.

A lot of poeple blog for money; or have more complicated usage patterns
than me.  These people don't get much benefit from the upgrade.
Contrast the list of 2.0 release features with the stuff in 1.5's release:
   http://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/
   http://wordpress.org/development/2005/02/strayhorn/

The features given to users in 1.5 were things _a lot_ of people wanted:
comment moderation, whitelisting, pages.
The features given to users in 2.0 are gloss: WYSIWYG editing, resizable
editing, post preview, header customizations.

Of the things that are substantially beneficial to users:
* import should be a one-time thing; so I'm sure it's appreciated but
it's not something people will use again and again -- especially people
upgrading from 1.5
* inline uploading is a great addition, but unfortunately it doesn't
allow the user to control the upload destination.  Hopefully this can be
revised for 2.1

Hopefully 2.1 can include things that make people _excited_ to upgrade.

Vertical resizing of the post screen is pointless. Textareas have
their own native Vertical scrolling that makes perfect sense in the
write screen context, and I should not have to scoll both the page and
the textarea to get the right amount of writing space I desire.
However, vertically, the Write box has shrunken considerably, and I
think is much more of an issue than vertical resizing will fix

And saving via cookies, like has already been mentioned, is a kludgy
hack and does not persist across machines, which is utterly annoying,
and is one of my big annoyances with the whole Write screen.

As long as you use that computer.  Switch to a different PC, and you're

Don't pontificate on what's not a problem for you.  If it's a problem
for someone else, then we should not minimize the complaint just because
we don't agree with it.

Sure, anyone can; and anyone can make suggestions and even offer some
mock-ups for improvement.  A lot of discussion can result, with some
energy building; and then nothing really happens.
   http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001519.html

WordPress isn't designed by committee, and a lot of things that people
actively dislike continue to be rolled in (nofollow, feed: (thankfully
removed), etc).  I don't think formalized (or even informal) user
testing would do any real good unless there was a mechanism to ensure
that the fruits of the testing would translate into product changes.

wordpress.com always tracks the latest development, and we have many
thousands of users on wp.com who love to give feedback.  They worked
with all the iterations of the RTE and the inline uploader, and their
suggestions shaped development.  The RTE is a major draw to wp.com.

I certainly am not minimizing the complaint.  You make a valid point and something that can certainly be fixed by a plugin.  And I'm certainly not saying that it SHOULD be hidden behind AJAX menus but in 2.0, it is.  Perhaps in the future it will not.  So then the question is how to fix it for this release? And that's where plugins come in to play, no?

So are you agreeing with me or disagreeing?  I'm echoing what Ryan said 3 days ago (http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2005-December/001659.html)... We need to do a better job of bringing in testers.  I'm also echoing the sentiments of people like Podz and Moshu who inevitably will have to support pre-release versions if people are just going and haphazardly downloading pre-release version simply because they are the newest and not understanding that they are not stable.  I agree we need more testing but I think it would have to be done in somewhat of a controlled way... Do you agree or disagree?

I tried INSERT IGNORE and UPDATE IGNORE to get around this.  If you were
seeing bug #1837, please try out a nightly or svn and let me know if it
helps.

In other words, no.

This is a real problem for open source software. Nobody does any formal 
or informal user testing; but this is critical for producing usable 
software, especially when you're designing something new and innovative 
like WordPress and not something that's just a copy of an existing 
closed source program that did do user testing.

Effective user testing requires going out and finding users. The users 
who come to you are not representative. Then you have to sit them down 
and watch them operate the system, not rely on what they choose to 
report. Only by doing this can you find out where the real pain points are.

For example, grab your father or your sister (assuming they're not 
techies) and assign them tasks such as:

1. Install WordPress
2. Write  a Post
3. Delete an existing post
4. Write a post in a new category.
5. Comment on an existing post

Then silently watch over their shoulder as they attempt to complete each 
task. Resist the urge to "help" or "explain" to them how they should 
proceed.

You will be astonished at what proves hard to do and what doesn't. You 
may want to ask them to verbalize their thought process in which case 
the mental models they use will be nothing like you expect. But resist 
the urge to correct them. You want to know how users think about 
software so you can design software that flows with them rather than 
fights against them.

Programmers are extremely poor judges of usability. No one can 
reasonably judge the usability of their own program without seeing 
actual users attempt to use it.

In many cases they will not be able to complete the task. They will not 
know how to file a bug. They will not even be able to articulate what 
went wrong. They may very well blame themselves and feel stupid, though 
the bad design that prevents them from completing the task is in now way 
their fault. (It's sometimes a good idea to offer testees chocolate 
after they've finished a test so they don't feel too bad. Be sure to 
emphasize after they've finished the test that any problems they had are 
not their fault; that you know the system is buggy and that's why you're 
testing it. You don't want them to leave feeling bad.)

But you're never going to get this sort of valuable feedback from people 
who figure out how to download and install a beta and then login to the 
bug tacker and write up a bug or user interface glitch. It took me a 
good half hour to figure out where and how to report the first bug I 
found in WordPress. If it takes an ubergeek half an hour to do this, how 
do you expect a non-programmer end user to accomplish this? That's not 
going to happen.

If you want to make usable software, you need to recruit users to test 
the software and then you have to watch them. Do not rely on 
self-reporting.

What you say sounds good and worthwhile, though costly compared to the
free and abundant feedback from WordPress.com users. Any referrals?

You can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars doing this, as you can 
hiring programmers to write code; but can also do it on the cheap. 
You'll get a lot of benefit just by roping in a few non-techie 
friends/family members. watching even one user struggle with your 
software can radically change how you think about it, and approach its 
design.

The next time your mother/brother/significant other/next door 
neighbor/dentist/etc. asks you to come over to fix their network/degunk 
their system/disinfect Windows etc. say sure, but they have to agree to 
be your guinea pig on some user testing for the same amount of time.

I might be wrong, but I thought we were talking about finding bugs,
not usability fixes. For the former you need people used to the system
as well. Otherwise how are bugs in modules like XMLRPC going to be
found?

Testing is the fundamental reason why I think there is so much churning 
on these topics, and it's not just the kind of bug/patch testing that 
we're accustomed to hearing about on these lists.

I've heard more than once that this is the best-tested version of 
WordPress yet.  Maybe more people have downloaded and tried pre-release 
versions of WordPress than before, and maybe there has been a lot of 
feedback from WP.com (none of which seems to be made public like it is 
in Trac, now that I think about it).  Does that imply that user testing 
was done?  Have we really asked uninvolved users what they think of the 
software?  Whether they think something could be improved?  Or are we 
basing what we think works on how well they receive features that they 
have no influence over?

People say that WordPress was released too quickly.  I don't think this 
is phrased correctly.  I think that an inadequate testing duration was 
allotted for those last minute patches that were applied.  Nevermind if 
every single patch works flawlessly - What kind of policy is it to 
release as large a project as this without letting the code burn-in on 
testers machines for a few days?

We could keep pushing back the release date forever because the bugs 
would never end.  We would never release a new version.  Yeah, I get the 
idea.  Likewise, we could push the release back two weeks and allow a 
burn-in of frozen code to make sure those last-minute patches are 
working as expected.  Or, we could push the release back a month and 
have more complete documentation.  Clearly, a four-day release delay was 
valuable to the support folks.  In a delay's worst case, if none of the 
remaining bugs are addressed during that period, you have two things you 
didn't have before:  1) A more thorough idea of what is wrong with the 
release for use by support.  2) A firm, organized release date.

Real products have development cycles, where development is broken into 
phases that allow for discussion of new feature requirements, 
development of planned new features, testing of those features, and 
providing documentation and support for those features upon release. 
These cycles are not necessarily periodic (as in using a regular release 
date), but if are planned properly can be assigned a best-guess timeline 
that can be used for planning useful things like press releases, site 
design updates, and support ramp-up.

With a project this large affecting so many people, it seems about time 
that the development cycle of WordPress becomes a bit more openly 
scripted.  Otherwise we can continue as is: Guessing at new features, 
wondering if the new features are addressing the needs of users, 
speculating on release dates at the expense of complete documentation 
and support, and watching a growing unease among the project's most 
ardent supporters.

My belief is that nothing positive can happen if nobody says anything. 
I hope I have contributed positively by airing my thoughts on this 
matter, and I hope that my thoughts are considered and reasoned before 
hasty or pat responses are returned.

Yes. I've been thinking about this for the last few days and was at
the starting of writing an email similar to this, but you've put it a

I'd just like to point out that we haven't found any security holes
yet. That will save the embaressment we had at 1.5 with the stupid
amounts of incremental releases. I recall Matt saying that he was
getting some proper Security People to look at the software, I guess
it paid off.

Podz mentioned a six-month development cycle, and I think this is
reasonable. Say, a month after a release bugfixing and releasing
incremental, bugfix-releases. Five months worth of development, then a
month's worth of testing. Of course, we could chop and change this as
individual releases require, but it doesn't hurt anybody working to a
loose timetable. For the next major release, we need:

1. An announced planned release date, and we need to be told about it
about a month in advance, not four days.
2. Planned, strict, feature freeze, code freeze and translation-string
freeze dates.
3. Lots of time spent testing EVERYTHING. Twice.

+1. With regards to testing, I think there are two main problems with
the current WordPress test system.

1. We don't have enough testers. We have a few dozen people that are
loyal users of SVN, and they don't cover enough of the system. Stupid,
obvious bugs like author/ URLs not working and basic bugs in XMLRPC
made it through to the 2.0 release, simply because none of our testers
use this side of WP. If you are someone that has a multi-user blog,
uses XMLRPC frequently, runs PHP/CGI, IIS or anything else quirky, or
just in general would use some part of WordPress other than the 'core'
of writing posts, we need you as a tester. We need as many people as
we can testing as many aspects as we can.

2. Old bugs come up again. Due to WP's history, looking at the code
sometimes looks like it's a hangover from the old b2 days. Lets face
it, WP's code isn't as nice as, say, Wikipedia or Gallery. It's
improving, but it's still very coupled. New fixes tend to rebreak old
bugs. That's why I think we need some kind of regression testing. I'm
not sure how this would be embodied, perhaps through automated testing
(although that would require a BIG shift in the WP development
paradigm -- there's no point doing automated testing if you don't do
test-driven development), perhaps through ruthless human testing.
Whatever. We need to make sure that once a bug is fixed, it stays
fixed.

No, I'm talking about usability testing and usability issues. I know 
some people are confusing this with simple functional testing, but 
that's just a symptom of how poorly trained most programmers are w.r.t. 
usability issues. Fixing all the outright bugs would not fix the 
problems. In fact, it wouldn't begin to address the real issues.

I'll repeat: to design usable software you have to test with real users. 
The goal here is not to find bugs. It is to identify the software 
designer's misconceptions about how users understand and use the 
product. It is to identify the points where the UI is confusing and 
needs to be redesigned.

There are other kinds of testing, and they are valuable too for 
different reasons; but without serious user testing, one cannot design 
usable software. WordPress and many web based applications have gotten 
as far as they have only because the browser severely limits what 
developers can do, thus creating simpler systems users have at least a 
snowball's chance in hell of navigating. However, as AJAXian features 
are used to enable richer user interfaces, it becomes possible to design 
more complex interfaces; and, without a deep understanding of usability 
issues and testing with real users, the applications become too 
difficult to use.

To quote the eminent philosopher Stan Lee, "With great power comes great 
responsibility." If you're going to take advantage of the power of AJAX, 
you have the responsibility to use it for good, not evil. :-)

OK, I'm exaggerating here. The worst that's going to happen is that 
people will simply drop WordPress and choose a product that's easier to 
use instead. They aren't going to tell you they're doing this. They 
aren't going to explain why they're doing it. They're just going to do 
it. Usable software defeats unusable software in the marketplace. That's 
not an absolute rule, but it's a reasonable approximation to the truth.

New features should not be implemented without testing them on real 
people in the target audience, not just WordPress programmers. Old 
features should not be redesigned without testing them on real people. 
Otherwise you're shooting arrows blindfolded in the dark and hoping you 
hit the target. Only watching people use the software lets you find out 
what works and what doesn't.

Thank you, I hope everyone's reading this. Usability has oh so little
to do with programming.

Yes, but for the record, the stuff that should be adjusted whenever
needed should be adjusted by "experts", not 'some programmer' (all due
respect, of course, but know your place--and yes, I know mine). Bad
adjustments are as bad or even worse than no adjustments at all, which
is what we're aiming at here: a _better_ experience for everyone
(well, most anyway).

And with that in mind, I shall put my father to the task and let him
perform the Install, Write, Delete procedure and all that relates to
it directly. I'll try and report my findings and suggest improvements,
or at the very least points that prove troublesome.

Hey, Elliotte...

My understanding of how this goes is that you form a hypothesis about  
problematic areas of the interface based on your own experience and  
intuition, then you expose a test group to the application and take  
notes about their behavior without influencing their ideas about the  
application beforehand, then you poll them with a survey after the  
session to get their feedback about their experience.  Once a  
commonly accepted sized group of people has been observed and polled,  
you summarize and report your findings, proving or disproving your  
hypothesis?  Something like that..

I was able to help out the WP project with some programming for one  
of the theme browser sites.  This usability testing is probably well  
beyond my scope of expertise, but, it sounds like you have more than  
a passing interest, and maybe this is a great contribution you can  
bring to the project (beyond what you may already be contributing) ?   
You sure make a good case for the need for this kind of testing.  If  
you have the resources, your findings probably won't go unheard.    
You may be the best person to execute this kind of project.

The Codex is a wiki, so you could open a page up for ideas on a test  
plan and polling questions if you want input from anyone?  Just a  
thought.

I've noticed that there isn't a bugfix release branch so that features can 
cotinue to be added to the trunk. I think the wordpress development 
process is in great shape, in terms of openness, and response to tickets 
and patches. But a fundamental part of releasing a stable product is 
having a separate bugfix-only branch for at least several weeks.

Not that I can remember glaring examples of features being added durinig 
RC3 or RC2... maybe there were none. But I'm sure there were several in 
the weeks before release. And the structure of the respository does not 
encourage new features to be added by developers who might be wary of 
creating new bugs.

I propose that a 2.01 (or whatever the next bugfix release will be called) 
branch be created. Which I guess also means that I propose that a 
bugfix-only version be released in about a month :)

I once sat down to try to write a unit testing suite for WordPress, but 
soon realized what a difficult task it would be, due to [1] the coupled 
code, aka lack of separation of presentation and business logic (if I 
understand what you mean by coupled) [2] the unbridled use of global 
variables.

I hope to eventually put together an integration testing suite (at the 
browser-interaction level-- simpletest has good facilities for doing 
this). Which for many functions is basically what a unit testing suite 
would be, given the amount of environmental initialization that needs to 
be performed before each test.

I think an ongoing goal of WordPress should be moving toward a more MVC 
and OO model. Which isn't to say that a purist MVC model is necesarily 
ideal for this project. But just decoupling the business code from the 
display code, and trying to cut down on global variables, would go a long 
way in terms of code stability and maintainability.

1.5.x has it's own branch.

Right now, trunk is the bugfix branch for 2.0.  Only 2.0 fixes are going
in.  There is no feature development going on right now so no need for a
branch.  If I branch now I have to keep trunk and the branch in sync.
No point in that.

But there _could_ be feature development. There are probably a good 
handful of developers with spare cycles who don't have any bugs to squash 
and would like to work on what will become 2.1 (or whatever is released in 
6 months).

For WordPress this is a particular problem because no one has any idea 
when the next bugfix release will be, which discourages developers from 
even thinking about new features, and certainly from writing them. Who 
wants to work on a new feature only to have the changes sit on their dev 
meachine for a few months (actually, for a completely unknown time period) 
until the next bugfix version is suddenly released? I know that patches 
can be submitted and flagged as 2.1, but that ticket is going to sit 
around for a few weeks or months as well, where the developer misses out 
on feedback from other developers and testers, and also from seeing if the 
new feature interacts well with other features that other developers are 
developing.

For some things this could be solved by making feature branches, but since 
most of the new features in question are relatively small and iterative, 
the administrative and social overhead of created a branch for each little 
feature addition would not be worth it. Or there could be a new_features 
branch where all the new features went... but that's the point of having a 
release branch and an active trunk in the first place.

The traditional way to do this (from my own experience and reading anyway 
-- other folks please chime in with other models that they have used) is a 
2.01 branch, which would receive all the bugfixes and none of the 
features. New features would go into trunk. If you want to merge changes 
to the 2.01 branch into trunk, that's fine, although probably not 
necessary since the bugs at this point will be nuanced and rare. Changes 
to trunk would of course never be merged into 2.01.

So after making the branch, no merging needs to be done until 2.01 is 
released. At this point, the 2.01 branch will be [1] copied into a 2.01 
tag [2] merged into trunk [3] deleted.

There will be no feature development committed to trunk at this time.
People can development what they want, but it's not going into trunk
right now.  The focus is on 2.0 bug fixing.

The DBX script can do onchange AJAX calls, something to send this to a

Message-ID: <e6ec604d0601012131t659e122chee42e1e21d2df8f6@mail.gmail.com>

As long as it's a hot topic, let's give it a proper subject and proper
treatment.

The big idea is to keep a copy of the textarea on the server without
the user having to click Save. Let's settle on some details before
somebody jumps in to write the code. (It's a new feature anyway,
something that won't be put in the core at this point in the dev
cycle.)

I like Matt's idea of sending the content to a user option. I'd keep
it to one bucket per user so there is no extra UI required.

Here's a possible scenario:
1. User starts typing masterpiece in New Post/Page screen
2. At intervals of seconds or keystrokes, content is silently sent to server
3. Server saves it in that user's autosave bucket
4. Cat chews through PC power cord (any catastrophe will do here)
5. User switches computers, goes to Write Post/Page screen
6. Server sees autosave populated, gives user the option to recover
7. User clicks "Yes, please recover my typing!"
8. Server responds with New Post/Page screen with textarea populated
9. User dedicates masterpiece to dead cat and WP Autosave, clicks Publish
10. Server clears the user's autosave bucket on Publish or Save

The interval in Step 2 is a design decision or user option.

In Step 3, the content should be filtered (KSES, etc.) before saving.

Step 5 demonstrates how this is better than using cookies. (One of
many reasons.)

Step 6 can be via a JS confirm dialog but it might be more accessible
and less obtrusive as a message box such as we use for published
posts, saved options, etc.

Your ideas?

I do love the way that gmail does this. If I remember correctly, at
one minute intervals, gmail saves a copy of what you are writing as a
draft. There is a small, unobtrusive button, that lets you "Save Now"
if you just wrote something you really don't want to lose. You can
then close your browser, or browse elsewhere, come back, and pick up
where you left off.

I think that this would be the one major downfall, and is the thing
that I've hated about OpenOffice 2 since release, (although its not
quite fair, they're a desktop app). Instead of having some sort of
message that we detected an autosaved post, stick it as a draft, put
it up in the drafts area, and leave it be. Users will be able to see
that their post is there when they return, and the autosave feature
becomes useful for not only emergency saving.

In principle, you could also make use of the memory (e.g. the clipboard). As
Amit pointed out, any attempts to write to disk should be avoided. JavaScript
does not permit this and it would be the bad choice on alien computers.

Dumping copies to volatile memory wouldn't enable recovery from reboots. It
will, however, compensate for browser crashes, editting 'hiccup' and so forth.

I initially thought about a reserved post slug, which only serves as an
emergency copy, a last resort. This doesn't have to be anything
mission-critical. Users would happy enough be restore /any/ bit of lost work.

I wonder if mouse motion can somehow be detected without JavaScript obtrusion.
It might be useful here.

I can't say I agree. Users expect that message to come up. They know they have
lost work, so assuming a crash can be detected, a prompt would be a top
priority. Office suites do it and also a LaTeX editor that I use. It is
relieving to see that prompt rather than having to explore.

It's important never to suggest recovery under the wrong circumstances. 
If that
happens, it can result in data /loss/ rather than recovery. How to actually
detect crahes is a whole different matter which is equally important.

What do you think "the clipboard" is?  Maybe you're referring to the pagefile? That's also volatile memory... I'm lost...

If it has a post slug, or even just an ID which is what unpublished works have, then it has been saved to the database. Or are we referring to the clipboard again?

Only through Flash. Anything you do along these lines needs to incorporate javascript in some way if it is on the client side.

I'm not trying to be hostile and I don't mean to discourage your contributions.

I considered this but it runs up against the issue of the needlessly
autoincremented post ID. Plenty of people rally against this effect
whenever it occurs.

Gmail's draft system is very nice but to do the same in WP would be to
insert a row in wp_posts every time, not something I would do without
user initiative.

The bucket would be cleared every time the user saved or published. On
detecting the non-empty bucket, the Write screen would be topped by a
little box with a message and some links. The message could be worded
something like this:

Did you lose your work? Autosave contains XX bytes. <Recover> or
<Erase> (Autosave disabled until you click one)

<Recover> would populate the post_content. <Erase> would empty the bucket.

Until the clicked one or the other, the Autosave interval feature
would be disabled. This would keep the bucket safe from accidental
overwriting. It would incidentally keep the user from using the bucket
as a place for drafts. It might also necessitate a "Discard" button to
prevent an abandoned post from bringing up the message.

That is by far, the silliest idea I have heard for autosaving yet. We
should not be overwriting what a user has in their clipboard, this
does not scale cross platform (hell, Firefox won't even allow it).
This does not solve the problem of computers crashing,

Users who have lost work will know what to look for when its lost. A
draft with the same name as the post they were writing is notification
enough that hey, your draft was saved. We are not an office suite, we
are not a LaTeX editor, we are a webbased application, prompting is an
annoyance.

I'm not suggesting we insert a new row for every save, but rather the
initial autosave creates a draft, that draft can be converted to
published or whatever it need be when the user finally publishes, the
draft shows alongside other drafts when you visit the write screen. It
wouldn't really run IDs up higher than someone who writes drafts would
anyways. Potentially complicated, but I like it more than a single
save slot that could easily be unknowingly overwritten, perhaps by
someone working on two posts at the same time, or someone who takes
too long to click the link to the recovered draft on the post page,
and accidentally overwrites it with nothing (although, this could be
addressed in other ways).

They have a Clipboard Tool as well. Mac OS has it; KDE uses Klipper to 
retain a
stack of clipboards; older window managers have one too. I said "in principle"
because I don't believe this to be a good solution.

The clipboard is somewhat of a memory frame. And yes, they are all 
volatile, but
there have been times in the past when I lost work not due to a power 
outage. As
long as your work is somewhere in memory, you can pull it back. The 
question is:
should it be written to a remote computer (server) or should it be 
saved locally
somehow? Cookies are local, hidden fields are remote. What if you lose 
your post
because the server has just gone down? Some hosts are unreliable.

No, I was referring to an issue that was discussed before -- the issue 
of having
orphan posts in the database (these which used to be backups).

I agree with this approach. Instead of saving different versions of a
post, it can be made simple & effective by having it saved as a draft
every now & then & when the user comes back again, they can just
click the post link in the manage posts section & continue from where
he left. This way this feature will become more generalised than an
emergency recover feature.

Come to think of it, can't this be done as a plugin?

Roy, I was pointing against the idea of saving the draft in a cookie set 
by
Javascript. Here Andy was proposing to save the data to the server in 
the
database(if I didn't interpret it wrongly). The two are different & I'm 
in favour of
saving it to the DB since it won't compromise anything & it'll remain

And usually it causes unwanted drafts !

I am a beginner, i will start typing some things in WP and just some 
seconds later .. i decide not to publish or save them and close the 
Browser ! and te next time i come back to writing screen i will see 
those as Drafts there ... not interesting at all ;)

Saving as a user option and temporary is better .. i think.

Everyone has bugs to squash as long as there are bugs around.
WordPress is still small enough such that most devs are familiar with
most of the system; anyone can fix bugs. Hence, as Ryan pointed out,
all our efforts at the moment are focused on bugfixing. After a
designated period of time, we'll move into new feature development.

But before this thread dies I'd like to bring up the points of Owen's
email in the first place.

1. Our testing isn't good enough.
2. It would be nice to have a release schedule.

Are either of these problems likely to be solved?

Where is the problem there? wp_posts.ID is a BIGINT(20), which can
hold an enormous range of numbers, and I honestly can't see anyone
ever reaching its limit.

Why would you need to do that? Just treat an auto-saved article as a
draft, and whenever the "save automatically" event is fired (say once
a minute, or every 100 keystrokes), you update the existing draft
rather than inserting a new row - in other words it would have the
same effect as me clicking the "save" button. I draft nearly every
single one of the articles on my blogs, and I never have a problem
with needless rows in wp_posts.

OK, this is a very touchy subject for me (and for many others, I'm sure).
Now that a new rewrite system has been introduced in WP 2.0 that doesn't
rape the server when you have a LOT of pages, a whole new range of
possibilities is now open to webmasters. Me, for one thing, I am now working
on a game database site that will use pages as main information holders.
This will mean hundreds of pages. Yet there's only one problem: how to
search them?

Currently, there is no good page search plugin. The ones we have find stuff
that people didn't search for (this especially applies to sites using
non-latin characters), don't paginate search results (imagine if I search
for word 'platform' that will be on almost every single one of the pages on
my site), show entire page in results (this make viewing results a pain),
and so on.

This is why I am writing here in hopes that somebody might write one.
Suggested features (as mentioned above):

- Quality Page Search, that will fully support non-latin characters
- Paginating search results
- Ability to choose number of results per page in options
- Cutting off results after so and so many characters (can be settable in
options)
- Support for feed output
- Clean integration with current search system
- WP 2.0 support of course :)

Anyway, hope this will encourage some of the coders in the community to
write a plugin like this. There will be a lot of demand for it.

PS: I have also created a topic in support forums. Please feel free to
answer here or there: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/54221?replies=1

Regards.

I'm fine with a release schedule.  I think schedules and milestone
announcements draw in contributors.

Something like:

http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointThirteen
http://developer.kde.org/development-versions/kde-3.5-release-plan.html

Those schedules include string and UI freezes so that i18n and doc teams
have time to finish.  Note that those teams are involved during the
entire development cycle.  With WP, everyone waits for the release to
drop and then they jump on it.  We need involvement throughout, and we
need a schedule so that everyone knows how long they can
procrastinate. :-)

Who wants to write it?  There are various and sundry patches floating
about, but nothing comprehensive.  Some folks want to search comments as
well.  How do we bring it all together?

Yeah, people have been asking for page/comment search functionality since
before 1.2-ish. Yet the implementations never went any further than a buggy
plugin.

That's because it's not as simple as asking.  There's actually a fair
amount to consider.  Posts and pages usually display differently.  Pages
can have custom templates.  How do you handle displaying the results of

That's because it's not as simple as asking.  There's actually a fair
amount to consider.  Posts and pages usually display differently.  Pages
can have custom templates.  How do you handle displaying the results of
a search that contains both posts and pages?  Or even just multiple
pages for that matter?  Some pages are designed to be displayed on their
own as a full page.  Slapping their content into a search results page
would not look good and in some cases would be useless.  Do we show page
titles only then?  What kind of API will be provided to template
authors?  Will there be separate arrays for comment, post, and page
search results?  Will there be separate API for iterating over each

You can use Google API, I do it on my sites. Drawback: it's way too slow.

I've started setting the milestones to bugfixing bugs to 2.1 and for
non-bugfixes to 2.5. Are these reasonable names for milestones? Or
should we have 2.01 and 2.1 or something?

Doesn't have to be the final release name, just for bugs' sakes.

I concur. I like the idea that, while I am working, I can hit the "Save" 
button and NOT need to refresh the page. It's just saved!

I also like the idea that the draft I am working on is *automatically* 
saving every 1/2/3/whatever/never minutes -- whichever my paranoia calls 
for.

When I read the "one bucket at a time" thing, I too said "well, that 
works in a world where you only have one input, but the web is a 
multi-access media!" Would each user get thier own "bucket"? Can a 
higher access user edit/view/delete other people's buckets?

The concern was raised that auto drafting would cause post ID bloat. To 
be blunt, "So what?" Does your posts ID being out of sync (say, if you 
really didn't want that Cat Masterpiece) really going to be a problem? 
So it goes /post/11/ then /post/15/ (it was a very bad Masterpiece) -- 
what would that break?

Someone else raised the concern "Hey, maybe I don't want all these daft 
drafts sitting around" -- we have delete buttons for this. Wordpress is 
good, but it is not a mind reader. Either it save all your work 
automatically, or none of it. Not just "the good ones".

Amit mentioned that this could be done as a plugin -- probably. But if 
the focus of WP (as iterated many times) is to make a bloggers life 
easier ... well, life is a lot easier when you're not worried about 
whether you should be saving or not and you get to focus on just writing 
your piece.

Each user would of course get their own bucket, it's a user option ;)
Why would a higher-access user want to edit/view/delete other buckets?
It's a temporary dump location, not a place to store posts.

People don't like their IDs conspicuously increasing. Yes, ID is a
BIGINT, but people still don't like it, and will complain about it.

+1. This should be core. No-one needs crash recovery until their
computer crashes, then suddenly everyone needs it ;)

Might (or might not) be a "terms of Service" violation, but I bet you

2.0.1  is better for a pure bug fix release. 2.1 implies a more major 
upgrade for most.

[sarcasm] Just scrape Scroggle then. Stealing from the thief, that is.
[/sarcasm]

I'd say that creating a search engine which is internal to WordPress is
challenging for several reasons:

* Handling posts, comments, merging content, displaying highlighted
   excerpts and so forth.

* How can it surpass engines that are based on indexing? I use 'site:'
   quite a lot as it proves to be powerful under most circumstances.

* If you implement indexing, that's a whole project in its own right.
   When do you employ the server so that it carries out indexing? Can
   one re-use PhpDig perhaps? It's GPL'd. Perhaps someone could write
   a plug-in that integrates the two.

Robert: please see the previous thread about usability testing, and
getting real _users_ (not developers, not hackers, not power users or
tweakers) to test our systems.

I am willing to bet, based on my own experience helping _users_ that a
popup would be a welcome addition to helping them find their lost work.
 For those of us that know where to look, the argument can be made that
we know how to disable the popup reminder.

My mom _still_ composes in Microsoft Word, then cuts-and-pastes her
posts into WordPress, and asks me to review the HTML before she posts.
I guarantee you that a pop-up reminder that her saved post is available
will be a _good thing_.

What is not a big deal to you _is_ a big deal to others.  WordPress is
used by a lot of people because it allows them to display their blog in
the way they want.  People _like_ the /id/title/ permalink structure,
and many of them are anal about contiguous post IDs.  It is entirely
their perogative to use -- and rely on -- this feature.  A modification
that breaks this feature would be seen as a real bug for many many people.

I suggest that some of these questions be put to real users: both in the
forums, and to our friends and families who use WordPress but rely on us
to install/repair/tweak it for them.

One way around the problem of incrementing post IDs would be to store
the autosave stuff as a (couple of) serialized array(s) in usermeta.  It
could (with some effort) still be presented as a draft; and a popup
reminder could still be presented.  I am not suggesting that this is the
best solution.  I'm only throwing it out for further discussion.

Google is nice, but what happens if Google only crawls a user's page 
every 3 or 4 days? Old stuff would appear, sure, but someone looking for 
any newer content (or recent changes in old content) would be out of 
luck. Of course, that's assuming that the person is in Google's database 
in the first place.

If there wwill be things like this in the bug list:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2006-January/001695.html

I think that a 2.1 number would b more appropriate tha 2.01 cause the
add something a bit different that just bug fixunder the hood.

On the topic of a release branches...bear with me : ) -- is this not an 
example of something that, if developed over the next few days, cannot be 
committed to trunk for several weeks because we are doing bug fixes only?

I think along with this, we need a method of directed testing groups.
I know this idea seems a bit radical, but I'm sure someone can chop it
down to something acceptable. Let's say we create a new testers forum.
It includes such areas as Usability, RTE, XMLRPC, [insert new features
here], [insert other old features here]. For each forum, we have
sortof a dedicated group leader, whose job is to pay attention to
their respective areas of the forum, and report back to hackers,
testers, and trac on what needs fixing. Around release time, we ask
all of the group leaders to report back on if we're ready for release.
This way, we'll have a good idea whether or not everything has been
thoroughly tested, and we can immediately have a list of things
available from a larger number of people that needs fixing.

The amount of bugs and traffic on the testers list is too much for two
developers to handle alone, and possibly too much for Matt and Ryan to
make sane releases based on what they think is broken because there is
so much to consider at one time. By sortof moving the discussion into
the forums and just pointing some of the more relavant topics and a
higher level list of things that are working and not working back for
the devs to see, I think we'd be much better off toward picking when
it is a good time and when it is a bad time for release.

works too. the results are not very relevant, since mysql nat lang
functionalities are somewhat lacking. it works without bugs, however, and it
searches in pages. the layout is/should be a matter of creating a proper
search.php template.

as an aside, and for information, there are a bunch of open source search
engine projects:

I'm quite sure one of them could be used to enhance the default search.

It's connected to a bug, in the trunk actually the file interested use
old directory as in the wp-option table option if presente then all
ppl that will use it as it is now will get back to old method without
any warming and probably they have already images under the new
structure, this will be a mess, unless the commit modification will be
rolled back and this will be seen as a new features

I think this will be a great alternative to automated testing.
Although on the face of it it seems like we're going to need hundreds
of people to fill this out, we really only need five or six per
feature group, and the staffing can overlap so that we'd only need,
say, 50 testers. This will be a comfortable expansion up from our
current numbers and should really direct the bugfixing efforts.

+1.

I think this is all about users who dont use Clean URI (like /?p=15) or 
use Post-ID in their permalink structure !
they don't like to have some post IDs lost by Deleted Drafts.

I'm hesitant to put auto-saves or emergency recovery info in the posts 
table. The publishing model of WP is very different from Gmail. In Gmail 
you are composing until it is sent, then it's gone forever. In WordPress 
you may edit something constantly.

I wouldn't want in-progress changes to an already-published post to be 
auto-saved and shown to my users every minute or so. I also wouldn't 
want to post unpublished to a draft or duplicated to a draft. However it 
would be handy if my browser crashed while I was editing, I could 
recover that edited version of the already published post.

I'm not sold on the DB vs. cookies idea yet. I've been on a lot of 
high-latency connections the past month and there is something to be 
said for the instant nature of a local cookie store. (Yum!)

Surely it would be possible to keep existing posts and in-process edits 
separate? Whether it's an entirely new table or just an extra row in the 
posts table that's deleted when the post is published/deleted?

I hadn't thought of that.

I'm pro-DB in this case. What about storing the auto-saved data in a
custom field, rather than the "real" body? If the field is populated,
when the post is edited pop-up a warning box, or put a big field at the
top of the page (like we do when we change settings, for example)
informing the user that there is data to be recovered.

Since the custom field should never need to be human-friendly, it could
be a serialized copy of all the other fields as well, allowing auto-save
of title, slug, excerpt, etc.

Agreed, it should be put in the DB as a user option which will hold
only one lost post at a time.

I'm completely sold on the DB vs. cookies. For one, cookies don't
follow the user around to multiple computers, which seems to be an
increasing trend especially among teens. Second, cookies have a
maximum size (4096 bytes - overhead) which can be easily exceeded by a
simple article.

The time it takes to save to the DB is completely irrelevant as I see
it, because the save will occur asynchronously, in the background, and
will never freeze the UI at all. If the user saves the post manually
before the autosave request hits the DB, great. There's no conflict
introduced by being too slow.

The wp_autosave plugin I originally wrote a year ago and can't find
used this exact method -- saving to a user option row in the DB and
prompting upon entry to the Write screen to restore a saved post. I'm
going to look around for it some more, because it was 95% done and
working.

I thought that was nice too, only if I search for something using non-latin
characters, I get ALL pages on the site output as results, even pages that
did NOT include the word I searched for.

No, that's what I type into google when I want to search a site.  I
rarely bother with a site's built in search, even my own. :-)  I should
probably just put Adsense for search on my site.

I guess nobody noticed the new Page Search box under Manage > Pages?
It's for admins only but it works. The results are in a list of the
matching pages, never the actual content.

When I wrote that patch, I had to add a wpvar or two and modify a few
other things in classes.php. Hopefully somebody else can see this and
find it useful in making a terriffic search plugin. Hopefully such a
plugin will be so terriffic that it gets integrated into the core.

This isn't an area that's easy to reach with a plugin - or at least  
it wasn't (for me) in 1.5. I haven't looked in 2.0.

My hack was published here:

I've tried integrating mnoGoSearch without a ton of luck. I wanted to 
restrict it to just index the individual post pages rather than the 
day/month/archives views, but did not succeed.

Noticed same with a plugin of mine. I'm pulling category data from
the wp_object_cache object available through $GLOBALS* now:

$GLOBALS['wp_object_cache']->cache['category'][$cat]

-Kaf

* Unless someone can recommend a better alternative.

Should note in the above block [$cat] is (of course!) calling a
category from the cached array using the $cat global.

This keeps getting mixed up with searching for and finding bugs. This 
isn't about that. Allow me to summarize. There are two separate issues 
here, both of which need to be addressed:

1. Bug hunting: finding areas where the code does not behave as it is 
intended too. This can be addressed by unit testing, static code 
analysis, edge condition analysis, code inspection, and various other 
techniques. This is often the domain of professional testers and does 
not require end user participation, though if an end user finds such a 
big, great. This sort of testing can and should be automated.

2. Usability testing: finding areas where the code does exactly what the 
programmer intended it to do, and yet this is the wrong thing to do. 
This is where we need end users, because we cannot anticipate all the 
areas where they are likely to encounter problems. The question here is 
not whether the user interface behaves as the programmer intended it to. 
It is whether the design of the user interface fells natural to the end 
user, and allows them to accomplish the overall tasks in a 
straightforward, obvious, and convenient manner. This sort of testing 
really can't be automated, though it can be formalized.

Another difference: bugs are often binary. Either the bug is present or 
it isn't. Usability is more of a continuum. It's a question of more or 
less, not yes or no.

Hi,

does anybody have a vector version of the *new* WordPress Logo?
I mean the "W" in http://wordpress.org/style/header-logo.png
It would be good if WordPress.com would have a "Press" page
where you can find logos, feature summaries and all other

EPS would be the most platform agnostic out of those three.  PDF  
would be good, too.

This would be a good solutions, making a coordinator for every team

I can't see this being good. I have several drafts right now. Which one 
gets the autosave? Do I have to *pick* which article I choose to be safe 
with? What a hassel! Is it a rotating basis? What if I am editing two 
articles at once? What if (yes, it happens) I have a shared account and 
we're both editing at the same time? Who's piece gets the autosave space?

This idea of a single "bucket" was discussed futher up in the thread.




Matt, you raise an excellent point about not autosaving a 
'published'/'static' state post. That makes sense -- so saving that info 
serialized into a post meta field works nicely. When it's a draft, skip 
the overhead and just put the autosave data right into the table (or 
update if that post has an id already.)

Does anyone on this list actually object to post id's being out of 
perfect order? Or are the objections on part of 'others'?

If you are one of those people, do you never use the draft feature? 
(Surely, you couldn't with out incrementing your postid's out of order 
-- Lest you go through some major tomfoolery to get them back in order.)

Would it be sufficient to simply turn off the autosave? Would you feel 
like you're getting the shaft that you can't autosave without messing up 
your post id's?



In my opinion, this objection to what could be a incredibly useful 
feature, would deprive the majority of users a very useful feature while 
(as in many cases) simply catering to the "vocal majority".

Hi,

I need to be able to obtain the id of the requested category
when permalinks are enabled.

The method used under WP1.5.* no longer works and I cannot
find any hint as to where to look for the information under
2.0.

So, any pointers as to where this, and other information
transmitted via permalinks would be very gratefully
received...

Best regards

Untested, but you could add something like this to a plugin..


function get_category_by_name($catname)
  {
  global $wpdb;
  return $wpdb->get_var("SELECT cat_ID FROM ".$wpdb->categories." WHERE
category_nicename = ''.sanitize_title($catname).");
  }

If you want more than just the ID, you can do that by changing the query.

That what you're looking for?

$GLOBALS['wp_object_cache']->cache['category'][$cat]

I suggested that, but figured out another (purely WP) way:

global $wp_query;
$current_cat = $wp_query->get_queried_object_id();

You can also glean all of the category table data into an array
through:

$category = $wp_query->get_queried_object();

Have you tried checking out a newer revision out of subversion? I do
believe this has already been fixed.

Please don't do this.  If someone is using a replacement cache, this
won't work.  Plus, these are the sort of things that make plugins so
fragile to core changes.  If we need to add API, let's add API instead
of digging in the guts of WP.

What method was being used in 1.5 that is no longer working?  Can you
not use get_queried_object_id() or get_query_var('cat')?

No, I wasn't aware of anyone else having the same issue. Is there a bug
in the tracker? I did some searching but found nothing. Is this an issue
that affect everyone? Will an update but put out shortly?

The codex has sample code using $cache_categories, so how would one
know not to use it? http://codex.wordpress.org/Category_Templates

I need an array of the categories.  The hierarchy, ids, etc. that
$cache_categories provided was nice, too. I'd be happy to use a better
method.

Good grief.  That never should have been documented and needs to change.

You can work with get_all_category_ids(), get_category(), and
get_category_children().  We should probably add get_categories() that
works similarly to get_pages().

Could we make categories an array property of the post object so they  
are be easily accessed?

$post->categories

The post queries can pull the categories from the cache into each  
$post, then regardless of the cache used, all the theme and plugin  
folks need to do is access $post->categories.

wp_get_single_post() does this, but we should probably move this down
into get_post() so that everything is cached.

(Important note: I'm not angry, frustrated or anything of the sort. I
am just someone in search of answers, and maybe even solutions.)

What makes plugins fragile is when changes are made to the core with
no warning. Having $cache_categories available on category queries
worked. I'm sure there was good reason to pull it, and with other
methods I'm not arguing for its return, but we're getting to where
users can plan on any plugins of any complexity to break when a new
WP release hits. Even if it follows coding guidelines and implements
nothing but WP calls.

Is there a resolution to this? With the somewhat free form method of
coordinating development and disseminating information on core mods
which could break existing code, I just don't know. Certainly part of
it involves the participation of those of us working on plugins, but
it'd sure be nice not to have to test each of my plugins with every
large, and sometimes even incremental, upgrade. And with no guarantee
what worked in tonight's build will do so tomorrow, it can be a daily,
time-consuming effort if one wants to keep up.

Maybe I just need to vent--no, I'd prefer some slightly easier way of
managing my harem of plugins to make sure they're ready for WordPress
version Next. Sitting on my hands until after a release, waiting for
the flood of bug reports to drop in my inbox isn't a smart way to go
about it, but it's starting to look attractive...

Obviously it needs to change, but why should it not have been there?

It was in the core since (at least) 1.2.2. I know because I have a copy
set up for testing! It's there in 1.5.x. I can't find a comment or note
or mention of it having been deprecated, or requiring emergency surgery,
or anything.

Seriously, why does it require a Charlie Brown response?

I have no idea what arbitrary bits of WP plugins are digging into.  Some
dig so far down that just about any change made to WP will break them.
If a plugin is digging into the cache code, it should expect to get
broken.  The cache is off limits, and the abstraction of the caching
code should make that clearer.  In WP, everything is public so plugin
authors treat everything as fair game.  Everything is not fair game.  We
need to do a better job of defining and documenting the boundaries, and
plugin authors need to request API when there is something they need to
get at.  If plugins are accessing global variables and doing lots of
SELECTs, they need to make use of existing API instead or request API
where there is none.

This used to be mentioned on the WordPress "about" page, but I can't
see it there any more. A quick search of the support forums reveals
that the font is Dante:

http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/dante-mt/

Unfortunately it's a commercial font (why do free software projects
use commercial fonts? Debian does this as well) so you'd have to pay
for it or find a clone that was similar (not always too difficult, I'd
suggest asking in comp.fonts on Usenet).

Subject: [wp-hackers] comment management
Message-ID: <43BBD5AA.1040701@skippy.net>

How many people click the "Edit Post" link below each comment listed on
edit-comments.php?  I don't think I've ever clicked that link.

I've long wanted the ability to click _something_ on edit-comments.php
and be taken straight to that comment, rather than being taken to the
top post to which the comment is applied and then scrolling down.

I'm looking at submitting a patch, but I don't want to clutter the
interface.  Personally, I'd rework the bottom line of each comment
listed in edit-comments.php to look something like this:

Posted Jan 3, 9:53 PM | View | Edit | Delete ? Posted on ?Foobar?

View would take you to that specific comment; Edit would edit the
comment; and Delete would delete the comment.  The post title would be a
link to the post's permalink.

Alternately, one could make the comment's date a link to the comment
itself, but that seems less intuitive.

Anyone have any better suggestions?

That sounds useful.

A small wishlist of related feature improvements:

* Chronological sorting of comments in the listing.  (Or is it just on 
my site that these are sometimes out of order?)
* Highlighting new comments since the last time you saw the moderated 
comment listing.
* Clicking "No" on the "Are you sure you want to delete this comment?" 
page actually does something when coming from an emailed notice.
* Clicking on the emailed "Approve this comment" link takes you to the 
comment in the published post instead of the moderated comment listing, 
which no longer contains the reviewed comment or a link to the post to 
which it is attached.

It would be cool if users with moderate_comments capabilities could see 
all of the comments (moderated or no) directly on the site under each 
post, and could click on something in the comment itself to approve it 
via Ajax.

I'm going to go finish smoking the rest of this crack now.

I'm not sure if this is related but when reading the comments as just an 
ordinary reader--i.e. not the blog owner--I'd like to be able to click 
something to sort them ascneding or descending. Often when returning to 
a site with a lot of comments I want to read them most recent first 
rather than earliest first.

I also sometimes edit comments, which is why I am not proposing the
removal of the Edit Comment link.

I am proposing the removal of the "Edit Post" link.  Do you edit the
_post_ from the comment listings page?

Use a cookie to store the highest comment ID last seen?  I don't want to

Sorry. I was confused. I'm not sure exactly which page you're talking 
about, but if it's the one I think it is, then i think the answer is no.

As long as *a* post view link remains, I've no problem with your
suggestion. The few times I've edited a post under this scenario,
it was from following the "edit post" link on the post itself.

I do.. that is to say, I have done so in the past. Because when I
visit the comment listing page to reply comments, I occasionally need
to hastily put in a correction or an update to the parent post.

Having said that, I wouldn't be too fussed if the "edit post" link
disappeared. There's an alternative means of editing the post, so if
it reduces clutter ...

Yeah, where has all this talk about usability come in from? IMO this
has always been about finding bugs, and what Robert suggested is good.
It's been touched on that unit testing won't work for WordPress,
because we don't do test-driven development, and so writing unit tests
is a hard, long, boring process. What Robert suggested is probably the
best way to move WordPress QA forward, is there any chance of getting
this implemented?

As for usability, we don't need a centralised usability-bugs-finding
service. If you want to do a usability report (we've had one in the
past [1]), go ahead.

You make it sound like you dismiss the importance of good usability.
I'm not attacking you, but I will remark, undoubtedly backed by
Elliotte, that it _is_ important, and I'm not sure if we should have a
central service, but I do think we should have centralised ponderings
on this topic.

I think the intent of my original message got lost.

There is no escaping the importance of thorough bug testing, but let's 
set aside that issue for now.

I think that usability testing like that provided in the link above can 
be useful, but it's not what I'm talking about.  "Usablilty" in this 
sense is how well a user is able to navigate the interface.  That is 
useless when the features that the user wants aren't present or don't 
work.  WordPress developers need to take a harder look at what actual 
in-the-trenches WordPress users are doing with WordPress and then 
respond to their needs.

The primary response to the 2.0 release from people who are not 
upgrading is essentially this:  Version 2.0 offers me nothing I want 
that I don't already get from 1.5.2, and makes some of my more important 
plugins break, so why should I bother?

I suppose that many of the enhancements to WordPress are under the 
surface.  But it's pretty clear from the comments I've received that 
those features that are visible to users are not enticing them to 
upgrade.  Those users who were pleased enough by the upgrade that they 
felt compelled to comment were often vague in their reasons for doing so.

Amusingly, most people who have upgraded and commented that WordPress 
2.0 is good are people who describe the goodness as "The install went 
fine."  They don't provide the reason that they upgraded besides there 
being a new version to try.  I would expect that some would say, "I 
upgraded because I wanted the WYSIWYG editor."  I didn't see much of 
that at all.  The features that they liked surprised me, too.

The most-lauded new features of WordPress were the new included plugins. 
  Most folks didn't seem to care much about many other of the software 
enhancements.  Asking users not just what they want but how they want it 
to be done could have been useful in the development process.

What I'm suggesting is a complete rethinking of the WordPress 
development lifecycle.

First, we need to discover what the users want WordPress to do, and 
perhaps what users will want WordPress to do in the future.  Then decide 
on features to implement those requirements.  Code those features. 
Provide enough time for testing of those features, while instituting a 
support structure for it.  Getting thorough bug testing is only a part 
of a development plan.

I think these initial ideas about how to go about instituting better bug 
testing are pretty good, and we should follow through on them.  But we 
should do this as part of an overall development plan, not just 
something we slap onto whatever output the project ends up producing. 
I'm sure that a dedicated testing group would rather test bugs on 
features that they would want to have for themselves, and would produce 
better reports as a result.

I recommend the book "Software Project Survival Guide" by Steve C 
McConnell as reading for such an endeavor, which gives some advice on 
forming requirements for a project, and producing estimates for project 
duration.  This could be useful for producing a plan of attack for 
WordPress 2.5 or 3.0.

I'm doing nothing of the sort. Of course usability is important. I
just think that, because usability is more of a sliding-scale thing,
it's harder to have a ticket system like trac for it. Centralised
ponderings would be fine, of course.

I second that(that it would be cool), however I doubt the usability, 
since
people with such rights(to moderate comments) are more likely to go to
the comment moderation page & batch moderate the comments there rather
than in the individual posts.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Excluding from the Loop posts having a certain Custom
	Field
Message-ID: <b3522afe0601041213o48f65961q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post a support request, I
posted this also in the Forum, but I think that is a question quite
complex...

Well, this is my problem: I add a Custom Field to some posts to show
them in a news ticker in my blog header. The Key is 'ticker' and its
value is '1'.
Now, I want to exclude these posts from the Loop in the home, and show
only posts that don't have that custom field (ticker).
I tried with a custom query like:

$arts = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT P2C.*, POST.ID, POST.post_title,
POST.post_date
FROM $wpdb->posts POST, $wpdb->postmeta P2C
WHERE POST.ID = P2C.post_id AND P2C.meta_key != 'ticker' AND
POST.post_status = 'publish'
ORDER BY POST.post_date DESC");

but the problem is that if a Post has another custom field, the query
doesn't work, probably because there's more than a record in the
wp_postmeta table with the same post_id.

I could use this
$arts = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT ID,post_title,post_date FROM
$wpdb->posts WHERE post_status = 'publish' AND ID NOT IN (SELECT
post_id FROM $wpdb->postmeta WHERE meta_key = 'ticker') ORDER BY
post_date DESC");
but unfortunately doesn't work with mySQL version available on my
hosting service.

I read also the Query Posts Page on the Wiki, but it seems applicable
only to categories.

Any ideas?
Thanks in advance.

Isn't the document  http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6 meant to be a
wish list of what users want?

There's been approximately 180 edits to that article since April of 2005
giving that information some credence as to 'what users want.'  Granted,
some of those features made it into 2.0 but seems  a good many of those
ideas are still useful for creating a development plan.

Maybe the article should be renamed to something like "Requested Features"
and users should be encouraged to keep adding to the list.

Sounds like a good use for user-meta to me. This should be doable as a 
plugin...

Yeah, that would definitely rock. It would be a really cool feature for 
a theme to have :) Again, it could probably be done as a plugin, but it 
would require some work to make it play nice with arbitrary custom themes.

yes, sometimes a comment makes a correction or ads previosuly unknown

essential to have the link there, but useful.

The plan for 2.0 was to address three major user visible areas.  Two of
the most criticized aspects of WP were the user levels and image
uploading.  People griped about these all the time, and almost every
review of WP had those two things noted in the "Cons".  Improving them
was a priority.  The most requested new feature has long been a WYSYIWYG
editor.  This is a make or break item for many people.  So, those were
three areas of focus in 2.0.

Under the hood, the focus was on consolidating and modularizing code.
Lot's of stuff was moved into functions.  API was added for many backend
activities.  Much of this rework was for the benefit of importers, which
were another backend focus.  In prior releases, the importers were ugly
and difficult to author.  They had to do lots of heavy-lifting on their
own.  The new importers are much more compact and easier to understand.
There's not a single SELECT among them thanks to all of the new backend
API.

That was the development plan, such as it was.

It might be complex in certain ways, but the question isn't 
wordpress-specific. This question is more appropriate for an sql list or 
irc channel.

I'm assuming by that you mean that your hosting service is running mySQL < 
4.1 and therefore can't handle subqueries.

you can just do two queries:

$tickerposts = $wpdb->get_column("
         SELECT post_id FROM $wpdb->postmeta WHERE meta_key = 'ticker'
");

$tickerposts = implode(',',$tickerposts);

$arts = $wpdb->get_results("
         SELECT ID,post_title,post_date
         FROM $wpdb->posts
         WHERE
 		post_status = 'publish' AND
         	ID NOT IN ($tickerposts)
         ORDER BY post_date DESC
");

Thank you, you were very kind. Now the query works fine.
Just one note: there's a little error in query

> $tickerposts = $wpdb->get_column(" ...

it should be

$tickerposts = $wpdb->get_col(" ...

:-)

Thank you very much indeed, John.

Subject: [wp-hackers] overriding the built-in cache
Message-ID: <43BC963E.2090408@skippy.net>

I am having some trouble with my wp-cron plugin, and I'm pretty sure
it's the new caching mechanism that's causing it.

WP-Cron stores three values in the options table:
   wp_cron_15_lastrun
   wp_cron_hourly_lastrun
   wp_cron_daily_lastrun
Each of these is a timestamp of when the corresponding function last
ran.  The wp_cron_init() function, which executes at plugins_loaded,
loads these values and compares them to the current time.  If the
current time is sufficiently past the last run time, a shutdown action
is registered.

For WordPress 1.5, this mostly worked.

With WordPress 2.0, though, I'm seeing much weirdness.  For example, I
added the following, as a test mechanism, on my test site:
add_action('wp_cron_hourly', 'sdm_test');
function sdm_test() {
   $cron = get_option('wp_cron_hourly_lastrun');
   mail('skippy@skippy.net', 'cron hourly', "cron: $cron\ntime: " .
time() );
}

_Every_ visit to my test site sends me an email, even if it is not yet
time to run the hourly action.

I then modified wp_cron_init() to call wp_cache_flush() if it is time to
run a cron job.  That failed, and I still get the test email with every
page view.

Even uncommenting DISABLE_CACHE in wp-settings.php does not work: I
still get an email with every page view, even though the current time is
less than wp_cron_hourly_lastrun + 3600.

I've skimmed wp-includes/cache.php, but I confess that I don't quite get
how it works yet.

How can a plugin bypass the cache on a programmatic basis?  Is it even
possible?

With DISABLE_CACHE set, caching falls back to 1.5 behavior where all
options are pulled from the DB and stuck in memory.  The persistent
cache is not used.  So, this *should* be the same as 1.5.  You can dump
the output of $wp_object_cache->stats() somewhere and compare that
against what is in the DB.

I might add wp_cache_disable() and wp_cache_enable() for use by
importers which need to circumvent all in memory caching.  I wouldn't
suggest plugins disable the cache in such a manner. Instead we should
fix whatever is wrong.

An optional argument to get_settings() could be added: $use_cache = true.

I thought one of the options this discussion in #wordpress produced
was to use a direct query via $wpdb: did this not work?

I haven't gone the direct query route yet, because of Ryan's comments in
the category cache discussion:

join query.  In some cases these queries were taking 10-15 seconds  
each!  wp-cache2 helps, but those slow queries were still going through.

The next solution I looked at was MySQL's qcache, which caches  
queries.  The problem here is that the main post query uses " AND  
post_date_gmt <= '$now' "  ... and $now changes on each load.  qcache  
requires the query to be identical for it to be served from the query  
cache.  And then I though... WHY does $now need to reflect the  
current time?  The reason that $now is there is to prevent future  
posts from appearing, so why not just make that date reflect the date/ 
time of the most recently published post?

So, I wrote a plugin to do just that.  It updates an option with the  
date/time of the most recent published post (updated on edit, save,  
publish).

It made a HELL of a difference.  The main post query, when grabbed  
from the query cache, now takes less than 1/100 of a second, as  
compared to 3-15 seconds before.

Here is the plugin:
http://txfx.net/files/wordpress/post-query-accelerator.phps

And attached is the my.cnf (MySQL configuration file) in use.  What  
do you think about putting something like this in the core?  It can't  
hurt, and it can really help people who are utilizing Qcache to  
relieve stress on high traffic sites.

Skippy,
You are running your plugin on the shutdown function, as I recall.   
add_action('shutdown' 'your_function'); or something.

Here is the relevant code in wp-settings.php:
> function shutdown_action_hook() {
> 	wp_cache_close();
> 	do_action('shutdown');
> }
> register_shutdown_function('shutdown_action_hook');

Notice that wp_cache_close() is called before your function is run.

wp_cache_close() calls $wp_object_cache->save() which appears to take  
all the changes that have been made, and writes them to the cache.   
But because you do your update_option() after the saves, they don't  
make it in.

Try running wp_cache_close() at the end of your shutdown function,  
and see if that helps to commit the changes.

Would it be useful to sneak another hook in before the cache gets 
written to disk?  Say, 'pre_cache_close'?

Probably better to just save the cache again after the shutdown hook  
is run.  If there's nothing to save, it should be really quick, and  
it's a shutdown function anyway, so it shouldn't contribute to page  
delay.  That would be the most backwards-compatible way of doing it.   
I thought about just moving the query save function to AFTER the  
shutdown hook, but that could be dangerous.  Shutdown functions don't  
output errors to the browser when they screw up, so they're hard to  
troubleshoot... and (at least, AFAIK) if you get a fatal error before  
the cache is saved, you lose the changes that were made.  So my vote  
goes to sandwich the shutdown hook between two cache saves.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2232

I didn't make a sandwich because two consecutive calls to
wp_cache_close() might not agree with other cache backends.  It's fine
with the default cache, but we can't assume the default cache is being
used.

Message-ID: <4147dc600601051854u71937a60he073440005d5c6ae@mail.gmail.com>

Was just wondering - would the creation of a new irc channel be good
at this time? Something like #wordpress.com ? Maybe there could be a
java(eck! I know) IRC client on Wordpress.com that would let users ask
questions live?

I think one way wp.com can really shine is by providing good support,
and since #wordpress focuses more on supporting the actualy wp code,
shouldn't there be another channel to sort out problems like "How can
I edit my themes?".

Over the past few weeks I've seen such questions asked in #wordpress
and found it to be sort of off-topic for the channel. Or maybe it's
just me.

Thoughts, anyone?

Nothing  prevents you from initiating activity in that channel, but I sup-
pose  you seek to 'advertise' its existence. There are support forums  for
Wordpress.com,  but  they are in beta and currently inaccessible. I  guess
patience is a virtue here.

<offtopic>
I'd be interested to hear (offline) your success on tuning a 256MB VPS... 
I've avoided moving to a VPS as 512MB seems needed if you get cpanel/plesk 
(for those of us somewhat-linux-impaired folks!), and those are expensive 
plans -- comparable at times to a low-end dedi.
</offtopic>

That's a really great solution you came up with, and fits nicely with other 
internal caching approaches.  If 2.0 hasn't done something similar, might be 
worth considering... BUT...

There's a strong alternative: don't filter based on post date at all, and 
move future-posts out of the 'normal flow'.  Future posts already want to 
ping when they 'arrive', so the same cron/timing facility could actually 
change a post state from, say, 'future' to 'publish' when the post time 
passes.  That'd eliminate the extra query param entirely from the 'average' 
query (I could see wanting to filter by date for other reasons... but I 
think this'd all work nicely).  Thoughts?

This is certainly an interesting optimization strategy-- designing a 
system/schema around the idea of changing the generated sql queries as 
infrequently as possible in order to maximize cache hits. If the 
future-post system was changed in core to have the behavior of Mark's 
plugin, which would cut a big query out of every front page hit of a 
WordPress blog, think of all the sql processing that would be saved all 
around the world! :) Also, I wonder where else in wordpress we could do 
something similar?

I  believe that a better solution would be to send a message  periodically
to  state  some guidelines. This can be automated. It's very common  among
newsgroups  and in /large/ mailing lists it is often necessary and is less
distracting. It also adds little 'noise' to the archives.

The  subject  line is often engineered to grab the attention  of  newbies.
However, it often tends to be skipped, discarded or disregarded. It is ef-
fective,  however, as group subscribers can point to it whenever 'etiquet-
te'  is not honoured. There are scripts for achieving this, but I  suspect
Mailman has the capability built in.

The only thing that worries me about this is that plugins might be  
acting on future-published posts by looking for post_status =  
'draft' ... I can't name any off the top of my head, but it's a  
possibility.  Otherwise, post_status = 'future' would be great... we  
could just drop the post_date_gmt <= '$now' part altogether.  This  
would even make the first (non-cached) MySQL query faster!  AFAIK,  
that thing is a part of pretty much every post query, so a LOT more  
queries become cacheable when you do away with it.

I've been hanging out in #wordpress.com for a few weeks but the only one

Mailman already sends a password reminder on the first of every month,
could we tack it onto the end of that?

Could you use MAX(post_date) instead of that extra query? I'm not too
sure what functions work on datetimes...

People can opt out of monthly password reminders. It is a per-user option,
which can be altered by the subscriber. I can't find anywhere in the panel
where  the message can be changed. It might be worth setting up a  monthly
E-mail job which is directed at the list.

Another option, as John suggested:

Mailiman -> [Non-digest options] -> Footer added to mail sent to regular list
members

Excellent!  This appears to have done the trick for me.

Ok...sounded like an interesting idea. But you guys want my username
and password? You need to come up with an alternate way of publishing.
This will NEVER fly.

How big do these mp3 files get?

Maybe you could setup a user who has very limited access and use it  
to post? Obviously you wouldn't want to do this from your main admin  
account and what not.

Never say never... There are plenty of services that ask for similar 
info, and plenty of people who provide it.

Has Flickr solved this problem with the way they allow 3rd parties to 
authenticate against their system?

I don't know Wordpress very well so it's difficult for me to offer a good
workaround.  Is it possible to create a user that only has post privileges
and none of the admin stuff?

There are other options, for example creating some code lives on your
wordpress server that polls phoneblogz.com for new posts, but this makes
setup of each individual site much more complicated, and I'm trying to make
things easy.  It would also mean that support of further systems because
increasingly complicated.

I'm always open to ideas!

Matt

At the moment the MP3 file is roughly 1.5kb per second.  Obviously there are
a myriad of options in MP3 encoding to reduce the size at cost of quality,
but this seems a good size for the moment.  Plus the encoding I'm using is
directly compatible with Macromedia Flash which gives us further options for
playback.

Sounds like you need an API for the service. That would ultimately mean
fewer systems to support and open up for developers to write
extensions/plugins for whatever service or site they want to use.

It's a thought anyway. Sounds like a great service.

Oops sorry for the blank reply.

 

An API wouldn't be difficult to do - however, storing all the MP3s on our
server is something I was hoping to avoid where possible as the more storage
we need, the more it costs me!!

This isn't boot camp or grade school, we can talk to eachother
off-list without fear of the drill seargent or the teacher.

If you politely reply to the sender of whatever message offends your

Yes, they now use a secret, token/fob system for users to grant access to
programs on a program by program basis. So, if you decided that you didn't
want a specific application to use your credentials anymore, you can deny it
access. More information can be found:
http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.userauth.html

However, keep in mind that since flickr is a controlled service (e.g. it is
only ever in "one" location), they can afford to use the model that they
have in place. With distributed installations of wordpress (with the
exception being wordpress.com) other logistical alternatives might need to
be looked at since keeping all authentication on many different servers
provides just as many challenges, if not more, than just having it on only
one.

Hope that helps,
Ryan

That was a great read. Are we supposed to volunteer in the talk page or

Thanks for the input.  What I was hoping to do is use the already-present
methods of posting, ie XMLRPC (why reinvent the wheel?).  This makes it easy
for many reasons, but from a security point of view there are obvious
issues.

 

I'll probably end up providing modules for various pieces of software
(Wordpress, Drupal etc) but allow users to also use direct posting if
they're OK with the security issues.  Hopefully that'll keep the majority of
people happy.

 

Thanks again,

 

Matt

Has Flickr solved this problem with the way they allow 3rd parties to
authenticate against their system? 



Yes, they now use a secret, token/fob system for users to grant access to
programs on a program by program basis. So, if you decided that you didn't
want a specific application to use your credentials anymore, you can deny it
access. More information can be found:
http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.userauth.html

However, keep in mind that since flickr is a controlled service (e.g. it is
only ever in "one" location), they can afford to use the model that they
have in place. With distributed installations of wordpress (with the
exception being wordpress.com) other logistical alternatives might need to
be looked at since keeping all authentication on many different servers
provides just as many challenges, if not more, than just having it on only
one. 

Hope that helps,
Ryan

If you really want to accomplish anything, you'll send mails and
feature requests to all webmail services and e-mail clients that put
whitespace above replies and the cursor at the start of the text, like
gmail, which makes it a natural to hit reply -> type -> and send,
which top posts.

Overall I think a monthly reminder will just get ignored or discarded, and 
might even confuse users who aren't used to such emails on email lists. 
They will assume it is something administrative/technical and disgard it.

It's possible, but it doesn't seem to be happening, or if it is, it's not 
effective. The last time this was brought it it wasn't done in a very 
friendly manner, and many people still top-post, either because they 
weren't Converted, or they didn't read those messages.

What you say about "sensibilities" is actually what I'm getting at... 
right now the issue comes off as a personal sensibilities issue, a quirky 
email war that surfaces every few months... What I am suggesting is that 
the administrators of this list articulate a casual, friendly, 
informative, approachable, and (thankfully) unenforceable anti-top-posting 
policy.

Just an idea... :)

Your situation is not uncommon.  I already use audioblogger.com to do 
exactly what your service does.  It uses XMLRPC to post to blogs, too.

Flickr doesn't use the method previously described when it posts to 
WordPress sites - it, too, uses XMLRPC.

In fact, implmenting XMLRPC posting is a best bet, since WordPress' 
support for XMLRPC is mostly mimicking what other blog tools already do 
with the Metaweblog API and similar protocols.  It's not a bad bet that 
you'd be able to most to MT using XMLRPC set up almost exactly like it 
is for WordPress (with the minor exception of the blog id).

For users who are concerned over security, you can easily create a new 
user on your site with its own password and grant it only draft-writing 
permissions or authoring permissions.  This can be done in either WP 
1.5.2 or 2.0.

The login will be ineffective for doing anything but writing new posts. 
  Anyone who blogs enough to want to call their blog is probably going 
to notice if a service does the one bad thing that it could do with that 
level of permissions and starts posting willy-nilly.

I've knocked up a quick Wordpress plugin that will let you view your
PhoneBlogz and manually post them to your blog.  It's basic at the moment
but I'd really appreciate it if someone could give it a go and let me know
your thoughts.

The plugin is at: http://phoneblogz.com/api/wp-phoneblogz-0.1.zip


To install:

 - unzip the phoneblogz.php file into wp-content/plugins
 - activate the plugin in the admin pages
 - under "PhoneBlogz configuration" enter your access code and pin number
that was e-mailed to you when you registered at phoneblogz.com

To test:

 - call an access number (http://www.phoneblogz.com/help/howcanipost.php)
 - enter your access code and pin number then leave a message
 - go to the PhoneBlogz Configuration page and click "Check for messages"
 - if all goes well your message should appear.  Click "post now" to post to
your blog


Of course there's tons of stuff to add:

 - automatic polling of phoneblogz
 - more configuration (category, post title, MP3 link or Flash player etc)
 - better status information


Let me know!

Message-ID: <000e01c613d1$3cb44ea0$6e01a8c0@sixfour>

I've got a website I help with, and we're looking to upgrade (for a whole 
host of reasons) from an earlier 1.5 release.  General opinion is to move to 
2 immediately, but having watched the number of issues (and fixes!) coming 
through I'm leaning toward a 'nightly' from the 2.0.1-trunk rather than the 
2.0 release.  Looking for opinions.

Assuming '2.0.1-unstable' (SVN HEAD) is fixing notable issues in 2.0, I 
can't see installing the 'release' over the 'unstable', given that 
'unstable' might actually be more functional and 'stable'.  Planning to do 
this tonight probably, not looking to wait more than another day...  The new 
object cache could make a big impact given the pagehit count (already 
installed WP-Cache...).

Discuss! ;)

Thanks,

Message-ID: <042238D6-8339-46C8-BC5B-126011E50238@txfx.net>

I'm going through the new hooks in WordPress 2.0 and adding them to  
http://wphooks.flatearth.org/ and I stumbled upon two hooks that are  
redundant: create_category and add_category.

They're both fired in the same place, right next to each other, and  
don't appear anywhere else in the code.  Should one of these be  
promoted above the other?  create_category appears to be the one that  
is new for WordPress 2.0... was there a reason it was created?

Also, while we're on the topic, I totally want to be in charge of  
hooks when we start dividing up the QA stuff.  I'm going to be an  
expert on it when I get done with the hooks database.

I enabled the WordPress 2.0 backup plugin and tried to backup. I got 
these two messages:

WARNING: Your wp-content directory is NOT writable! We can not create 
the backup directory.
/var/www/cafe/wp-content/backup-05ad9/

1. Why is it trying to writing anything to /var/www/cafe/? 
/var/www/cafe/wp-content/backup-05ad9/ I understand, but /var/www/cafe 
shouldn't need to be written.

2. Why isn't it using /usr/tmp for temporary files like a good Unix program?

3. Is there any way to configure it to tell it to use this location instead?

I'm very nervous about making directories world writable just so 
WordPress can muck with them.

It's checking whether it can create the directory it needs.

WordPress is not a good UNIX program, it's a web-based application.  It
might be running on Windows, in which case /usr/tmp is a bogus value.

You can edit the plugin as needed.  Line 22:
define('WP_BACKUP_DIR', 'wp-content/backup-' . $rand);

As am I.  I started a thread about this just before the 2.0 release.
Matt's official response was "wp-content was always meant to be writable
by the webserver".

The last time I had to do that I added his name, email, and ip (it was

those, he eventually gave up harassing me.

Hi,

first of all you need to include the Javascript stuff, which isn't 
available on all pages by default. Maybe it wasn't intended that 
plugins use this functionality?

<script type="text/javascript" src="../wp-includes/js/dbx.js"></script>

After that you have to create a DBX manager, which handles and 
saves the state (closed/open) of the parts. The dbxGroup object
contains all settings and the ID of the container which contains
the parts.

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
    addLoadEvent( function() {
        var manager = new dbxManager('unique_id_for_your_plugin'); //session ID [/-_a-zA-Z0-9/]

        var your_plugin_group = new dbxGroup(
        'id_of_your_container', // container ID [/-_a-zA-Z0-9/]
        'vertical', // orientation ['vertical'|'horizontal']
        '10', // drag threshold ['n' pixels]
        'yes', // restrict drag movement to container axis ['yes'|'no']
        '10', // animate re-ordering [frames per transition, or '0' for no effect]
        'yes', // include open/close toggle buttons ['yes'|'no']
        'closed', // default state ['open'|'closed']
        'open', // word for "open", as in "open this box"
        'close', // word for "close", as in "close this box"
        'click-down and drag to move this box', // sentence for "move this box" by mouse
        'click to %toggle% this box', // pattern-match sentence for "(open|close) this box" by mouse
        'use the arrow keys to move this box', // sentence for "move this box" by keyboard
        ', or press the enter key to %toggle% it', // pattern-match sentence-fragment for "(open|close) this box" by keyboard
        '%mytitle% [%dbxtitle%]' // pattern-match syntax for title-attribute conflicts
        );
});
//]]>
</script>

Note that you have to give some elements the right IDs for
the correct look (blue background, the + and - signs etc).
The parent container element of your group must have
"advancedstuff" as the ID for example, because the styles
are hard coded for these elements IDs :(

Maybe this could be changed in future releases to generic
class names?

Best regards,

  Arne

Then why doesn't the message mention /var/www/cafe/wp-content instead of 
/var/www/cafe ?

Java has a platform independent means of finding the temporary files 
directory and creating a temporary file. Does PHP? Even if it doesn't it 
shouldn't be that hard to figure out if we're on Unix or Windows and 
choose the temporary directory accordingly.

I can't answer this one, as these changes were put in by Matt.

Using a system-wide temporary directory is probably a bad idea, since
the database contains password hashes, non-public email addresses, and
possibly unpublished posts which should remain private.

The backup should be considered private, and as such should not be
spooled to any publicly accessibly directories.  Yes, I realize that the
instructions in my original plugin did encourage people to relax
permissions on their /wp-content/backup/ directory, but that was mostly
due to problems with various hosting providers.  Matt's modifications to
use /backup-<hash>/ help obfuscate the backup directory from casual
snooping.

Subject: [wp-hackers] hook availability 
Message-ID: <005901c61490$5f90d050$57ebd4cb@unicorn>

is there a way by which a plugin can check whether a hook is available 
or not?
I mean something along the lines of PHP's function_exists() function
which I think would go quite a bit in helping plugin authors create
backward compatible plugins and/or check whether the hook/filter
they want exists or not & display appropriate message to the
user incase the hook/filter is not available.

There are really only two ways to do this right now.

A) Check against the version, which is stored in a file, and output
your messages accordingly.

B) Have your plugin make dummy functions to run at the hooks you want
to check against. On shutdown, if your functions haven't been run, you
know that hook isn't available in the codeflow of the page you are
visiting (I say this because obviously certain hooks aren't always
run).

They don't need to be world-writeable, just writeable by the web
server. chgrp them to your Apache group, then chmod -R g+w wp-content.

That doesn't really assuage my fears. My server's basically a single 
user box. If anyone gets through and logs in besides me, chances are I'm 
already hosed. But mostly everything's pretty solidly firewalled off. 
So, barring breaking and entering to get physical access to my box, the 
one real point of attack is the web server and WordPress. If someone 
manages to get into the web server or Wordpress somehow, I'd like to 
know that they couldn't thereby start defacing my web site or sneakily 
modifying the code in WordPress.

Okay, so chown them to your apache and set some insane permissions
like 600. You can't ask for more than that: WordPress _has_ to be able
to write to the dirs for things like the cache and image uploading to
work, there's no getting around that. Incidentally though, things in
wp-content and .htaccess are the only things that need to be
server-writeable.

Yes, but it would be better if directories that contain code would not
be writable.  This would go a long way in preventing attacks that try
to deface the site or run unauthorized code by replacing existing code
or adding external code.

For example, if wp-content is writable, malicious code could rename
the plugins or themes directories and insert its own code.

If wp-content and the plugins and themes directories are write protected
this cannot be done.  The downside is that you cannot upload plugins or
themes using the web interface, but you can still do it through FTP or
shell access or however you got the WP files in place to begin with.

The first thing I've run into so far that insists on wp-content being
writable is the backup plugin.  I don't see why it couldn't just use
a subdirectory like the object cache does.

If a wp-content/backup directory was used as the base directory for the
plugin (instead of wp-content), users could opt to create it manually
and make it writable by the web server.  Since files in the directory
are not executed as code or otherwise displayed on the site, it is not
quite so bad that it is writable.  The backup-XXX directories still
preserve the same security-by-obscurity as before, provided the base
directory cannot be listed (which is best achieved through proper web
server configuration).

Fortunately it is easy to modify the base directory in the plugin, so
there is no reason to lose the excellent value it adds.  I just think
this is one default value well worth reconsidering.

Regards,
+ Kimmo

I would advise against committing this patch as-is. There are already
some hooks that only exist if the theme author was keen enough to use
them, such as wp-head and wp-footer. We saw a significant fraction of
themes missing these hooks since 1.5 and we'll see more.

There is also the remote possibility that another plugin purposefully
interferes with any given hook by removing all actions/filters from
it, rendering that hook useless. Remote, but not inconceivable.

It is unfortunate that hooks are not centrally registered. Your most
robust option is to work with Robert's scheme, like so:

add_action('some_hook', 'test_some_hook');

function test_some_hook() {
 $hooks = get_setting('hooks_test');
 $hooks[] = 'some_hook';
 update_option('hooks_test');
}

add_action('some_filter', 'test_some_filter');

function test_some_filter($input) {
 // See above
 return $input;
}

Just don't do this on every page load or you'll run up the query count
needlessly!

Which is a great excuse in 2.0 for these specific hooks not to be added 
using the built-in array, but via the the functions.php of the theme - 
since the theme should tell whether it provides the hook or not.

The reason I want to this info is because my plugin adds some stuff  
in the wordpress write post page, where custom fields is. I don't  
know if this is of any help, or if it changes anything. otherwise  
you've been very helpful and I will try everything you said as soon  
as I still some time. :)

Any sort of has_hook() function would be more for finding out what  
CORE hooks are available.  Yeah, people can put a function in a hook  
that doesn't return, or do something else to interfere with hook  
operation, but that's the risk you take when installing untested  
plugins.

Yes, I could update the patch to reflect WordPress 2.0, but it might  
be good to get some sort of indication that this is going to be  
considered for commit, before I do so.

Until then, I've updated http://wphooks.flatearth.org/ to show all  
the new 2.0 hooks, which are also in their own category.

Not all of the files are using the tab convention.  Before the 2.0  
release, I went through and fixed a some of the files, especially the  
wp-includes/*-functions.php type ones... but there are plenty more  
that are using spaces.  I'm going to continue to work to do "cleanup"  
runs on the code whenever I have time... so the next major release  
should be even "prettier."

When submitting patches, try and follow the coding conventions, and  
maybe look at some of my "massive code cleanup" patches to see the  
kind of things I was correcting, regarding tabs, and other spacing/ 
whitespace issues:

Subject: [wp-hackers] pre_ping hook placement
Message-ID: <34CAE746-8C8E-414C-8A10-0D6D03CEAD49@txfx.net>

pre_ping is a new hook for WordPress 2.0

Its placement seems very bizarre to me.  Observe:

> 	foreach($post_links_temp[0] as $link_test) :
> 		if ( !in_array($link_test, $pung) && (url_to_postid($link_test) ! 
> = $post_ID) // If we haven't pung it already and it isn't a link to

> 				&& !is_local_attachment($link_test) ) : // Also, let's never

> 			$test = parse_url($link_test);
> 			if (isset($test['query']))
> 				$post_links[] = $link_test;
> 			elseif(($test['path'] != '/') && ($test['path'] != ''))
> 				$post_links[] = $link_test;
> 			do_action('pre_ping',  array(&$post_links, &$pung));
> 		endif;
> 	endforeach;

The do_action() is inside of the foreach loop, which means that it  
gets run multiple times.  But it passes a reference to the entire  
array of $post_links and $pung URIs each time it is run.

So if an entry has these three links: http://site1 http://site2 and  
http://site3 ... something using that hook would first get http:// 
site1, then get http://site1 and http://site2, and then get all three  
links.

Is there a reason it was placed here?  Seems to me that the place  
place to put it would be AFTER the foreach loop.  It makes sense to  
me in that context.

It's very likely that no one is using this hook, as WordPress 2.0 has  
only been out a few days.  Any objections to moving it?

That really ticks me off.  At least in Yahoo! mail, you can choose 
whether to post replies to the top or bottom automatically.  I get lazy 
when using my GMail account and then get retroactively mad at myself for

A few thoughts:

First off, the DBX code isn't strictly Ajax.  There is no communication 
back with the server.  Even the storage of the positions of the boxes is 
using cookies on the client.  An example of Ajax on the post page (the 
only one I can think of, actually) is the adding of new categories.

The problem with DBX is that the thing that makes DBX run is loaded via 
the addLoadEvent() js function in admin-header.php:

function addLoadEvent(func) {
   if ( typeof wpOnload != 'function' ) {
     wpOnload = func;
   } else {
     var oldonload = wpOnload;
     wpOnload = function() {
       oldonload();
       func();
     }
   }
}

Notice how func() is called after the old oldonload().  That means that 
anything you add to the queue is executed sequentially *after* what has 
already been loaded.

Unfortunately, there isn't an easy place to insert a new addLoadEvent() 
call before DBX inserts its own.  The reason you would want to do this 
is so that you could insert a new div into the main DBX div so that the 
DBX code would manipulate it, too.  Because your new div can't be inside 
that main div before DBX initialized, you've got a problem.

There isn't really an easy solution.  There might be a hook in the 
output chain before the DBX script tag that's added in admin-header.php, 
but I don't see it.  A superior solution would be to add a new hook to 
the core that's inside the DBX area (and also to the one on the side).

These type of hooks weren't added before because you could use DOM to 
insert new elements whever you wanted.  But because of the new dynamic 
interface, this becomes more problematic.

I have added a Trac ticket with a patch for adding the described hooks:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2250

For folks who don't want to wait for a new hook, check out my very own 
brand of insanity:

There is also the fact that trac seems to convert hard tabs to spaces ;)

Message-ID: <ebe43d680601091126j3aef56acq@mail.gmail.com>

A discussion came up today on #wordpress with a guy who blogs in
German. Umlauts are stripped from slugs, and he wants them replaced
instead of stripped completely. In German, it's acceptable to write a
vowel with an umlaut as [vowel]e, so ? -> ae, ? -> oe and so on. Could
we employ some code like this in remove_accents()?

The only problems I see are with other languages that use umlauts,
like skandinavian ones. I'm not sure what the rules are here for
rendering umlauts, but they're probably not the same as German.

I've looked through the archives and it seems this issue has not been 
brought up.

Using WP2.0 no trackbacks are sent upon posting (this is from both a 
fresh install and an upgrade install).  Trackbacks will be sent 
intermittently by running execute-pings.php in your browser after 
posting.

Pingbacks work as intended.

I said before that it's not a translation issue but now I'd say the
translators should add filters to handle this kind of thing in their
translation plugins. If they need more API, they can have it.

The scandinavians would absolutely hate it if WordPress were to do
the German ae/oe thing to ? and ? in the slugs.  The current behaviour
of using a/o is correct.

Now, I wonder if the french would like ? written as ee any better?

Btw, a plugin already exists for the German way of slugs.

Right, the current behavior is fine for English but any language pack
should be able to customize this filter appropriately. Thus French
users will not be affected by what German users do.

Message-ID: <43C31BD8.3040807@skippy.net>

We had a conversation some time ago about access keys, and keyboard
shortcuts.

I'd really like to speak privately, in a dark alley, to the person who
decided that ALT+D as a shortcut for the <del> tag was a good idea.

I use ALT+D in Firefox all the time.  But WordPress grabs this from me,
even when the edit box _does not_ have focus.

At least a month passed between the last change to the accesskeys and
the release. If you use it all the time, why didn't you speak up? I'm
not partial to Alt+D. Submit a patch. It's in
wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/editor_plugin.js IIRC.

I'd really like to do the same to whoever decided alt+d has anything
to do with the location toolbar. Oh, right, that was Microsoft.

Ctrl+L makes so much more sense.

It is not far from the alt key though, so needs two hands assuming Alt Gr;
CTRL has a different meaning and isn't cross-platform IIRC.

The convention is that the first letter should be picked for accelerators,
but if occupied then move the second ("d" in address). You're looking at
terminology issues like Favourites and Bookmarks, Location and Address. At
least Microsoft have settled for the same RSS icon as Firefox...

For the record, Netscape used the word "location", not "address". As I
launch Netscape 4, I see that alt+L is the binding for location.

Speaking of Alt+D, I thought that the mailing lists suggested that it should
be left untouched due to Internet Explorer. I can vividly recall that
thread. Some people complained about that binding.

doesn't F6 do just the same? It's only one key instead of ALT+D and at

I have just been informed about a site in our University which had been
hacked. It is WordPress 1.2.2 and it isn't run by our Division,
fortunately. The site is finally back to its feet, yet stripped down to its
raw state.

Do not be alarmed. Read the bottom of the page (Google Cache should
temporarily hold the evidence):

http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:vr4l-xsQyz0J:www.muls
.man.ac.uk/+muls+law+society+manchester&hl=en

or the shorter URL:

I thought it was worth a chuckle or at least serve as a lesson. Sorry if it
is completely irrelevant to this list.

That's not really the point. A lot of people will be used to using
Alt+D, and we can't exactly tell them that this one site they visit
has to change their browsing habits.

Message-ID: <DOMAINPGtPrPrvCWO6h00000010@domain.usa.tricycleinc.com>

I've modified the plugin and made it a little less "beta".  This plugin lets
you post an audio file via phone straight to your Wordpress blog using the
PhoneBlogz system.

When you leave a message at PhoneBlogz, the system notifies your Wordpress
blog by calling a single page.  Your system then polls Phoneblogz for new
messages and posts them when found.  Hopefully this is a good start at
avoiding the security issues previously mentioned.

As always I'm really interested in hearing your thoughts and feedback so
don't hesitate to get in touch.

The plugin can be found here: http://www.phoneblogz.com/api/wordpress.php

Many thanks,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Wordpress 2.0 trackback issues
Message-ID: <7d4f9d1e5163f8e090d1ceb5f05fd448@imaginekitty.com>

Many of us are having issues sending trackbacks using WP 2.0.  Some 
claim they are not but are perhaps confusing trackbacks and pingbacks.

This is not the issue with whitespace in the to_ping field in the 
wp_posts table because after you publish and the trackback fails you 
can go to wp-adming/execute-pings.php and it will usually send the 
trackback (still seems intermittent).

I know execute-pings.php is being called because the pingbacks are 
going out just fine but the trackbacks never work until you call 
execute-pings.php alone after the post is published.

I've been messing around with execute-pings.php (both modifying it and 
calling it in different places but I've had no luck yet.

I've had minor success by making the posting form action go to 
execute-pings.php then having execute-pings.php redirect as needed but 
then it seems to ignore pingbacks and if you have more than one 
trackback only one gets sent.

It has been rather frustrating.  Has anyone got any ideas?

Thanks

If you mean you're calling execute-pings before publishing, this won't
work. The post form must be handled first so that the db records are
there to be found by execute-pings.

I'm trying to replicate this problem and having very little luck. My
trackbacks are being sent when I publish.

I'm sorry I was mistaken.  That was a failed attempt.  What I did that 
actually worked was link execute-pings.php to the "View site>>" link.  
And then redirected execute-pings.php to the index.php.  That is still 
spotty as mentioned before.

Sorry, I've been mulling over this since Dec 31 with 100% failure on 
the trackbacks without calling execute-pings.php separately (and that's 
still spotty).

Okay, but it works on many systems with 100% success. What's different
about your setup?

Absolutely nothing.

You may have missed the first time I posted to this list.  Maybe some 
other information could help.  1.5 trackbacks and pingbacks fine.  2.0 
pingbacks fine.

2.0 will trackback from my home server but fails on the host server 
(which I am running 1.5 on now with 100% success).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Nasty get_option()/get_settings() bug
Message-ID: <9D0B918F-B632-4F9F-AB49-EEAA18A7B58A@txfx.net>

Thought I'd open this bug up for discussion here.  This is a new bug  
that was introduced with WP 2.0's option caching.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2268

The short version, is that get_settings() ( alias of get_option() )  
caches non-existent options as FALSE.  So if i do get_option 
('this_option_does_not_exist'); it will get cached as the result from  
the $wpdb query... which is FALSE.  Now, when asking for this option  
again, the following condition is evaluated, after setting $value to  
the value of the option according to the options cache.

> if ( false === $value ) {

And if that condition is true, it tries the query again.  So, if I do  
get_option('this_option_does_not_exist'); 100 times on a page load...  
I'll get 100 identical queries.  Ugh.

So what we need to do is come up with a way to discriminate between  
"option isn't in cache" (and therefore, make the query) and "option's  
non-existence has been cached" (and therefore don't make the query,  
because we know it doesn't exist).

I was thinking about having wp_cache_get() return NULL for values not  
in the option cache, so that FALSE can mean FALSE, as it would if you  
had queried the database for the option... but I'm open to suggestions.

The way it used to be done is have a seperate cache,
$cache_nonexistantoptions or something, that stored the names of
options that don't exist. This was checked before querying the DB. Is
this not done now?

I really don't think it is my server because trackbacks are sent out 
when you call execute-pings.php in your browser.

OK, I think I'm onto something here.

When I apply the pre_ping_FIX.diff to comment-functions.php (listed 
here: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2269 )

AND place execute_all_pings();
  before _e('Done."); in execute-pings.php
I can send both trackbacks and pingbacks from the same post.

I have not tried multiples of both yet but this is progress.

I was thinking we should serialize ALL options (so we can store
booleans) and stop relying on get_* functions to tell us that an
option doesn't exist. It would be a cinch to write a function
option_exists() and start serializing all options.

This would also reduce some of the confusion that develops when
escaping/unescaping strings for the database.

Message-ID: <9b1b9dab0601111020o7c89a3eax70d751bb1dac25f4@mail.gmail.com>

I tried #wordpress and the forums with no luck so far, so I will ask here:

How can I post an HTML formatted post via the XML-RPC interface? If I
post the HTML code it gets converted to entities. If I preconvert
content to entities, it doesn't get converted back (obviously) :) 
I've made this work with a couple of direct db inserts, but XML-RPC
would be much cleaner and not subject to as many changes I would have
to keep up with...

Plain text posts work fine using this code, formatted posts from other
XML-RPC clients work fine.

I am using PHP with the xml-rpc library. Example Code:

$content = "<p><strong>bold Statement</bold></strong>;
$xmlrpcurl = "http://127.0.0.1:2006/devwp/xmlrpc.php";

$client = new xmlrpc_client($xmlrpcurl);

$params[] = new xmlrpcval("n/a");
$params[] = new xmlrpcval("n/a");
$params[] = new xmlrpcval("admin");
$params[] = new xmlrpcval("chrislottt");
$params[] = new xmlrpcval(
"<title>LinkLog</title>".
"<category>2</category>".
$content);
$params[] = new xmlrpcval("true");

$msg = new xmlrpcmsg("blogger.newPost",$params);

I think the library you're using might be part of the problem:

http://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/doc-1.1/ch05s04.html#d0e886

Try using the IXR Client and see if that works ok for you.

Still...  Having looked through the IXR library, can anyone confirm that 
encoded entities passed in XMLRPC values are properly decoded?  The 
XML-RPC spec seems to imply that entities in XML should be decoded by 
the RPC server, which kind of makes sense.  If it's not doing that, it 
should.

And what about UTF-8 support?  The XML parser isn't created with UTF-8 
turned on, so I wonder if it's doing the right thing.

I think a good principle we might be falling away from is that WP has 
always been easy to hack and integrate with other systems by talking 
directly to the DB using simple SQL. Just something to keep in mind when 
making decisions like these.

There are so many funky bugs related to NULL/FALSE in PHP I would almost 
have a "magic" reserved value that means the option doesn't exist or 
bring back an array like we had before as David pointed out.

Part of the problem is some options might not get loaded until later due 
to the autoload setting. Fundamentally we're doing two things with 
options: storing settings needed all the time and also using it as a 
generic "stuff dump."

It doesn't seem to be, but then it MUST be because with other clients
the HTML comes through fine. Here is code using the IXR library and I
am getting the same result... HTML entities in the post:

include('IXR_Library.inc.php');
$client = new IXR_Client('http://127.0.0.1:2006/devwp/xmlrpc.php');


if (!$client->query('blogger.newPost', '', '', 'admin', 'chrislottt',
'<title>LinkLog</title><category>2</category><p><strong>bold
statement</strong></p>', 1)) {
   die('An error occurred -
'.$client->getErrorCode().":".$client->getErrorMessage());
}

echo $client->getResponse();

The problem is not with execute-pings.php. The problem lies in the 
function that calls this script. If you have a row in your 
wp_posts-table where "to_ping" has some faulty data in it, the function 
hangs in an endless loop and never executes the trackback (calling 
execute-pings.php) ... you can see this in your webservers logfile.

The problem is described here:
http://blog.serv.idv.tw/2005/12/29/380/
and here:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/54145

and was fixed here (at least for me):
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3384

Greetings,
Sebastian

Yeah, that could work.  Return "%WP_OPTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST%" or some  
such if the option does not exist in the option cache.  Then, instead  
of checking for $value === false, check for $value === "% 
WP_OPTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST%" and only do the query in that circumstance.

It's hacky, but it's relatively uncomplicated.  As long as our  
"magic" string is obscure enough that it will never be legitimately  
used, it should work fine.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Responsibilities
Message-ID: <43C5963F.1080205@mullenweg.com>

The first draft of the division of responsibilities in WordPress that 
was discussed at the meetup last week is ready:

http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Responsibilities

Here's how we can do this:

* Discuss things here on wp-hackers
* Edit the page like you would any wiki page but,
* Add any entirely new sections at the bottom

To volunteer create an unordered list after the responsibiltiy you want 
to volunteer for. It should have a short sentence about how much you can 
help out (as a leader, helper, cheerleader), how many hours a week you 
are willing to commit, and of course your username so other people can 
contact you. Here's an example in wikicode:

'''XML-RPC / Atom API''' - Testing for popular XML-RPC clients (Ecto, 
w.bloggar); development of WP's standard posting API support.

* I would like to lead this. I have every XML-RPC program for Mac and 
use them all regularly. I can help out 5-10 hours a week. - Matt 
Mullenweg (matt)

Feel free to signup for something even if someone else has already, the 
more people working together the better. It's also possibly someone 
might flake out and so it's best not to have any responsibilities on 
just one person.

You can volunteer for multiple things.

Thoughts?

define('WP_FALSE',
'%WP_OPTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST_23I47239856Y34YHJCXHFLKDSHLTASHD%');

return WP_FALSE...

if($value == WP_FALSE)...

or, we could do s/false/null if anyone preferred that.

Non-existant objects are cached per request within WP_Object_Cache.
Look at WP_Object_Cache::get() and ::set().  However, false is returned
if the object is non-existant.  This means that we will avoid multiple
attempts to find the cache file for a non-existant object, but
get_settings() will still try to hit the DB every time.

A magic value might work.  We need to avoid using NULL to mean "not
there" since $wpdb returns null for empty strings -- a valid value for
some options.

Is there a difference between the capabilities edit_post and edit_posts, 
or is one a typo? Both are used all over the code... I never see anwywhere 
where edit_post is granted with add_cap though.

I imagine I'm missing something, since edit_post is used so often, but I

edit_posts is a generic cap that says a user can edit posts, in general.
edit_post is more specific.  It is always accompanied by a post id and
means that the user can edit that particular post.  edit_post is a meta
cap that looks at whether the user can edit_posts, edit_others_posts, or
edit_published_posts to determine if the user can touch the given post.
See map_meta_cap() in wp-includes/capabilities.php for details.

Maybe the Translations section should include theme and plugin too,
working with the leader for this section to ensure that theme and
lugins that come up in the WP showcase will have to be I18N too, to
form a solid base of multilanguage stuff for WP

Can we forward this to wp-testers? I'm sure a lot of people would
volunteer there. At least they can volunteer to test, if not to code.

Hi All,

I've nearly finished work on a multiple languages plugin (phps attached
[still alpha - not for production sites!]) and have found a couple of
places in the code where I could do with a bit more flexibility, hook-wise.

The main area is rewrite_rules.  As it stands, I'm having to redefine
all the permalinks in Gengo::rewrite_rules (line 61 onwards) using
rewrite_rules_array because I can't see a way to add rewrite rules
before the first call to generate_rewrite_rules.  This works, but isn't
a good idea because it'll overwrite rewrite rules placed by other
plugins, I have to write a new rule for every view instead of making use
of the built-in ones, and also isn't futureproof.

What I'd like to have is a way of calling

$wp_rewrite->add_rewrite_tag('%language%', "(en|jp|fr)", 'language=');

which is on line 75 and adding %language% programmatically to the end of
each permalink structure *before* generate_rewrite_rules gets to work.

Somthing like this:

function generate_rewrite_rules($permalink_structure, $paged = true,
$feed = true, $forcomments = false, $walk_dirs = true) {

$this = & apply_filters('rewrite_codes', & $this);

$permalink_structure = apply_filters('permalink_structure',
$permalink_structure);

// Do Generating Stuff.

}

Then:

function my_rewrite_codes_function(& $rewrite_object)
{
$rewrite_object->add_rewrite_tag('%language%', "(en|jp|fr)", 'language=');
return $rewrite_object;
}
add_filter('rewrite_codes', 'my_rewrite_codes_function');

And:

function my_permalink_structure_function($structure)
{
return $structure . "%language%";
}
add_filter('permalink_structure', 'my_permalink_structure_function');


This would allow for far more flexible structures than we have now, if
I've figured it out right, at only the cost of two hooks.

There's one more thing, though.  Because of the way date rewrite rules
are generated, I don't think it's possible to add custom entries to
anything other than onto the end of the last section:

ie: /%year%/%month%/%day%/%language%/ can be generated, but
/%year%/%month%/%language%/ and /%year%/%language%/ can't.

I get round this at the moment by repeatedly calling
generate_rewrite_rules with walk_dirs set as false (lines 76 - 86) , but
it would be nice to say 'Append my tag onto any possible view' and just
have it happen.  I think this could be achieved by seperating out the
date generation logic, but I haven't looked into it too closely yet.

Maybe instead of:

$date_rewrite =
$this->generate_rewrite_rules($this->get_date_permastruct());
$date_rewrite = apply_filters('date_rewrite_rules', $date_rewrite);

We could have:

$number_of_tokens = preg_match_all('/%.+?%/',
$this->get_date_permastruct(), $tokens);
$tokens = $tokens[0];
$date_rewrite = array();
while ($number_of_tokens--)
{
$permalink_structure = '/';
for ($i = 0; $i <= $number_of_tokens; $i++) $permalink_structure .=
$tokens[$i] . '/';
$date_rewrite += $this->generate_rewrite_rules($permalink_structure .
'%language%', true, true, false, false);
$date_rewrite += $this->generate_rewrite_rules($permalink_structure,
true, true, false, false);
}				
$date_rewrite = apply_filters('date_rewrite_rules', $date_rewrite);

Is this feasible at all?  I'd be happy to create a patch with all of
this if it could be added.  I have a working version of the plugin
without any of these alterations, but compared to the rest of the Plugin
API (which I have to say is really fantastic compared with when I
started) it feels hacky.  Would be interested to hear what people thought.

Cheers,

Jamie.

By the way, this file will only work with the latest revisions as it
makes use of the new dbx hooks from the other day.

Oh yeah, and Ryan, that revision to stop the overwriting of $request
seems to be working well, thanks!

Hi,

I want to write a WordPress plugin. The codex means
that I have to release it under GPL or a GPL
compatible license. Why?

The problem is that I don't want that anybody 
copies my plugin, adds some lines and sells it.
As far as I understood, the GPL allows this.

Is that true? If not, is there a human-readable
description of the GPL and its derivatives?

Or may I release my plugin under creative
commons licence?

Thanks,

  Theodor

Because the GPL is intended to preserve freedom.  Efforts to restrict 
freedoms work against the purpose of the GPL.

The GPL FAQ might help, too:

Any GPL-compatible license will satisfy the GPL:

The GPL lets people "sell" copies of your plugin or anything they make 
based on it, but it also requires that they give people the same rights, 
and let people freely distribute it.  So it's unlikely that they would 
make much money doing this :-)

Cheers,
Phil

As far as I know, the GPL does allow them to sell it, but also requires
them to release the code under the same license, which means you should
always be able to get it for free.  Nobody sells Wordpress, do they?
What people sell is support and services - that's where all the real
money is anyway.

Besides which, it's good for the soul to do something that others can
use freely :D

I release mine under one of the MIT licenses - it's GPL compatible, I
won't make any money, but my name should stay on the top.  That's enough
for me, at least.

Jamie.

Of course, it only takes one person to bite the bullet and buy it and  
redistribute it.

Hi,

There's a filter and action pair for the edit.php table,

'manage_posts_columns' and 'manage_posts_custom_column'

but could we have the same kind of pair for the edit-pages.php table too?

'manage_pages_columns' and 'manage_pages_custom_column'

or something?


Cheers,

Jamie.

I need to read over your proposal more carefully, but I think we can
accommodate.  Probably not for 2.0.1 though.  I don't want to risk
adding permalink bugs in a maintenance release.  If you want to work on
a patch, I'll look it over for future inclusion.

That's cool,  I wouldn't have expected it in this release really.
Better safe than sorry.  Anyway, I think I'm close to having something
workable, so I'll send it over when I'm done.

Reasonable hook requests such as this are rarely (ever?) turned  
down.  Write a patch quick, and it might make it into 2.0.1!

I'm actually right in the middle of doing just that!  But, the logic for
edit-pages is pretty... obfuscated.  It looks like it was a copy and
paste job from page_rows(), or the other way round.  I'm having a go at
  cleaning it up now.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comment Abstraction
Message-ID: <43C7AF9D.9020506@midnightcircus.com>

While working on a project recently, I noticed that although there are 
many functions for abstracting post fetching from queries, there are 
none for doing this with comments.

For example, functions like get_posts() let you fetch a set of posts. 
An entire class, WP_Query, has features for retrieving posts without a 
developer having to write any SQL.  And in among those functions and 
classes there are a dozen plugin hooks for altering what they return.

Conversely, comment retrieval is primarily accomplished using SQL 
queries.  As such, hooks for modifying what they return would need to be 
inserted wherever a query was executed.

The method for retrieving comments using a template's comments.php is 
not so transparent, either.  A variable, $comments, simply shows up out 
of seemingly nowhere to provide the comments for a post.

My suggestion as a core enhancement for 2.next is to provide abstraction 
functions and a first-pass set of plugin hooks to filter comments.

Anyone else have opinions on this?

Done!  This patch adds hooks 'manage_pages_columns' and
'manage_pages_custom_column' that are the equivalent of
'manage_posts_columns' and 'manage_posts_custom_column'.  You can call
them in exactly the same way, using the same callback functions:

add_filter('manage_pages_columns', 'my_manage_posts_columns');
add_action('manage_pages_custom_column',
'my_manage_posts_custom_column', 10, 2);

function my_manage_posts_columns(& $post_columns)
{
	$post_columns['gengo_language'] = __('Language', GENGO_DOMAIN);
	return $post_columns;
}
	
function my_manage_posts_custom_column($column_name, $id)
{
	// Check it's our column.
	if ('gengo_language' != $column_name) return;
	echo get_language_by_id($id);
}

As a side effect, it also now displays the Owner column correctly in all
cases, which it didn't seem to do in the past.  It seems to present the
table correctly in all the situations I could throw at it, but it did
require a bit of code shifting around because of the way the logic was
set out previously, so please test it out and see how it goes.

+1.

would also make it possible to replace comments with say forum posts, 
transparent under the hood without changing a line of template/theme code.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [help] sink plugin hooks for $this references in
	WordPress 2.0 ?
Message-ID: <cd3f14da0601131217j4dd20266s@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sir or Madam,

In the Codex it says:
***You can also sink plugin hooks to object instances. Here is an example of
how to do this using the class above:*

*$mailer = new emailer();
add_action('publish_post', array(&$mailer, 'send'));*

*Whenever a post's status is set to "Publish", WordPress will execute the
send() method of the $mailer object. Used this way, the class can make use
of $this-> references, whereas the static calling method above can only call
the class methods statically using the scope resolution operator.
*

I am doing this
$lbnh_installer_reference = new loadbalancer();

add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php',array(&$lbnh_installer_reference,"installer"));


And I am also getting a confirmation that the constructor of the
loadbalancer class has been run, however it doesn't run the installer
function.
I am doing this, because I am wanting to use $this references within the
class.


Help would be nice or maybe this isn't possible in Wordpress 2.0 anymore?
I actually posted this in the wordpress.org support forums (@
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/56213) and David Chait suggested I should
ask on this list.

I appriecieate any help and/or pointers.

Kind regards,
niels hackius

The first parameter of add_action() or add_filter() should be a valid 
plugin hook name.

Apparently, you're not supposed to use add_action() for that one at all:

This lack is also related to the incessant problems with comment
counts. When we've finally centralized comment handling, the count
should come under control as well.

Incessant problems with comment counts... yes. MarkJaquith and I had to 
fix this on my site the other day. The dashboard was correct in listing 
that I had 332 posts, the Manage > Categories table insisted that I had 
471 posts in the default category. Maybe a re-working of the whole 
comment system would help to cure some of this.

Yes,thats correct. In fact me using the add_action is just a shortcut, since
register_activation_hook<http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/register_activation_hook>()
basically just strips the filename of the plugin. However the function
plugin_basename() that register_activation_hook() utilizes returns a wrong
slash on my system. (It actually returns "samba\loadbalancer.php" where it
should be "samba/loadbalancer.php" - but this might me okay, since it is a
testsystem on windows xp)

My problem isn't really that the hook doesn't work its more that I can't
pass a classvariable by reference

This way it works:
add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php', array('loadbalancer',
'installer'));

this way however it doesn't:
$test = new loadbalancer();
add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php', array(&$test, 'installer'));

it also doesn't work this way:
$test = new loadbalancer();
register_activation_hook(__FILE__, array(&$test, 'installer'));
...as the website you pointed to suggested.

So it appears that what I am trying to do is just not possible? I was just
wondering.

Thanks for all the help.

If $test is a global variable that should work.

As a side note, instead of using a singleton when activating the hook:
add_action('publish', array(&$singleton, 'function'));

You can do this:
add_action('publish', array(&$this, 'function'));

... as long as you call the add_action from within the class.  For  
some classes, there is no benefit, but with some other classes,  
people might want to start up a second instance, and this allows them  
to do so, because you haven't hardcoded the singleton object's name  
into the class.  Plus, it's just good coding. :-)

That was category count, not comment count.  Although they do both  
work in similar ways.

This would obviously be a consideration for WP 2.1 or beyond, but how  
do you all feel about comment meta data?

In the same way that data can be attached to posts with Custom  
Fields, I've wanted to attach meta data to comments.

The data for all a post's comments' meta could be fetched with one  
query, and quite quickly, if the wp_commentmeta table has a "post_ID"  
field as well as a comment_ID field.

I had an idea for a plugin that would require this:

The plugin would allow you to specify an additional field to be  
filled by commenters for a specific post.  For example, on a post  
about WordPress 2.0, you could add in a field for "I am currently  
using WordPress Version ____" and then have a dropdown list of  
options.  The question and the options and the "requirement" switch  
would be stored in the postmeta.  The commenters' answers would be  
stored in comment meta.

This would also work well for my Subscribe to Comments plugin, which  
currently adds another column to wp_comments to store the  
"subscription" status.

It'd add one more query on is_single() and is_page() requests.

Thoughts?

+1 from me. Just today I ran across an instance when I thought, "Gosh, I 
could use some comment meta data here. Oh well!"

If you're still having problems you could try adding the action using just a call to
LoadBalancerClass::installer like this:

add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php', array('LoadBalancerClass', 'installer'));

installer() {
	global $test;
	// Install Here
}

It's a hack, not particularly pretty and of course you have to declare $test global because you can't use $this
inside the 'installer' function, but it might work for you.

Cheers,

If you use add_action() from within the class, $this is perfectly fine:

<?php

class myTestClass() {

	function myTestClass() { // constructor
		add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php', array(&$this,  
'install');
	}

	function install() {
		// do install stuff here
	}

}
$singleton = new myTestClass;
?>

Yes, but from what I understand, Niels is having problem with references.

The line I gave,

>> add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php', array ('LoadBalancerClass', 'installer'));

can be called _outside_ a class, at the bottom of a plugin definition file, which may or may not help.
If I remember correctly, this is how UltimateTagWarrior adds its filters and actions.
But, if you do that, you _can't_ use $this inside the registered callback functions.

The problem is not references, its where he calls add_action.

Mark Jaquith wrote:

The problem is that $this is a special variable reserved for being
called inside the class. You cannot use $this at all outside of the

The key to fixing this, is to move the add_action call to the
constrictor of the class.

I know about $this and I'm pretty sure we're saying the same thing.  Both of the following methods
are possible.  The first is much cleaner, but the second is still valid and works.  I wasn't saying
you should do it, just that it could be done!

<?php
class myTestClassA() {

    function myTestClassA() { // constructor
        add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php', array(&$this,  'install');
    }

    function install() {
        // do install stuff here
    }

}
$singletonA = new myTestClassA;

class myTestClassB() {

    function myTestClassB() { // constructor
    }

    function install() {
	global $singletonB;
        // do install stuff here
    }

}
$singletonB = new myTestClassB;

add_action('activate_samba/loadbalancer.php', array('myTestClassB',  'install');
?>

There is a request on the Geo plugin for attaching geographic 
coordinates to comments.  I'm not sure exactly where the data would 
originate from, but there isn't anywhere to store it if not in a 
commentmeta table.

This option does not allow $this to be used.  Calling a class method 
statically to call methods on a global instance of an object seems like 
a bad idea.

If you're going to use a static method as the sink for add_action(), 
then you should skip the global instance and call *all* of your 
functions statically:

class myTestClassB() {
	function install() {
		myTestClassB::doSomething();
	}
	function doSomething() {
	}
}
add_action('hook_name', array('myTestClassB', 'install'));

Of course, if you do it that way, you lose all of the benefit of an 
object instance, such as the ability to use $this and class member 
variables.  You may wish you had created an object.

In my experience, it has been better to create an object instance in 
which the constructor adds sinks.

While I'm thinking about it, would it be useful to produce a plugin 
framework class, if not for the core then for general use?

Something like (LIKE this, NOT this):

class pluginFramework {
	function pluginFramework() {
	// Do generic init stuff here?
	}
	function register_sinks() {
		$sinks = array_filter(get_class_methods($this), array(&$this, 
'filterSinks'));
		foreach($sinks as $sink) {
			add_filter($sink, array(&$this, '__'.$sink))
		}
	}
	function filterSinks($name) {
		return(substr($name, 0, 2) == '__');
	}
	function debug() {
	// Generic plugin debug stuff here...
	}
}

And then you could do simple stuff like:

class myPlugin extends pluginFramework {
	funciton myPlugin() {
		$this->register_sinks();
	}
	function __admin_head() {
	// Output stuff in the admin head
	}
	function __admin_footer() {
		$this->debug($_GLOBALS);
	}
}
$myplugin = new myPlugin();

Such a framework could include functions to do more complicated things 
like mess with TinyMCE, handle Ajax requests 
($this->handle_ajax('function_name'); //!!), or respond differently when 
the plugin file is requested directly, and would save me from having to 
package those generic functions into every plugin I produce.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Update Plugin Rewrite Rules
Message-ID: <b3522afe0601140842q6dcfdcddm@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A fotogallery plugin I wrote uses some rewrite rules to define a page
used to show photo albums:
When I created a page with nicename "pics", WP (1.5) added these rules
to .htaccess

RewriteRule ^(pics)/trackback/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&tb=1 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(pics)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(pics)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(pics)/page/?([0-9]{1,})/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&paged=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(pics)(/[0-9]+)?/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&page=$2 [QSA,L]

and I added these to show album and pics (and pagination)

RewriteRule ^pics/([^/]+)/$ /pics/?album=$1 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^pics/([^/]+)/([0-9]+)/$ /pics/?album=$1&pagina=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^pics/([^/]+)/([^/]+)$ /pics/?album=$1&photo=$2 [QSA,L]

These rules worked perfectly with WP 1.5, but in 2.0 they don't work.

How can I update these rules to get them work with new rewrite rules in WP 2.0?

Thanks in advance.

I assume you're adding them directly to the .htaccess file. Don't. Use
$wp_rewrite. http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Rewrite
and the second example on that page should be able to help you.

Is there a reason that execute_all_pings(); is commented out in 
execute-pings.php?

It seems to work better (not perfect but better) when you take the 
comment slashes out.

Still only one pingback goes out per post no matter how many you put in 
the text.

I'll take you up on that when I have some time, probably tomorrow. If
anyone can name that tune in fewer notes, speak up.

Message-ID: <674b4a3b0601141302m4e5b94e0ra85d75979a630204@mail.gmail.com>

Attachments reside in the posts table, just like posts, except they
have status = "attachment".

Say you try to edit an attachment like so, where "3" is the ID of the
attachment in the posts table:
/wp-admin/post.php?action=edit&post=3

In WP 2.0, you get an error because WP tries to include a non-existent
file named "edit-attachment-form.php"

In the latest nightly, you can edit the attachment's description,
although you're not able to change the guid field, which is the link
to the attachment itself (picture or whatever).

So my question is, what are the developers' plans for editing
attachments?  What I'd like to see is a tab named "Attachments"
alongside "Posts" and "Pages" under "Manage", so that you can edit
attachments just like posts and pages.  I'm writing a plugin for 2.0
that will do just that, but I'd like to know if there are plans afoot
to put such a feature in the core.

I can recall at least 2 people in the Support Forums who were using 2.0 and
reported trackback bugs. I am guessing that revision of the ping spawning
mechanism may have been the cause. I was in the forums for under a week, so
this might be a detriment whose scale is rather considerable.

I have just trackbacked 2 blogs using yesterday's nightly. Worked
flawlessly.

Best wishes,

Roy

The strange thing is it works on my home server but not on my host.  
There is obviously some type of incompatibility with certain servers 
that wasn't present in the past versions.

Trackbacks do seem to get sent off if you call execute-pings.php after 
you post.

I'm throwing up my hands for a while.  :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Note for plugin development using js in admin
Message-ID: <43C9A959.805@midnightcircus.com>

The 2.0.1 release seems to be moving all of the core javascript into its 
own files and making the script includes conditional based on what the 
page needs.

That's all fine except it might not be clear where to tell WordPress to 
use the javascript.

Apparently, the hook to use is admin_menu.  Set one of the following 
variables:

add_action('admin_menu', 'admin_menu');
function admin_menu() {
	global $xfn_js, $sack_js, $list_js, $dbx_js;

	$xfn_js = true; // Include the XFN script
	$sack_js = true; // Incluce the tw-sack script
	$list_js = true; // Include the list manipulation script
	$dbx_js = true; // Include the DBX script
}

Note that inserting these script via the admin_header hook seems like a 
bad idea, since two plugins doing this could cause some "interesting" 
collisions.

You might also like to check to see if it's your page that's actually 
loading, so that you're not loading the scripts unnecessarily.  I tried 
this method, and it worked for me:

if(isset($_GET['page']) && ($_GET['page'] == plugin_basename(__FILE__)))
...

Just a note to all plugin devs for 2.0.1, which will likely break your 
existing plugins if you're using the built-in tw-sack for Ajax, since 
it's not included in the admin head by default any more.

Myself, skippy and ringmaster had a conversation a few days back in

0.92 are basically way too old to still be in the WordPress core, so
they should be removed. If they are sorely needed by someone a plugin
can replace them.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2277 has been sitting in trac for a

anyone have any reasons why this shouldn't take place?

You must ensure that you do not break people's links. When it comes to
feeds, people are lazy and careless. They would possible neglect to update
URL's in their feed reader.

By ditching RSS 0.92, for instance, you might lead recently-upgraded blogs
to be ditched by regular readers. It is then left for the Webmaster to set
up redirections, yet many are unfamiliar with the concept.

Visitors may have subscribed to legacy-type feeds in the past; better honour
what was always there, but no longer maintain it. Treat it like an umbilical
cord instead and whatever happens, happens.

Removing old files altogether would have invalidated many requests, for me
at least. Taking the past 2 weeks' feed requests (wp-rss2.php: 5697;
wp-rss2-fulltext.php: 2312; wp-rss.php 2180; feed/rss2/	1717; feed/atom/
1564), an upgrade of WordPress to the latest version would have broken many
requests, especially these from long-time readers. This makes a bad
impression. Leaving deprecated functions in fact is probably harmless. Just
never link to them.

Roy

PS - Gallery, Nuke, and phpBB still use RSS ~0.92 as far as I can tell.

We could redirect both to wp-rss2.php. I'd much rather have two
obsolete redirects hanging around than two obsolete files hanging
around that have to keep being updated every time we make a relevant
API change.

Every client nowadays supports RSS2 and Atom. Redirecting from
RDF/RSS.92 -> RSS2 would be harmless, in all likelihood.

The siteurl option is queried individually on every page load:

     [0] => Array
         (
             [0] => SELECT option_value FROM wp_options WHERE  
option_name = 'siteurl'
             [1] => 0.0012500286102295

It is line 124 in wp-settings.php:

$db_check = $wpdb->get_var("SELECT option_value FROM $wpdb->options  
WHERE option_name = 'siteurl'");

The options cache is up and running at this point... but the wp- 
include files haven't been uploaded... so get_option() is  
unavailable.  Can we move this check to a later point, so that the  
option can be grabbed the the cache with get_option()?  Looks to me  
like an easy way to trim one query from every page load... every  
little bit helps!

Or we could *gasp* provide some documentation explaining the major
differences between this version and the version before it.  A detailed,
human-readable changelog really ought to be provided in each download --
or on the download page.

A changelog entry saying "RDF and RSS 0.92 formats are no longer
supported" ought to be sufficient for a lot of people.

Assuming the writer knows nothing of mod_rewrite, what does he do
then? Inconvience all his readers by telling them all to switch? Not a
great way to increase WP's image. I'm suggesting we add in a couple of
helpful rewrite rules. Of course we'd list major changes like this in
some kind of changelog anyway.

That's not an option that would make WP getting more popular, it's not
a professional tool a compiler or somithing like this. But a piece of
software for people, all people, improvement have to be smooth looking
at standards, but looking at usability and smoothness for basic user
too. Unless we want to make WP a sw for geeks only

When Mark pointed this out, the GeoComments plugin was the first to cross my
mind. A past discussion with Brian Lalor raised the issue of extending the
comments table. The following explained what he had initially implemented.

<quote>
It looks like, in order to store the additional geographical
information about the comment, I will have to create my own table in
the DB.  Is this correct?  Is there any existing mechanism for
storing arbitrary data about a comment?

I'd say that's the first thing I'm struggling with.  Once I'm able to
store the content, enabling a Page or post with this capability will
be simply adding a custom field or checking a box when editing the
post.  I'll probably provide another PHP template that will provide
the comments as an XML file to be consumed by the mapping code.

If that's a real problem, I'd be more inclined to blame it on the API
being too unstable. *Is* it a real problem? The code's better now than
it used to be, and hopefully there'll be less changes needed between
versions now that things are abstracted more. wp-rdf.php (e.g.) was
only changed 8 times in the last year, and not once since September.
It isn't requiring constant attention.

It's hard to say how many people the removal would affect, or how
badly, but it doesn't seem like a big deal to keep the files around.
(I realize I'm not the one maintaining them -- please correct me if
I'm wrong.) I don't think it's worth doing an unknown amount of damage
for no particular reason.

I'm a -0 on this. ;)

For a 2.1 release?  If someone has the stats to say what programs and user 
agents are accessing which major feed types, and that 99% can handle being 
redirected, that's fine.

For a 2.0.1 release.  Bad idea.  I've already seen a few things as either 
suggestions or implementations (at least, I recall) that weren't bugfixes, 
and should be saved for a next feature/point release -- and this joins the 
list.

I'd think it'd probably be best left alone at the moment, assuming the 
maintaining isn't more than maybe an hour or two of tweaking work when WP 
interfaces change (which, note, they really shouldn't...).

Myself, skippy and ringmaster had a conversation a few days back in
#wordpress about feeds. We came to the conclusion that RDF and RSS
0.92 are basically way too old to still be in the WordPress core, so
they should be removed. If they are sorely needed by someone a plugin
can replace them.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2277 has been sitting in trac for a
few days. Skippy, TonySt and ringmaster seconded the proposal, does
anyone have any reasons why this shouldn't take place?

+1

maybe a bunch of these 'globals' should be managed by WP in a 'globals.php' 
file that is autogenerated when options change (rather than on 
request/expire of cache, and rather than a cached lookup have it be 
potentially optimized by the processor)?  just musing... haven't looked at 
the object-cache core to see if it's designed such that it can get 
pre-processing/optimizing by Zend/et al.

Thank you very much. I'll try to use $wp_rewrite instead of editing

I agree - this shouldn't be part of 2.0.1.  We would need to augment our 
support of RSS2 and especially Atom.  I would love to see a full 
bi-directional Atom API implemented for WP.

Is it that it doesn't *require* constant attention, or that it's so 
outdated that nobody cares to pay it any mind?  We've now done a major 
release with WP 2.0, and you're telling me that there was no change to 
rdf over the last three months?  Sounds like neglect to me.

Well, I don't know about that...  Speaking as someone who actually uses 
rdf (a service I use requires it instead of RSS2 for some reason), it 
would bother me if I couldn't tell that the feed wasn't being served 
correctly.

For example, if WP redirects rdf to RSS, then I see no errors on my blog 
server.  But if it 404s on a request for the rdf feed when rdf 
functionality isn't there, then I'm more likely to see it.

Providing plugins that recreate the retired feed types should be 
academic, since we already have the code available.  Retiring the feeds 
would mean less code to maintain, and that's a good thing.

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.64.0601151601310.25254@www.provisio.net>

Hello all,

I'm writing a plugin that has user-specific configuration. Using the
"edit_user_profile" action I can append a form to the bottom of the edit
user page.

However, the code short-circuits the update action, so that my plugin
never has a chance to update its user config. That is,
wp-admin/user-edit.php says:

 	case 'update':

 	$errors = array();

 	if (!current_user_can('edit_users'))
 		$errors['head'] = __('You do not have permission to edit this user.');
 	else
 		$errors = edit_user($user_id);

 	if(count($errors) == 0) {
 		header("Location: user-edit.php?user_id=$user_id&updated=true");
 		exit;
 	}

How am I supposed to update my options? Do we need a new action? i.e.:

 	case 'update':

 	$errors = array();

 	if (!current_user_can('edit_users'))
 		$errors['head'] = __('You do not have permission to edit this user.');
 	else {
 		$errors = edit_user($user_id);
 		do_action('update_user_profile', $errors);
 	}

 	if(count($errors) == 0) {
 		header("Location: user-edit.php?user_id=$user_id&updated=true");
 		exit;
 	}

We need something to serve as a DB sanity check.  What that check is and
how early we execute it are debatable.

Well, we should never say 'if you don't like it, don't upgrade'. We'll
presumably be introducing security patches and big new features in the
future, we don't want this to be a sticking point when the solution is
so easy.

Right, so you'd be one of the people who'd use this plugin. A plugin
fulfilling this role would need to do the following things:

1. Provide code to output the RDF and RSS.92 (easy, just copy-paste
wp-rdf.php and wp-rss.php).
2. Edit $wp_query->feeds to include 'rdf' and 'rss' (as those two
would be removed with the core change).
3. Remove the WP rewrite rules that redirect requests for RDF and RSS 0.92.

That should be, what, half a day's work? I'd do it myself if I had the time.

Nah, just do your update in an earlier hook (say, 'init'), checking for 
the page that they're submitting in $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] and a value 
from your form.

My issue was that I wouldn't know the requests that require rdf were 
failing (since it's not going to generate a 404) unless my service told 
me something was wrong, which they don't.

It's a minor point, I guess.  But I think it's safer to omit redirects 
for the retired feed URLs and let them fail, than to redirect requests 
to RSS2 or Atom that were explicitly for RDF or RSS.

I don't see what real problem you're trying to solve. All I see is the
introduction of new problems for existing users and the people who
read their feeds. They are few but they are more than you four.

Upload a patch that solves the problem you have identified while
preserving the links people depend on and not by simply saying, "you
need a plugin now."

How about:

* RDF and RSS 0.92 are obsolete technologies
* The files only clog up the WordPress download and root folder with
extra, pointless files.
* They have to be maintained when we change the API
* If they're not, they break, and this is bad, because things in the
core should work.

And I don't see why saying 'you need a plugin now' is an unacceptable
solution. Things moving in and out of the core are natural. Some
plugins are merged into the core, some core is moved out to plugins,
as and when different parts of WordPress become more
important/popular. We've done it before: things like Geo URLs were
moved out of the core because noone used them. And it's not like it's
a lot of trouble to install a plugin.

Also, to a side note to everyone who has said and will continue to say
that the API should not change, so they will not need to be
maintained, I beckon you to take a look at the threads that just
popped up on hackers a few days ago about abstracting commenting. Such
a change will require changes to the feeds, and each feed that needs
changing is one more place for new bugs to be introduced.

Yes, things moving out of the core are natural when, as you say,
"noone used them." Earlier replies on this thread indicate that this
case is otherwise.

I'm all for removing old junk, but isn't it customary to label
outdated features "deprecated" for a release or two rather than simply
ripping them out in a bugfix release? Especially when they're still in
use by a not-insigificant number of people.

Yes, let's keep WP current. All I want from you is a solution that
doesn't suddenly alienate people without warning and without need. If
it's as simple as adding a wp_rewrite rule for backwards
compatibility, great. If it means documenting "deprecated"
functionality in one release, then ripping it out unceremoniously in
the alpha stages of a later release, fine.

The argument can easily be made for 0.92, but what makes you say

What about having 0.92/RDF redirected to RSS2, but if that has happened
have the feed add a small post first in the feed, notifying users that
the feed address they have subscribed to is deprecated?

My point is that if a request is made for RDF that doesn't exist and we 
let it 404, that's *good* because it will appear in server logs as a 404 
(with more potential to alert the admin) as opposed to the 200 that a 
redirect to RSS2 would elicit.  And since whatever specifically 
requested RDF likely *needs* RDF, anything but exactly RDF - warning 
post at the top or not - isn't going to parse anyway.

One interesting metric to have would be the number of users/sites that 
*require* RDF to function.

Bloglet, when set to use a feed, only works with WordPress' RDF feed 
even though there is probably some other way I could hook it up.  And 
that's the only thing I know of that must consume RDF and can't consume 
RSS2.

Anyone else have an app that uses RDF exclusively?  Or know how we can 
find out how many people are actually using RDF?

Yahoo-Blogs, Yahoo Slurp, Pluck, and Syndic8 are the only things that
have requested my RDF feed.  Syndic8, at least, is grabbing _all_ of my
feeds.  I haven't checked to see which of the others are doing the same.

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.64.0601152213550.58264@www.provisio.net>

Hi all,

I've updated my "Category Access" (was "Category Limit") plugin for WP2.
The plugin hides categories and posts for categories for which the user
does not have permissions to view.

AFAICT, there are a couple details I can't easily handle right now:

- wp_get_archives doesn't have a hook for me to fix the count. For
   example, if a month has 20 posts, but 4 are inaccessible, I'd like to
   reduce the post count to 16.

- posts_nav_link puts a next page link on a page for which all the posts
   have been hidden. Tracing it a bit, it looks like is_single might be a
   good place to tweak things, but I don't see a hook to do so.

I think I need a couple filters, although I have to confess that it's not
perfectly clear what I really need.

Thanks,
David

Because the choice for feeds is down to RSS2/Atom nowadays. RDF is
old, clunky and really was never intended for feeds, and as a result
it isn't really used at all any more.

As for RSS1, I think you're getting confused. The RSS version you see
when you go to url/feed/rss is RSS 0.92. url/feed/rss2 is RSS2. We've
never had an RSS 1 feed, if indeed such a technology exists.

Nope, not confused. RDF in this case is RSS 1, or rather 1.0.

http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/

Whether or not RDF was intended for syndication needs, it *is* an
XML specification, and the one used for RSS 1.0.

Note that if I went looking I'd no doubt find numerous feeds still
using RSS 0.92, but being superseded by RSS2 such feeds should not
be affected if redirected to WordPress' RSS2 feed. The same cannot
be said for the RDF/RSS 1 feed, hence my questioning your point on
it being an obsolete format.

I'm all for this if it means that feed creation and all it requires 
becomes possible via plugins. I've had to hack my own versions of 
feed-functions-extended.php to support XSPF, SMIL, etc. for too long. 
Not to mention MediaRSS, which I never even started to code...

MediaRSS is doable by adding new elements in one of the filters that 
gets run inside the <item> block, so it's quite possible inside a plugin 
- that's how the Wordpress Structured Blogging plugin does it.

I would think that a compromise could be something like this:

1. Use a library like FeedCreator:

http://www.bitfolge.de/rsscreator-en.html

so that WP is relieved of the maintenance aspect.

2. Continue to generate the proper rewrite rules so that things don't  
break

3. Leave only the RSS 2 and Atom 1.0 feed <link>s in the head of the  
default template

Cheers,

That sounds like an intriguing solution -- again, for 2.1 or something. ;)

Should minimize maintenance of all feed models, allow the old stuff to 
continue to exist going forward (thus, NOT 'ditching' anything), and allow 
for easy expansion to new models/datatypes/etc.

[[
I hear from Uldis and Harry there is talk of dropping RSS 1.0 support
from WordPress. Here's my ?0.02.

The "way too old" argument is empty. "It confuses the users" suggests
that more work is needed on autodiscovery tools, not that the user's
options should be reduced. The "RSS2 and Atom are both competent feed
formats. All feed readers these days are built to understand one or
both of them." argument isn't unreasonable as far as it goes. But it
makes the assumption that what's offered by the different formats is
the same, and should only be considered in the context of current
syndication tools. I think that's a mistake, having the RSS 1.0
available means there is a direct RDF representation of the data.
There is very active RDF development outside the syndication domain
(e.g. this resource list or this), and for WP to cut the direct
interoperability cord would be a retrograde step. Ok, RSS 1.0 may not
be the ideal RDF representation - RSS 1.1 or an RDF/XML serialization
of Atom/OWL would be preferable, primarily because they're both based
on the revised RDF specs which avoid the ugliness of escaped HTML in
content. But RSS 1.0 is supported by virtually every feed reader, and
mass deployment of cleaner RSS RDF/XML isn't likely in the near
future.

I don't really know why the WP folks are even considering removing RSS
1.0, their current source is reasonably well structured, and the
inclusion of the corresponding template for RSS 1.0 is hardly
significant bloat. All they'll really achieve is irritating a segment
of the community.

Speaking personally, I'll echo one of Harry's points:

    As a WordPress user, I like to have options. I want to be able to
choose the format of RSS feeds that I publish. I don't want to be told
what format is the "standard" format and what format is the "right"
format.

For a while now I've had RSS 1.0 as my only feed format, because it
simplifies the kind of experimentation I do.

One point I think that is worth making is that even if they did pull
RSS 1.0 support, it wouldn't be the end of the world for Semantic Web
applications of WordPress. The Atom format is generally sufficient to
provide a good machine-processable representation of the data produced
by WordPress, and deterministic mapping from Atom to RDF is possible
(RSS 2.0 is less suitable because of the spec ambiguities,
non-standard approach to resource (item) identification and broken
content model). For any SemWeb-oriented system that consumes data from
WordPress, the absence of RSS 1.0 isn't a showstopper. However for a
developer working with SemWeb systems, they'll probably be
considerably less likely to choose WordPress if it lacks any RDF
support. To put it another way, I think the SemWeb community is in a
position to say "Go on then, ditch RSS 1.0, see if we care?" ;-)

Ok, so now let's assume that supporting more than one syndication
format is impossible. Which should remain? Here's a quick comparison
of the main alternatives, assigning a value 1, 2 or 3 to various
aspects, with 3 being the best. It is somewhat subjective, but note I
am erring quite strongly in favour of RSS 2.0 by giving
"Human-Legibility" equal weighting with "Not-Brokenness".

Aspect\Format 	RSS 1.0 	RSS 2.0 	Atom
Base Functionality 	2 	1 	3
Not-Brokenness 	2 	1 	3
Extensibility 	3 	1 	2
Adoption 	1 	3 	2
Human-Legibility 	1 	3 	2
Computer-Legibility 	3 	1 	2
Total 	12 	10 	14

Make of that what you will.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Need advice on category link parsing
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.64.0601171031540.97946@www.provisio.net>

Hey all,

I'm trying to make my category order plugin more robust. Right now I hook
list_cats like this:

 	function sort_categories($original_html) {
 		if(strstr($original_html, "<li>")) {
 			$islist = TRUE;
 		} elseif(strstr($original_html,'<br />')) {
 			$islist = FALSE;
 		} else {
 			// Probably an item instead of the whole list
 			return $original_html;
 		}

 		$slug_to_item = category_order::parse_html($original_html,$islist);

 		$new_html = category_order::build_list_html($slug_to_item,$islist);

 		return $new_html;
 	}

AFAICT there is no hook for modifying the category list data structure
prior to WordPress generating the HTML. As a result, I have to dissect the
WordPress HTML, sort the categories, then rebuild the HTML. Ug!

Parsing the HTML is a hassle since the user can specify goofy permalink
structures, so that the category list items look like:

   <li> <a href="http://blog/category/slug/">Cat1</a>

or maybe

   <li> <a href="http://blog/?cat=1">Cat1</a>

Is there an easier way? Or should I get the permalink_structure and try to
do matching on the HTML? If I have to parse the HTML, is there an easy way
to get the category ID from the slug? (Are slugs-to-cat_ids a one-to-one
mapping?)

Thanks,
David

This is another place that needs a plugin hook, but there seems to be 
many places where categories are directly queried.

It looks like categories might even be another candidate for moving into 
API like comments, since many of the places that query categories could 
be using a cache.

+1 as well... And as mentioned, I'd like to see the ability to create 
different feeds, lists, etc. expanded a bit, either through plugins or 
another similar mechanism. I had to do a bunch of silly hacking to get a 
valid Atom 1.0 feed from WordPress.

Yes, and when the ability is there and the plugins easily created for
new feed types and to cover the previous, all but a few feeds should
be removed from the core. +1.

Please read the entire thread containing everyone else's opinions
before you post your own. Allow me to quote myself:

Ignore the first point if you use it. The rest still stand. Our main
problem with RDF and RSS 0.92 isn't that they're bloat, or that
they're 'way too old' (as you pointed out, RDF has an active working
group, although perhaps not in feeds).

This is not what we're saying. We're considering ditching RSS 0.92 and
RDF because not enough people use them. They'd still be around if you
wanted them.

Basically, it boils down to this:

RDF and RSS 0.92 simply aren't what Most People need. If you need
feeds, then Atom or RSS2 provide everything Most People need. Hell,
even the argument about 'a lot of WP users are power users' doesn't
even apply here, the proportion of WP users who give a damn about the
medium between them and their readers is miniscule (if we limit it to
feeds). Most People only care about readers eyeballs on their words.

RDF and RSS 0.92 cause us grief. By keeping them in the core, we're
burdening ourselves with keeping them up to date. Why not give that
job to someone who uses, cares about and understands these
technologies?

Oh and we're not totally ditching the technologies. Of course, a
plugin will be available for those who still want RDF/RSS 0.92.

I think that the best solution is the one that Alex King suggested in  
the other thread:

> Use a library like FeedCreator

 From what I understand from looking at the library, this would allow  
us to have ONE feed-generating WordPress script.  We could then tell  
FeedCreator to "make it RSS 2.0," or "make is Atom 0.3"

That removes the maintenance aspect of RSS 0.92 and RDF support... or  
at least would substantially reduce it.  Heck, it would also make it  
easier for maintaining RSS 2.0 and Atom 0.3 (or 1.0, eventually) feeds.

I have read the thread. It is riddled with inaccuracies and poorly
informed. But I chose not to highlight these errors, rather to provide
a valid, balanced argument on why I thought the proposal to ditch RSS
1.0 was ill-conceived.

RSS 0.92 has long been deprecated in favour of RSS 2.0, I see no
reason for not ditching that. However RDF is a very active technology,
as anyone with the ability to use a search engine can determine.

The rest still stand. Our main
> problem with RDF and RSS 0.92 isn't that they're bloat,

Which appears to be your second point above. Because of the dev work
I've been doing, I have been using solely the RSS 1.0 recently, in
particular with the FOAF Output plugin. It's far from pointless for
me.

"ditching" = "still around" ?

As I point out in my post, strictly speaking Atom alone would be
adequate for most people, though reducing support to this wouldn't
necessarily be desirable.

Hell,

True. The majority of people probably only care about a small subset
of the functionality offered by WordPress. But have you heard of the
long tail? If you add up the number of people that *do* care about all
the fringe features, you probably have a significant proportion of the
users.

> RDF and RSS 0.92 cause us grief. By keeping them in the core, we're

I fail to see how RSS 1.0 support causes significant extra grief,
virtually all the fields map directly to those found in the other
formats.

Why not give that
> job to someone who uses, cares about and understands these
> technologies?

I would have hoped that the developers of one of the leading blogging
tools would have enough understanding of syndication technologies to
realise RSS 1.0 is qualitatively different than RSS 2.0, Atom or for
that matter RSS 0.92. Or at least care enough to do some basic
research before suggesting the removal of a feature.

> Oh and we're not totally ditching the technologies. Of course, a
> plugin will be available for those who still want RDF/RSS 0.92.

Yes, and other weblog tools are available too. I'm afraid the blatant
lack of research on the subject prior to proposing the removal of a
feature doesn't inspire much confidence in me as a WordPress user. Are
all decisions made from such an uninformed perspective? Again, I
believe Atom alone could provide usable data for the vast majority of
clients. But I see no compelling argument for the arbitrary removal of
RSS 1.0 support.

Cheers,
Danny.

Heaven forbid we engage in conversation to discuss the relative 
strengths and weaknesses of user-submitted proposals.

On #wordpress, I submitted the suggestion that RDF and RSS 0.92 should 
be ditched.  Mine was a _completely_ uninformed comment, because I don't 
track syndication technologies too closely.  I fervently wish that 
WordPress 2.0 would have shipped with Atom 1.0 support.  I _really_ want 
to see Atom-enabled commenting.  David opened the ticket, and posted the 
link in the channel.  I promptly donned my AOL hat and hit METOO!!!111

Contrast this entire discussion with Matt's one-sided decision to 
implement the feed: prefix to feed URIs somewhere in the 1.5 release. 
That instantly broke links for a majority of users.  It generated dozens 
of threads in the support forums.  There was _zero_ discussion about it, 
and the bug opened about it was promptly closed with "wontfix" at the time.

We're not making decisions, we're discussion one suggestion.

 From what you've put forward, I still don't see a compelling argument 
to keep RDF.  Sure, some people use it.  You haven't yet proven that 
_many_ people use it.

If a plugin were made available to provide RDF support, all the RDF 
users would be happy.  This wouldn't be the first time a plugin was 
required to work around shortcomings of core deficiencies.  We're 
_still_ required to use a no-nofollow plugin, even though nofollow has 
been wildly unsuccessful in stopping comment spam...

Nor have you taken up the responsibility for maintaining it.  Surely 
someone who knows as much as you about it and cares so deeply for it 
would jump at the chance to improve the robustness of this part of 
WordPress.

If we used either of the suggested methods - the library suggested by 
Alex King, or replacement with a plugin - the functionality you describe 
would become more flexible as people who care about it took on 
responsibility for it.

Right now, it's an albatross - poorly maintained and wouldn't be missed 
by most.  If we perform some of the other revisions that had been 
suggested for future wordpress versions, it would *require* revision, 
and the track record for revisions on that module seems poor enough due 
to apparent lack of interest that it's a shame to leave something in 
that is as low-functional as it is.

Nobody has suggested preventing RSS 1.0 from running from WordPress, 
just it's removal from the core as something that the community is 
forced to support.

That turns out not to be the case. If there's a plugin to produce RSS 
1.0, then the "provide the data, and the uses will come" part of the 
population of SemWeb fans will be happy, but since the people actually 
building the things to use the data will suddenly have vastly less data 
to work with, they'll be decidedly unhappy.

Best be leaving those feeds alone... *grin*

In all seriousness, though, I'd be all for plugin-izing the feeds, as 
long as the plugin were included ala Hello Dolly.

Oooh, is that all it takes to make this comedy of a thread go away, 
bunging a name into the wiki page o' responsibility? I don't know as 
much about it as Danny, but then that leaves me less busy, too: given 
sufficient assurance that this will go away, and the "rip out RSS 1.0 
support, because someone writing a SemWeb consumer can just publish his 
own feed with a plugin, and he won't care whether or not he can get 
other people's feeds as RDF" bug will be wontfixed, I'd be more than 
happy to claim responsibility for feeds. A couple dozen lines of PHP and 
XML/RDF? I think even I can handle that.

But neither is there evidence to the contrary. The owner of a blog is 
not the primary consumer of RSS data. So asking a WordPress user "do you 
use your RDF feed" is useless. And as Phil Ringnalda pointed out, simply 
dropping support for it in favor of a plugin would remove a large pool 
of blog data from the net. Yes, the data would still be available in 
other forms, but the RDF blog format is used heavily by a rather strong 
subset of technically inclined folks.

I don't think that dropping RSS 0.92 in favor of RSS 2.0 would cause 
much of a ripple, but the RDF format is sufficiently different from RSS 
2.0 and Atom, and sufficiently useful to justify keeping it, IMHO. The 
RDF data model is very useful. It's easy to get put off by it, because 
the XML serialization of RDF isn't very pretty. But RSS 1.0 provides a 
flexible data framework for which there is already a fairly large 
toolset available to consume and manipulate the data relations.

Including the plugin negates the stated purpose of relieving WP of the
code's maintenance. If somebody finds a bug in Hello Dolly, guess who
fixes it?

There are literally dozens, probably hundreds of formats that some
group of people would like to have available for purposes of data
mining and app construction and who knows what. Should they all be
enabled out of the box or should it be up to a site owner to make a
choice about what data they are publishing? Essentially you are saying
here, if I read you correctly, that removing RDF is a problem because
a lot of people don't realize that they are even publishing such a
feed and so wouldn't do so if it were optional.

What about leaving it an option but having RDF and a few well-chosen
other plugins as part of the Wordpress Core using a good library so
that maintenance is essentially nil?

While having choices is all good and well, things need to be
deprecated over time, if we're moving toward a semantic web, the
sooner the new replaces the old, the better. If I had to pick any one
feed to remove, it would the current Atom feed to be replaced with
Atom 1.0. When I asked why we wouldn't have Atom 1.0 in WordPress 2.0,
this was vaguely my response:

"Not enough readers support it."
"If we never include it, why would any readers be prompted to support
it? Why can't we just give it another filename, like we did for RSS2?"
"Because we didn't name wp-atom.php wp-atom0.3.php at first."

I can see the arguements about RDF being left in, and if someone will
step up to support them, then fine, we can keep them around. But old
versions and old versions of RSS really don't need to be left in for
the future. If we were to remove them as soon as we've moved trunk to
2.whatever/3.0 development, that gives everyone the proper amount of
warning, plugins will popup nearly immediately, and by the time the
new release is out, people will be expecting the loss.

Keeping 4 feed formats around and hopefully adding one more for a
total of five feeds for the next version is just unnecessary
unmaintained bloat. RSS, RDF, and Atom, 3 formats, in their latest
version, is all that we really need.

Good of you Phil. Add my name to the list - I've not done very much
PHP, but I do know how to run feeds against the validator ;-)

The same stands true for all other syndication formats - be it Atom or RSS2.

Majority of users (blog authors) do not even realise that their blog
is producing any machine readable feed. So - their blog tool is
generating something that they do not know or care about - which they
would not enable if it was an option - simply because they are not
aware if it.

Following your thought then we should make _all_ formats (RSS1, RSS2,
Atom) be an option that the user will switch on if he/she wishes to do
so. What will be the result? Probably 10 to 20-fold decrease in the
number of feeds and data available.

Speaking of RSS 1.0 (alias RDF Site Summary 1.0) - it is an a data
representation format based on RDF that is significantly different
from plain XML-based formats like RSS2 and Atom. It is a development
independent of RSS 0.92->RSS 2.0 branch and so is not made obsolete by
RSS 2.0.

It allows to enhance the information in a way that is not possible in
pure XML-based formats (RDF is more than XML). Just redirecting
requests for RSS 1.0 to a RSS 2.0 will just create problems as RSS 2.0
_sure_ is not valid RDF.

There are people using it and there is no substitute format that would
be useable to consumers of RDF if you drop RSS 1.0 (contrary to RSS
0.92 for which RSS2 is a natural choice). So - people are using it
[again - main users of feeds are aggregators and not authors of blog
entried], it works, why break it?

Having said that - using a single library to produce _all_ feeds like
it was proposed previously might be the way to go. But until then
don't break what works.

Besides, some of you are only thinking of feeds in terms of sources
for feed-readers. Look in the future - and do you see feed-readers as
only consumers of feed metadata? There are also sites that aggregate
feeds, desktop tools like PiggyBank [1] that can exploit richer data.
There are possibly more uses that have not thought about yet. And RDF
/ RSS 1.0 is the richest representation of blog metadata - regardless
if you know that or not.

Point taken.

Here's a thought: why not create a new rewrite rule that feeds all 
requests for the old RDF/RSS feeds to an error-handling page that then 
serves up well-formatted RSS 0.92/RDF error messages saying something 
like "This blog has moved to new core software and is no longer 
supporting this feed format.  Please see http://sitename/feed/rss2 for 
the latest and best incarnation of the feed" or somesuch.

There is a slight difference between adding "dozens, probably hundreds
of formats" and to removing one that is currently live.

Essentially you are saying

It hadn't clicked with me until Phil mentioned it, but that sounds
about right. It isn't the publishers that are (potentially) impacted
in the first instance, but the consumers.

I've yet to dig into the source very far, but if the support for
publishing formats can be modularised as plugins it sounds like it
would be beneficial all around (there's probably some nice
functionality that could be added down that path too). But I still
suspect it would be unwise to switch of any of the big 3 formats at
this point in time.

Out of curiosity, a little side question - can anyone give
estimate/guess of the proportion of WordPress install environments
which will (already) support XSLT?

Cheers,
Danny.

I believe that would be inconsistent with what's generally considered
good practice on the web - the error messages do not represent the
same resources as the feeds. I'm not 100% sure offhand, but I think
HTTP 410 Gone might well be the most appropriate response in such a
situation.

"latest", "best"..."rss2"?!

So there's a vocal body of RDF supporters.  I admit fully that I am
ignorant of machine-readable formats, and their many uses.  I further
admit that I only think of these formats in the context of feed reading.

History suggests that WordPress will progress in whichever way that Matt
or Ryan deem best, so perhaps Phil's right when he disparages this
thread as comedy.

So, please educate me: what applications are consuming RDF?  I might
find something terribly important that I hadn't realized was RDF under
the hood, and become a convert.  How large is the population served by
the tools being produced by the subset of technically inclined folks?

You're making the assumption that a fundamental goal of WordPress is to
provide this machine-readable information to the subset of technically
inclined folks mentioned above.  There's already a rather large row
brewing between the folks who want WordPress to remain _just_ a blog and
those who want WordPress to develop further down the CMS path.

I wonder what portion of the users of WordPress would care about the
subset of technically inclined folks making tools with RDF.  But again,
I'm ignorant of their tools, and eagerly await education.

I can give you much more than an estimate. the answer is very few.

I had a few xml/xslt based plugins at one point, and it proved to be an
extremely lousy choice.

"Help! Help! My site is broken! I don't understand! What should I do? Why
can't you help me? What should I tell my host?"

Even doing as little as sending a pointer to a faq was too time consuming.
And after I bumped into further limitations related to xslt, which is far
less sexy than it looks in practice, I eventually discarded the thing
entirely.

For the record, I discarded xml handling via php's xml-specific stuff as
well at about the same time: After some testing, it became all too clear
that using preg_match_all was a much better option when it came to
performance. And as a bonus, users were no longer requesting support because
of misconfigured shared servers.

In short: XML/XSLT is slower to code, slower to implement, slower to run,
and requires more support. Don't get me wrong, though. It's a positive ROI
-- for CPU vendors and IT firms.

I consider feeds to be a fundamental part of blogging. Machine-readable
is a superset of that, but feeds _are_ important, even for _just_ a blog.

Lest I be mis-understood, I consider _feeds_ to be a fundamental part of
blogging, too.  I can't imagine life without my aggregator.  I'm not
advocating the wholesale removal of feeds from WordPress.

True... I am just trying to get at the need to have some kind of clear
criteria for selection if choices like this are to be made in a
reasonable way. Otherwise it's just I want, I don't want. Of course,
if it DOES all come down to what Matt/Ryan want irregardless of
discussion here (I'm too new to the community to comment on that),
then it's all academic.

I do think that the discussion needs to go beyond aggregators and
human-initiated and controlled feed access, as I think you and Phil
are both trying to take it :)

Also useful links:  I'm using FeedCreator to produce OPML, RSS2 and
XBEL feeds of my WordPress links.  The XBEL feed is great for syncing
all the links to the Bookmarks menu of Firefox.

Looks like they're running with safe_mode on.  2.0.1 disables the
persistent cache if safe_mode is on.

This is a dumb question: how many hosts have safe mode on?  I would have 
expected my plugins to fail left and right (given they too create cache 
files...).

And, this would obviously also nuke things like WP-Cache, right?

Eeek.

Yes, it can be painful unless there is some workaround that I don't know
about.  Given the griping on php.net and elsewhere, I don't think there
is a workaround.

Some hosts are asking whether they should turn safe_mode off.  They want
to know if it buys any real added security or if it just breaks things.

If you're ever asked this personally, or you feel like telling
someone, safe_mode just complicates things. If you want added
security, turn open_basedir on, and use the disabled_functions
directive in php.ini to disable all of the exec related functions so
that users can't run binaries, and you've pretty much locked down
tigher than safe_mode does.

safe_mode is scheduled for complete removal from PHP6.

Haha... okay. And I'm sure I'm being dense here. Bear with me.

I need to apply a rel attribute to links on the images.  I notice the images get a class="imagelink" attribute so it should be possible to isolate just images in "the_content" ;).

However, without roughing in some js, I am drawing a blank on how to munge those links...

Is that specific enough? :)

Changing HTML tag attributes is almost always easier in JS and this is
no exception.

Actually... I had the bright idea of using you?re the_content suggestion and doing a str_replace on class="imagelink".  It's the simple things. :)

I decided to post also here...

I have created a patch that adds SQLite support and it can be found
here: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2317 

It basically just uses regex to translate mysql queris to something that
SQLite understands too. I just don't have any extra time to develop this
any further so I post it here in hope of that someone might get it
finished. All major features should work but there are plenty of room
from improvement.

I have run wp2 w/ SQLite succesfully for couple of weeks now in my own

Subject: [wp-hackers] Breaking down the Edit_Pages capability
Message-ID: <39b665d2b5dfd4c822f7ccc0b361f158@placenamehere.com>


While looking over the wp 2.0 roles and capabilities list I was struck 
that one of the first user type I'd setup couldn't be done because I'd 
want to have a user that could edit pages as a content admin, but not 
have the facility to effect the overall site structure by adding new 
pages. The posts capabilities are granular enough, but the Edit_pages 
capability seems to wrap up both the ability to write new pages *and* 
edit existing ones into the one flag.

Is there any particular reason for this setup or is it simply an 
oversight that comes with the first implementation of roles? Is there a 
discussion somewhere out there on the setup of the roles, why they were 
picked as they were (list archives)? I saw at least one bug in track to 
tweak capabilities (dealing with page ownership), is that the best 
starting point for trying to get the edit pages split more?

Changes to WP core code aside, for those who know the roles system 
well, what direction would be cleanest to take in the short term to 
make this split on my own installs? Is it going to take creating a new 
capability and then combing the code for where the old one was checked 
and flipping a bunch of user checks on a few different pages, or is 
there a cleaner direction? Can plugins reach this deep or only hacking?

Ultimately, I'd love to be able to lock down most everything besides 
the 'body' content (delete page, page slug, page title, etc) but 
realistically simply blocking the Write Page UI while allowing access 
to Manage Pages along with a little cautionary comment made to my 
client would be enough.

(And yes, I've seen the current roles plugin, but what I'm looking to 
do is first split the capability)

One thing to consider is that we do not have "draft pages" at this
time. The "draft" status makes it possible for Contributors to write
posts but not publish them or edit existing pages. Without the ability
to hold back a new page for moderation by an Editor, there is little
reason to split the capabilities for pages as you suggest.

In my particular case I don't want a copy editor to draft new pages 
either -- the draft case doesn't have anything to do with my approach 
here (although it may be another hole in the current capabilities set). 
I simply want to (as an admin) lock down the site structure to the blog 
+ 3 or 4 pages that can easily be edited, and then create a user that 
is in charge of managing the content in all those spots. Write+manage 
access for posts, but only manage access for pages.

If there are new pages to be created that would be the call and 
responsibility of someone higher up the food chain.

Now I see what you're after. It wouldn't be too hard to use an
existing hook to check the current user's role when publishing a new
page and deny access to any given role.

Off the top of my head and without regard for aesthetics or usability,
this might do in a pinch:

function kill_new_page($status) {
 if ( in_array('administrator', $GLOBALS['current_user']->roles) ||
'static' != $status )
  return $status;

 $page = &get_page($_POST['post_ID']);
 if ( isset($page->ID) )
  return $status;

 die('You do not have permission to publish pages.');
}
add_filter('status_save_pre', 'kill_new_page');

Removing the unwanted submenu item for non-admins is another trick.

Removing the Create New Page link from edit-pages.php without hacking
the core would require buffer manipulation. Start the buffer at
'admin_menu' and handle it at admin_footer.

Cheers,
Andy

Hi everybody,

This is NoWhereMan from FlatPress project. We've been working on a flat file 
based blogging engine. Our purpose was migrating from SimplePHPBlog to a 
more solid and extensible environment. We ended with code it on our own.

Home: http://flatpress.sourceforge.net/home/

Well, what has this to do with Wordpress? Well, I thought that one of the 
most known and used and extensible blogging platforms was Wordpress... so I 
started with reading something about its plugin api, and I decided it was 
nice to have it embedded into our codebase... (of course it will be GPL'd 
;) )

So, that's it. :)
I'll soon release something (on cvs) as soon as I understand this cvs stuff, 
I'm new at it :P


Kind Regards,

Hi Shane,

Quite frankly, I am confused. what is is that you believe is missing from
Link Category Management? Will it be valuable to all users and to what
extent will it add clutter and lead to bafflement? Are you attempting
hierarchical link categories, much like post categories? Easier 'batch
mode' alternation of categories? Import/export? I believe some basic
(existing) functionality has evaded your attention, so better explore
before extending.

Best wishes,

Roy

Looks I've finally sorted it out...
You can download from cvs as usual with

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/flatpress login

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/flatpress co -P 
flatpress

of course I must say the version I've uploaded is not anymore the one I'm 
working on; I'm working now on a "pluggable" control panel, which has not 
been committed yet, as it is still completely broken (catastrophic crash 
:( ).

Anyway I'd be glad if someone would like to have a look at the code, that, 
while still messy and needing a LOT of polishing (and this is why we didn't 
release anything), I think has got some nice ideas :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] how to create separate search function?
Message-ID: <200601221240.k0MCeOkN021344@post.webmailer.de>

Hi,

I need to write a search plugin or hack  that's completely separate from the
existing search functionality of Wordpress (I think).
Basically I would like to use the existing search function as it is, but
have a second search function to search for matches after users have filled
out a brief questionnaire (this is a product based blog, so the users will
enter specific features of the product they would like and the search will
then only show them results matching their selections). I'm going to store
these features in custom fields.

So far I have found a few plugins, that search custom fields, but the
problem is that they EXTEND the existing search function. 

What I'm wondering now is how to write a separate search plug in or create a
hack (should I reuse some of the existing search functionality, etc) and
more importantly how to INTEGRATE such a plugin/hack, as I don't think there
will be an existing hook I can call such a plugin through?

Thank you for your input.

Steve

(ADMIN) without being worry about miss-usages/hacks/attacks, After working a
bit I found a simple way , I will explain my way. Before I announce this
soloution and putting it into action , I need some experts' comments.

First of All I changed wp-includes/wp-db.php (function query) :

Original Code:

$this->result = @mysql_query($query, $this->dbh);
++$this->num_queries;

Changed to :

global $userdata;

if (($userdata->user_login == 'demo') &&
(preg_match("/^\\s*(insert|delete|update|replace) /i",$query)))
    $_stop = true;
else
    $_stop = false;

if (!$_stop) {
    $this->result = @mysql_query($query, $this->dbh);
    ++$this->num_queries;
}

This code will prevent user identified by DEMO to change database, After
that we should turn the wp cache off to avoid option caching,

This method would work, and will show the demo user all the power of WP
ADMIN area without changing the DB at all :)

There's just one point remains : editing files

This can be overcome by using "WP2 Roles", I used plugin "Role Manager" and
revoked "Edit Plugins", "Edit Files", "Import" and "Edit Themes" from a Role
named "Demo" and assigned the user demo the role demo!

This seems to work, I tested it localy and there were no problem, is there
anything that I forgot? any idea? can I put this method into action?

Includes a plugin for 2.0 and a potential patch on 2.0 to add a new 
capability "edit_others_pages" that might interest you.  Specifically, 
if you do not have this capability, then you can't edit the pages of others.

It might not be exactly the solution, but I would be interested in 
seeing any alterations that allowed users with "edit_others_pages" to 
edit existing pages without allowing them to create new ones themselves.


Also, you can easily remove menus from the admin without buffering by 
hooking admin_menu, using $menu/$submenu as a global, checking for the 
conditions of display, then unset() the appropriate core menu item.

add_action('admin_menu', 'my_admin_menu');
function my_admin_menu() {
	global $submenu;
	if(!current_user_can('some_new_capability')) {
		unset($submenu['post.php'][10]);
	}
}


And finally, a rule of thumb:  NEVER check anything against a role name. 
  ALWAYS use a capability.  Why?  Capability names are not translated 
(__('Administrator') != 'Administrator'), and are not designed to be 
potentially deleted.

Create a new page template that implements your specialized search based 
on receiving values as $_POST or $_GET values as required.

Create a page that uses that template.

Create a form that sends the search query to the page you've created.

Avoid using fields in your form that WordPress uses to display posts, 
like "name" or "page"

Sorry, this email went out before I meant to send it out.  I apologize
for the confusion.  The feature I'm talking about, is hierarchical
link category management.  I don't think it will add confusion or
bafflement to the product.  I think peope will really like it..  I'm
currently about 90% done with the changes.  Sorry for the earlier
confusion.

I saw that and think I mentioned it in my initial post.

I guess what I'm getting at is does someone (I?) need to file another 
bug to get these other options (say a create_pages along side of 
edit_pages and the coming edit_others_pages) rest of that post 
granularity mirrored in the pages capabilities set or is there some 
valid reason that road hasn't been taken.

Aye, thanks all for the code snippets so far - and keep em coming if 
you have any other ideas. Some time this week I'll get my hands dirty 
and really look at the cleanest way to get where I want in the short 
term.

My blog (hitormiss.org) has gone from using around 60 queries (taking

seconds to generate the page). I used a debug statement in wp-db.php to

Subject: [wp-hackers] Need more hooks (?)
Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.64.0601231242080.35419@www.provisio.net>

This relates to my "category access" plugin, which restricts posts in
certain categories from certain users.
(http://www.coppit.org/blog/archives/91)

My request is for there to be a call to the list_cats_exclusions filter
from within get_next_post and get_previous_post, similar to the way it's
already done in list_cats.

This way plugin authors can hook list_cats_exclusions and modify the
accessible posts in both the category list and the navigational post
links.

-----------------

In the meantime, is there any way I can intercept next_post_link from the
theme, and modify the category exclusions? Do I have to use some sort of
PHP trick?

Or should I tell users to modify their theme to call
category_access::next_post_link?

Thanks,
David

P.S. Is this the right place for hook requests?

Message-ID: <008701c6205c$6f020040$7f01a8c0@DaveVaio>

Hi List,

I'm undertaking a project involving the integration of AMFPHP and Wordpress.
I'd like to use Wordpress' functionality, but to handle parts of the front
end from everyone's favourite plugin, Flash.

AMFPHP expects a bunch of classes on the server-side to be invoked by remote
calls from a client-side movie. However, I'm stumbling to understand how the
code in Wordpress hangs together... I'm attempting a reasonably simple
thing, a login. I'm trying to write a script to simply validate a
user/password combination against the uselist in the WP database. Ideally,
I'd like to handle this with a minimum of custom code and maximum use of
existing WP functions and classes... however, I'm struggling to get my head
into how everything fits together on the WP side, and even to find the right
documentation, which is ... sparse... at best, even in the codex. 

Beyond ripping the existing Wordpress php pages apart, which would give me a
less future-proof route, is there any documentation or pointers out there
that can help me figure out clean, abstracted ways of handling this? Or am I
going to have to get dirty? And has anyone out there already done anything
like this, and have any pointers I can use? 

Cheers guys,

Dave

I, believe, that is a matter of simply including the wp-config. After 
including that, you'll be set to make use of all the wp functions in 
order to abstract the validation of usernames.

You may want to be weary of what those validation functions do in regard 
to making cookies, but I don't imagine that to be too much of an issue.

This gives you access to the WP functions etc:

<?php

define('WP_USE_THEMES', false);
require('wp-blog-header.php');


// your code here

?>

In 2.0, you can include wp-config.php and then call wp().  Templates
won't be loaded unless you explicitly include template-loader.php.

It doesn't cache options that don't exist, for one... but that would  
be fixed by turning all plugins off:

Perhaps Ryan can comment on what an improperly configured server with

 A broken safe_mode will do it.  is_writable() returns true, indicating
that we can cache to the disk.  However, when it's time to actually put
a file in the cache dirs, we fail due to safe_mode and return false when
trying to retrieve from the cache.  We then query the DB and try to set
the cache, which fails due to safe_mode.  This happens every time we try
to read from the cache and results in lots of queries.

So, those affected by this should DISABLE_CACHE.

Okay, just trying to be clear since there's no Codex info on this. Correct 
me if I'm wrong on anything below.

So the quick-fix is:

  define('DISABLE_CACHE', true);

The longer term solution is either an upgrade to newer WP (2.01 release, or 
sounds like latest head has it?), which will better detect and disable 
things (BTW, Ryan, would be nice if the dashboard had in red letters "Your 
hosting setup doesn't support caching to disk!" -- no joke, if there is a 
hosting 'config' that is really bad for WP, we should make the user 
aware...), or to get the host to fix things or move to another provider or 
???   I presume there is NOT any sort of tweak in htaccess or other 
user-accesible file that'll help this?

Yep.  WP 2.0 needs DISABLE_CACHE, WP 2.0.1 (currently) does it  
automatically (can be overridden with ENABLE_CACHE for people who  
know their safe mode is functional).

It might be nice to throw up errors for other common problems such  
as /wp-content/ not being writable.

+1 (as long as...)

Make sure the errors have links to the wiki or something that contains 
solutions to the errors -- don't leave them hanging with a big red error 
and no idea what to do about "caching" or "chmod".

I don't know if I'd want this in my face in the Dashboard all the time. 
It should be *somewhere*, but out of the way. After all, what's the 
point of constantly seeing a warning about safe_mode, if there's no way 
for you to get your host to change it? But it would certainly be useful 
to have some sort of friendly explanations during the install/upgrade 
process.

This is probably a WP2.1 kind of thing.

How about during the Upgrade the code checked whatever it needs.
It then gives info before the 'Have fun!' link but makes it clear that
the blog is usable.
If that could then set a flag to display an 'Attention' or 'Error' tab
in the admin somewhere with explanations and links for each ?

That sounds good.  And on that errors page, there could be a "Hide  
this tab" button that'd dismiss it until the next upgrade, or  
something, for people who are annoyed by it.

Yeah, having this information somewhere would be nice. It should be  
unobtrusive for those who have already seen (and ignored for one  
reason or another) it... I like Podz's idea about including it in the  
setup process, but I think there should also be a display in the  
actual dashboard that shows you this information, so you can see when  
things may change (like my wp-content no longer being writable after  
I moved servers... arggghhh!).

Subject: [wp-hackers] missing custom fields
Message-ID: <200601242104.k0OL3xaM001303@post.webmailer.de>

Hi,
I have a lot of custom fields (25 or so) in Wordpress 1.5. The problem is
that for some reason only 10 are selectable from the drop down menu 'Add a
new custom field to this post'.
Does anyone know where to change the number of selectable custom fields in
the code (assuming that it's just a problem of not allowing more than 10
fields as a standard setting)?

Thanks.

Steve

I think Podz's idea is great and you addendum it is too. Maybe we can
disucss it with Matt on the IRC Meetup of tomorrow evening

Might be a good place for a hook... $num = apply_filters 
('dropdown_key_number', '10'); and then use $num in the query.  Gives  
us the flexibility to change it, without cluttering the options table  
for everyone.

Hook is a good idea, but I don't think something like this  
(configuration for a built-in feature) should be plugin-dependent.  
Seems there should certainly be an option for this (which doesn't  
preclude the possibility of a hook for it as well for maximum  
flexibility).

That's risking hosts getting angry customers feedback like "they say
they support WP but WP says the host is not OK!", so the message
should make it clear that it's something the user could fix by
herself.

It might be even nicer to take this idea further and define "server
capabilities" flags, that could be used for dependency checking in
plugins.

After all, maybe I don't want to have wp-content writable.
But if I activate a plugin that needs it, it would be better if it got
deactivated right away with a message telling me that it needs to be
able to write to wp-content.
All too often the reality is different: plugin tries to write, fails
and spews an error, WP's output buffering makes the page blank, user
is confused. By enabling plugins to prevent such failures, WP would
become more solid to both plugin developers and users.

Big red letters may be a bit much... I dislike software that inspires  
panic with things like that which may or may not be a real issue.  
Still, I think it should be mentioned somewhere. The "Alerts" (or  
similar) tab on the Dashboard would keep it out of the way for people  
who are aware there's a problem, yet still allow you to see what's  
going on.

You could then include the ability to acknowledge or simply close an  
alert (anyone used Veritas Backup Exec? I'm thinking along the lines  
of their alerts here). After you acknowledge a respective error, it  
never shows back up again, or simply suppresses any visible  
notification and is confined to the special panel that displays that  
information exclusively. That way, we could tell people there may be  
something wrong on the Dashboard and point their attention to the  
Alerts area so they could investigate before their entire site blows  
up because their wp-content folder wasn't properly permissioned after  
a server migration (grrrrr again).

We would certainly want some method for dismissing errors, because  
there are a lot of situations in which this would come up -- if your  
host runs in safe mode and there's no way for you to change it, you  
don't want to get slapped with a big red error message every time you  
load a page.

I like this idea, because you're right. A lot of plugin / theme  
authors (myself included) don't do enough error checking -- it works  
on all the setups they've tested just fine, but then again they don't  
have PHP running in safe mode anywhere, so it barfs on some random  
user somewhere and no one knows why. If the plugin could just list a  
few requirements (we'd have to dumb them down, since I imagine a lot  
of people wouldn't know what safe mode allows or prohibits -- myself  
included again) and have WP check against them automagically when the  
plugin is activated, it'd be great.

So, did a certain someone just volunteer to write this code for us? :)

But in the vast majority of hosting situations (as most people are  
using shared hosting), this (safe mode) is NOT something that the  
user can fix on their own.

I quite like the way Drupal does this. It's been a while since I used 
it, but IIRC: in the admin screen, there's an error log, with the 
severity of the error clearly indicated (notices in white, warnings with 
a yellow triangle and errors with a red X). A description of the error 
and the time it occurred is given, and the user can filter or clear the 
list as they wish.

So long as the descriptions gave enough information for tech-savvy users 
to fix things themselves, and directed less-tech savvy users to places 
where they could find help, it'd be great.

If it is a host-config issue, it should be noted as such.  Given the 'need' 
for caching for optimizing performance of both core and plugins, things like 
this should be flags that the host has a 'bad configuration' of sorts.

Most importantly, if plugins AND wp-core are making assumptions, for good 
reason, that wp-content should (and IMHO must) be writeable, that error 
should be left prominent (again, unless specifically 'dismissed' as others 
have proposed), as it'll affect things in major ways on that system.

Further, given the level of 'crap' in the dashboard (again, IMHO), this is 
something that ISN'T crap.  It should be at the same level as a notification 
of pending security patches or major updates (that is, generally visible 
unless 'turned off' somehow).

(Once more: IMHO! ;) :) )

Granted, that'd be nice longer-term, but a simple messaging system could 
make it into a build in the near-term.  Very near term -- this isn't 
complex, and the cases to be 'detected' are already being detected.

Also, the onus should be on the plugin >system< to provide standard 
information to plugins, like 'this host cannot write to files', or 'this 
host can write to wp-content' -- well, a standard base set of 
queries/features.

Thanks for the quick response. Hook or not, I don't really see why it should
be limited at all. If I create custom fields I want to be able to use them.
No use limiting the drop selection of them.

Hi,
I have a lot of custom fields (25 or so) in Wordpress 1.5. The problem is
that for some reason only 10 are selectable from the drop down menu 'Add a
new custom field to this post'.
Does anyone know where to change the number of selectable custom fields in
the code (assuming that it's just a problem of not allowing more than 10
fields as a standard setting)?

Thanks.

Steve

I think Podz's idea is great and you addendum it is too. Maybe we can
disucss it with Matt on the IRC Meetup of tomorrow evening

Might be a good place for a hook... $num = apply_filters 
('dropdown_key_number', '10'); and then use $num in the query.  Gives  
us the flexibility to change it, without cluttering the options table  
for everyone.

Hook is a good idea, but I don't think something like this  
(configuration for a built-in feature) should be plugin-dependent.  
Seems there should certainly be an option for this (which doesn't  
preclude the possibility of a hook for it as well for maximum  
flexibility).

That's risking hosts getting angry customers feedback like "they say
they support WP but WP says the host is not OK!", so the message
should make it clear that it's something the user could fix by
herself.

It might be even nicer to take this idea further and define "server
capabilities" flags, that could be used for dependency checking in
plugins.

After all, maybe I don't want to have wp-content writable.
But if I activate a plugin that needs it, it would be better if it got
deactivated right away with a message telling me that it needs to be
able to write to wp-content.
All too often the reality is different: plugin tries to write, fails
and spews an error, WP's output buffering makes the page blank, user
is confused. By enabling plugins to prevent such failures, WP would
become more solid to both plugin developers and users.

Big red letters may be a bit much... I dislike software that inspires  
panic with things like that which may or may not be a real issue.  
Still, I think it should be mentioned somewhere. The "Alerts" (or  
similar) tab on the Dashboard would keep it out of the way for people  
who are aware there's a problem, yet still allow you to see what's  
going on.

You could then include the ability to acknowledge or simply close an  
alert (anyone used Veritas Backup Exec? I'm thinking along the lines  
of their alerts here). After you acknowledge a respective error, it  
never shows back up again, or simply suppresses any visible  
notification and is confined to the special panel that displays that  
information exclusively. That way, we could tell people there may be  
something wrong on the Dashboard and point their attention to the  
Alerts area so they could investigate before their entire site blows  
up because their wp-content folder wasn't properly permissioned after  
a server migration (grrrrr again).

We would certainly want some method for dismissing errors, because  
there are a lot of situations in which this would come up -- if your  
host runs in safe mode and there's no way for you to change it, you  
don't want to get slapped with a big red error message every time you  
load a page.

I like this idea, because you're right. A lot of plugin / theme  
authors (myself included) don't do enough error checking -- it works  
on all the setups they've tested just fine, but then again they don't  
have PHP running in safe mode anywhere, so it barfs on some random  
user somewhere and no one knows why. If the plugin could just list a  
few requirements (we'd have to dumb them down, since I imagine a lot  
of people wouldn't know what safe mode allows or prohibits -- myself  
included again) and have WP check against them automagically when the  
plugin is activated, it'd be great.

So, did a certain someone just volunteer to write this code for us? :)

But in the vast majority of hosting situations (as most people are  
using shared hosting), this (safe mode) is NOT something that the  
user can fix on their own.

I quite like the way Drupal does this. It's been a while since I used 
it, but IIRC: in the admin screen, there's an error log, with the 
severity of the error clearly indicated (notices in white, warnings with 
a yellow triangle and errors with a red X). A description of the error 
and the time it occurred is given, and the user can filter or clear the 
list as they wish.

So long as the descriptions gave enough information for tech-savvy users 
to fix things themselves, and directed less-tech savvy users to places 
where they could find help, it'd be great.

If it is a host-config issue, it should be noted as such.  Given the 'need' 
for caching for optimizing performance of both core and plugins, things like

this should be flags that the host has a 'bad configuration' of sorts.

Most importantly, if plugins AND wp-core are making assumptions, for good 
reason, that wp-content should (and IMHO must) be writeable, that error 
should be left prominent (again, unless specifically 'dismissed' as others 
have proposed), as it'll affect things in major ways on that system.

Further, given the level of 'crap' in the dashboard (again, IMHO), this is 
something that ISN'T crap.  It should be at the same level as a notification

of pending security patches or major updates (that is, generally visible 
unless 'turned off' somehow).

(Once more: IMHO! ;) :) )

Granted, that'd be nice longer-term, but a simple messaging system could 
make it into a build in the near-term.  Very near term -- this isn't 
complex, and the cases to be 'detected' are already being detected.

Also, the onus should be on the plugin >system< to provide standard 
information to plugins, like 'this host cannot write to files', or 'this 
host can write to wp-content' -- well, a standard base set of 
queries/features.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Failing to find wp-config.php
Message-ID: <43D74096.20000@tamba2.org.uk>

Someone has emailed me because they are getting the message "There
doesn't seem to be a wp-config.php file. I need this before we can get
started." when they try to view the blog.
But they can access all aspects of admin just fine.
I don't know who the host is but given the number of forum posts that
would not seem to be a factor.

I've gone through their install and cannot see anything at all that
seems to be wrong - and if something _was_ wrong, surely admin wouldn't
work either ?

The forums give a nil return on answers and from reading threads it's
obviously very frustrating for both parties.

I've tried moving things about in wp-blog-header.php without success.
Anyone got any clues where I can start poking ? Solutions will of course
be posted to Codex.

Thanks,

We used to have a script on wordpress.org that you could call for the
latest version of WordPress, where's that?

Why are we limiting in the first place? It's not like there's going
this is going to be a big query anyway.

So the file was there? Is is readable? Is the directory explorable? Is
safe mode on (it can screw things up like file_exists)?

It does seem weird that the admin works. I think it's probably safe
mode causing the problem.

Nope..

safe_mode
	Off	Off
safe_mode_exec_dir
	no value	no value
safe_mode_gid
	Off	Off
safe_mode_include_dir
	no value	no value

The wp-config.php works because admin works.
In the Manage tab I can see the Hello World post, I can see the first
comment, change the theme - from inside the blog all looks good but when
it's looked from the outside, it fails.

We have this trac ticket sitting waiting for 2.1
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1476

Which uses these REST urls:

http://rpc.wordpress.org/latest-stable/version/
http://rpc.wordpress.org/latest-stable/date/
http://rpc.wordpress.org/latest-stable/link/
http://rpc.wordpress.org/latest-stable/svn/

Which all no longer seem to work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Determining URL from within a plugin
Message-ID: <DOMAINc0Ne0PaLI9mK600000055@domain.usa.tricycleinc.com>

I'm trying to figure out how to work out the URL of a file within a plugin.

For example, I have a plugin dir called "myplugin" with a file called
"myfile.php" within.  I need to determine the absolute URL of the
myfile.php.  The biggest problem I've come across is that the plugin file is
actually run from within /plugins.php, so most of the normal PHP SCRIPT_NAME
etc tags show the plugins.php page.  The only way I've found of finding the
full path is by using __FILE__ but this doesn't work so well for hosts that
use soft mount points to web sites with home directories.

Are there any config or option variables for the root URL of a Wordpress
site or the plugin directories?

Thanks all,

Matt

Okay, here's what I found with my testing:

In the shell, pwd was disabled. (Paranoid host?)

__FILE__ == 'test.php'
dirname(__FILE__) == 'test.php'
basename(__FILE__) == 'test.php'

This breaks wp-blog-header.php. I found a reliable test for this problem:

!file_exists(dirname(__FILE__).'/'.basename(__FILE__))

And a reliable method of setting ABSPATH in this case:
define('ABSPATH', dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']).'/');

What I still don't know is why the $*%@ thing acts this way.

$basename = str_replace('\\', '/', 
preg_replace('/^.*wp-content[\\\\\/]plugins[\\\\\/]/', '', __FILE__));
$pluginuri = get_settings('siteurl') . '/wp-content/plugins/' . $basename;

Or something like that there.

Update: That is NOT a reliable method of setting ABSPATH because it
breaks wp-admin. ABSPATH must be hardcoded for the blog to start to
work. Any other place __FILE__ is used will still be broken.

Their server is a Sun running php 4.2.3. There is a serious bug with
__FILE__ on that platform, wherein that magical constant does not
include the absolute path when located under ~. It has been reported
to work correctly under the Apache root. I think it is unreasonable to
require WordPress to work around that bug.

http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=13936
http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=27823

I don't intend to work any longer on this bug.

Wrong. It's still inside the if (!file_exists(...)){ ... } block

I personally use a few defines:

if ( !defined('site_url') )
{
	define('site_url', trailingslashit(get_settings('siteurl')));
}
if ( !defined('site_path') )
{
	define('site_path', str_replace(('http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']),
'', site_url));
}

and:

$plugin_path = str_replace(
					str_replace("\\", "/", ABSPATH),
					'',
					str_replace("\\", "/",
dirname(__FILE__))
					);

the str_replace("\\", "/", ...) prevents it from breaking on windows
platforms. and typically, you'll use $this->path within a class rather than
$plugin_path to avoid name collisions.

from there:

echo site_url;

http://yoursite.com/wp-dir/

echo site_path;

/wp-dir/

echo site_path . $plugin_path;

/wp-dir/wp-content/plugins/plugin-dir

echo site_path . $plugin_path . '/plugin-file.php';

/wp-dir/wp-content/plugins/plugin-dir/plugin-file.php


hope this helps.

Message-ID: <200601252244.k0PMiREk018737@post.webmailer.de>

I'm trying to use my keyboard to insert quicktags instead of having to click
on a quicktags button every time.

For example, pressing Alt+b inserts the 'bold' tag.

Unfortunately, selecting a piece of text and then pressing Alt+b doesn't
surround the text with the opening and closing tags like pressing on the
quicktag button would do, but rather only inserts the opening tag.

 

Is there a quick way to fix this?

 

Thanks.

Hi,

I'm trying to localize my WordPress 2.0 plugin
(http://soderlind.no/ImageManager) and discovered that
load_plugin_textdomain('ImageManager'); still looks for the
ImageMananger-$locale.mo file in wp-content/plugins.

Any plans for changing this in the near future? I'd prefer that
load_plugin_textdomain() looks in the same folder as the plugin is
installed (ImageManager is installed in wp-content/plugins/ImageManager).

Kind regards,
Per - http://soderlind.no

Hi,

It's already implemented!  You can set the directory yourself:

define ("IM_DIR", "wp-content/plugins/ImageManager/");
define ("IM_DOMAIN", "ImageManager");

load_plugin_textdomain(IM_DOMAIN, IM_DIR);

Then:

__('A returned string', IM_DOMAIN);
_e('An echoed string', IM_DOMAIN);

Hope this helps,

Jamie.

Alternatively, I think you can use...

load_plugin_textdomain('ImageManager',$path = 
'wp-content/plugins/ImageManager');

Well, of course.

The definitions were edited out of a plugin where I require the information in other places in the
code as well.  Plus, if you wanted to change the plugin domain because there was a clash (unlikely)
or if you changed the plugin name, you'd only need to update it in one place.  And having some kind
of definition for the plugin path is useful anyway (as discussed in another topic).

Message-ID: <74b84aa30601251809j17c71ebam4f49049abcd31b66@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

My blog with less than a 1000 posts weighs slightly over 0.5MB in a
gzip format and is over 3MB (bare minimum, without any extra tables
like stats and other optional stuff). I am worried that sooner or
later the database is going to be a big fat pig that will refuse to
fly in one piece (backup and restore). On a lowest common denominator
level, this could get a lot worse for a lot of users: dial-up, hosts
that do not offer a command line, etc. As a user myself (with a decent
DSL connection and host) still dread the idea of squashing the db and
uploading afresh from the backup for the fear of not completing the
upload.

Are you guys thinking of something that could ease this pain and keep
the pig always in air? :)

In a layman's terms, I was thinking of an idea: how about if the
database can be backed-up and restored incrementally like "per year"
or "per number of posts" in addition to the default option of a full
backup and restore. I seriously think the "per year" or "per number of
posts" concept is a good idea (provided of course the core contents of
a database are not modified in between versions. Do you think I'm
totally off?

As always, a huge WordPress fan.

Cheers,

Not necessarily true. Nearly all my plugins that deal with posts use 
post meta data for one thing or another.

You have raised a good point, particularly when it comes to slow connections
and restrictive Web hosts. Nevertheless, many hosts continue to permit the
cron job functionalities while denying command-line access. My host is
among them, so one can set up a cron job to sqldump the database onto the
Web server automatically.

If you fear the idea of restoring a database, then your fear is in vain. We
are all victims of paranoia at times. There were only two situations I can
recall where database restoration went awry or was lossy. With WordPress, a
restoration I once attempted led to an issue with a table that's associated
with PDF creation settings. Settings were easy to restore manually though.
With phpWiki, I once uploaded a database with excess verbage. Everything
else was fine.

Remember that a failed upload can be superseded by a second attempt. If
needed, you can confer somebody else for help, provided you keep the raw
product (sqldump).


> Are you guys thinking of something that could ease this pain and keep

If you habitually save your database off-server, then you could just store
the 'diff' between the current database state and yesterday's state. For
example, consider the following cron job:

0 0 * * 0,2,4,6 mysqldump --user <username> --password=<your_pass>
<your_database>  > ~/tmp/blog.dump;

0 0 * * 1,3,5 mysqldump --user <username> --password=<your_pass>
<your_database>  > ~/tmp/blog2.dump;

5 0 * * * diff  ~/tmp/blog.dump ~/tmp/blog2.dump >>
~/public_html/<your_hidden_dir>/recent_additions

This does not obviate the need for full backups, but it keeps you on the
'safe side' more frequently.

I think that Scott (skippy) might wish to consider this. He's the WP 'backup
man'. Light backups ought to help scalability, yet without potential clutter
(maybe "advanced" tab).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Need more RSS hooks
Message-ID: <43D8B253.4090808@zenenet.com>

I want to style my feed.  I have no way of doing this without modifying
my wp-rss(2).php file.
I don't want to do this.  I want to drop in and remove plugins with
various XSL changes.

Please give us more rss hooks, or at least just this one more!

When I was initially looking... I thought that rss(2)_head was going to
be the hook I wanted, 'lo and behold, it's in the xml structure itself.

So, I'm going to be redundant:
I want to be able to slap in ANYTHING (in my case, an <?xml-stylesheet
?>) in between between the <?xml ?> declaration and the root element.

I think the gotcha is going to be the name... rss(2)_dec ?
I dunno.  What do you guys think?

you can do this by throwing an output buffer handler on the init hook.

The database backup utility is provided as a very simple method for 
users without command-line experience to create backups of their 
databases.  Anything more complex than "Push this button to backup these 
tables" should probably be addressed with a more advanced backup solution.

Seriously, if the size of a daily transfer is a problem, sign up for a 
/free/ Gmail account, and send the backups there.  Even uncompressed at 
3MB/day, a whole month of daily backups will use 93MB of space, which is 
less than 3.5% of my current total capacity at Gmail.  You could visit 
your Gmail account once every two years to clean out the old backups.

When something goes wrong, blow away the WordPress tables then grab the 
latest backup from Gmail and pump it through phpMyAdmin.  You're back 
online with minimal fuss.  Better yet, if the latest backup exhibits the 
same issues, you've likely got daily backups available going back to a 
time when things were still working.  And you don't have to worry about 
duplicate keys, since every backup is a complete backup.

With my hosting account my host provides an off-site FTP server for 
backups.  I asked skippy once about including support for transferring 
backups via FTP instead of email.  He wisely told me that any host that 
offers such "advanced" features is going to provide better tools than 
wp-db-backup for making use of them.  With cron and a couple lines of 
shell script, I can do much better.

The plugin is for folks who want simple and don't have the tools.  If 
you want better, consider upgrading your hosting to something that has 
shell access and use one of the many MySQL backup scripts laying around.

That's my thought.  Now skippy will probably make changes to the plugin.  ;)

Isn't this list supposed to ignore meta keys that start with an underscore?

Absolutely.  The backup plugin is a convenience for people who need to
backup, but are intimidated (or confused) by phpMyAdmin.  It's an effort
to easily give people peace of mind in the event that their site blows
up / gets hacked / falls into a space-time rift.

For a long time I've silently wished that someone would step up and
write the corresponding "Restore" plugin.  That's not something I'm
going to do, and it's increasingly obvious that no one else is going to
do it either.

That's not a big deal, though: you should only need to restore your
database once, when you're recovering from a disaster.  In this
scenario, I see nothing wrong with following Podz's excellent instructions:
   http://www.tamba2.org.uk/wordpress/restore/

Actually, the problem with big backups is that the _restore_ caps the
size of the import, either because of phpMyAdmin, or PHP upload filesize
limits, or simple browser timeouts.  But, as you note, if you've got a
gigantic site, you likely have a reasonable account with your reasonable
hosting provider, and other tools are available to you.

I suppose a one-file-per-table export might be a good idea, to alleviate
the need to manually split the backup into separate files in order to
load them one at a time into phpMyAdmin -- but then, where do we stop?
It'll only be a matter of time before someone wants X number of rows per
backup file because they have a ginormous database.

In the end, I think the backup plugin is good as it is.  It's easy to
use, and does what it was designed to do.  Restoration is a different beast.

So you burn your backup, send it to a friend, they upload and your host
runs a commandline instruction to import it.
And then you find out the character set has changed.

Like Skippy says, backup is the easy bit.

I have known people go through 1000 posts and comments simply because
character set differences have caused major problems.

I really don't like output buffering, but I'll mess with this in the
interim.

Though I have to say, I REALLY would like this hook.  If for no other
reason that future-proofing feeds as well.

Does anyone else agree/disagree that this hook idea is beneficial?

I agree. I was looking at the same thing recently and finally gave up  
because of the lack of hooks. It's no wonder I couldn't find a plugin  
to stylize my feed.

Sounds like a good thing to add while we're consolidating all our  
feeds into one script (http://asymptomatic.net/2006/01/17/2216/no- 
more-feeds-for-wordpress/), eh? :)

I agree and this is something I've wanted as well.  Output buffering
is a great sledgehammer solution when no other option is available,
but a hook would probably be more efficient.

True, but at some point, how many hooks do we end up with? A file full 
of hooks, and nothing else? Could be interesting, if not confusing.

That said, I'm rather surprised that WP feeds *don't* come with some 
styleing anyway. XSL styleing works in all the major browsers and gives 
people a chance to not be scared off by RSS. You can even do advanced 
things like what feedburner does in presenting subscription options and 
an explanation of what the user is looking at.

This, of course, would assume that people could *click* the RSS links 
without getting that horrendous pop up "The link you followed can't be 
identified by the feed:// address structure blah bla bla."

I agree it's beneficial. Then I can stop hacking at wp-rss2.php each 
time I upgrade. (Well, for an XSL stylesheet anyway...)

Feeds are made to be syndicated, read by a feedreader, and not much
more. The point of RSS is for when people do not want to visit your
site every five minutes to read your content, they just want a
stripped down version of your content that an aggregator can read, and
they can click the links back to your site if they like. XSL defeats
the purpose of creating feeds in the first place, you're essentially
making a second website for people to come and visit, which is really
a silly idea.

That said, I have objection to including the hook, but I do to ever
including XSL by default in WP, its just silly bloat.

IMO, having some simple XSL that displays a quick notice about what RSS 
is and how to use the feed works wonders for novice users who have no 
idea what RSS is. Check the BBC's feeds, for example:

http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml

Something similar for Wordpress - in plugin form at least - would be great.

Agreed. Your 'average user' might be better served with an instructional 
page explaining what RSS is rather than "a page of computer code" which 
leaves them puzzled.

See what FeedBurner does, explain things and provide links:

   http://feeds.feedburner.com/feediconsreleases

In the case of my videoblog, I specifically provide links to 
video-capable aggregators people can download to get the enclosures. Any 
podcasting site using WordPress might want to do the same.

Perhaps XSL was the wrong tech I was thinking of. Consider XSL-Stylesheets.

The difference between this:
  - http://www.petefreitag.com/rss/

and this:
  - http://jrm.cc/feed

is a magnitude of two lines in the RSS feed and 665bytes in the stylesheet.

Yet, for a technology with an adoption rate at a terribly low 11%[1][2] 
it'd be a useful UI enhancement that, if nothing else, would help to 
educate and evangelize the use of RSS instead of scaring off user when 
presented with:

  - http://somethingunpredictable.com/feed/

Um... I'm a newbie on this list so take what I say with a grain of salt
perhaps but XSL is NOT bloat.  It may be silly but its not bloat.  Its
fairly essential for making feeds easy for end users.

End users will click on feed and right now they go "What?" and its a support
issue for the individual author of wordpress.  Why in the world do we want
that?

Now if I was to put my commercial hat on I'd point out that shipping XSL
with Wordpress which put in links to recommended aggregators is a huge $$$
opportunity.  You don't think that Pluck, a company which raised 8.5 meg in
venture money, got their link into FeedBurner for free did you?

And given that FeedBurner is a disaster waiting to happen (they've inserted
a single point of failure into the ecosystem) I'd LOVE to see XSL standard
w/ wordpress.  That would likely cut down on their subscriptions by
something like 1/4 to 1/3.

Single points of failure are, I'm sorry, evil.

Any chance there could be a button somewhere that deletes the current
cache ? An increasing response in the forums is to use ftp and delete
the contents of the cache be it to see theme changes, because of user
login problems. Having a button somewhere would assist this while still
allowing the cache to be used - and also when someone does not have ftp
access but the cache is being problematic in some way.

Sounds like a good addition to WP. In the meantime, I'll throw  
together a plugin as soon as I finish lunch.

Plugin has been posted: http://incoherentcode.com/projects/cache- 
purge-plugin/

Very rough, and I have to admit I'm not terribly good with dealing  
with files through PHP, so there's plenty of room for improvement,  
I'm sure. It was a pain to avoid using exec() or system(), but since  
those may or may not be available, it's all done using dir commands  
through PHP.

Let me know if you have any problems, or spot some place that could  
be improved.

Erm, wp_cache_flush()?

I'm writing a core patch to do this.

Hmm... Without digging into the caching code, I assumed there was  
some sort of problem related to actually flushing the cache, hence it  
needing to be manually done...

Perhaps I stand corrected (which would be good, even if I did waste  
an hour of company time fooling around with this).

On the plus side, I did get a good laugh out of it when I forgot to  
tack on 'wp-content/cache' to the end of my directory string and  
inadvertently deleted my entire test install...

Hey, what's life without humor?

'Manually' means using wp_cache_flush(). There is no way to do it in
the admin yet.

Okay, here's my patch. It isn't tested much since I can't get my cache
to aquire a lock, which is odd. It should work, though. Give it a
patch -p0 < file and click Options -> Clear Cache.

For reference, announcements@ is also on the spammers target list. I had 
  a list named that and I got 20-30 spams daily. None made it to the 
list, but unfortunately as the list owner, they all made it to me.

Actually, I think this is a geniune idiot, much like we've had on this
list before, and not necessarily a spam target. Oh, and this is
wp-hackers (not just hackers@)

A reference for you and everyone else. The WP Cache code is pluggable,
so a simple deletion of these files is an unreliable way to flush the
cache. Memcached for example, stores its cache in RAM, so you need to
run the provided flushing method.

I really like how Feedburner does this, especially with the links to 
subscribe in different aggregators. We could kill the feed: links and 
embed them in the XSL, which may save some support questions since feed: 
hasn't been adopted like I hoped.

This is exactly what I object to including. Syndication feeds are
meant to be fetched by a feed aggregator, read by the software, and
shown to the user, not displayed like a webpage in a browser. Hoever,
I hadn't thought of using XSL to show something like feedburner does
to browsers, that's a completely different story, and I'd much prefer
we display no content to the user and show them a message about how to
view RSS feeds in a reader than a syled list of my posts like belongs
on my webpage.

On that note, I'm completely against displaying paid advertisements
for any specific aggregator

The point is not that this should replace your blog or anything  
conspiratorial like that. We're simply trying to show people a pretty  
page that actually contains useful information, rather than some raw  
XML that would leave someone who doesn't have a clue what RSS is  
wondering what the hell they did wrong. If I didn't know it was XML  
and that I should subscribe to it in my feed reader, I'd imagine the  
page was farked or that my browser didn't support it, and I know  
there are others out there who will be thinking the same thing.

We're also not talking about forcing styles on anyone. If you want to  
ensure that only people who know what they're doing get your RSS feed  
and subscribe to it manually, that's certainly your choice and more  
power to you. For the rest of us who don't mind getting inexperienced  
users hooked on a great technology by evangelizing its use and  
benefits in our feeds (for a whopping 600 bytes of overhead  
apparently) rather than leaving them cold and confused, it would be  
nice if the hooks were at least present in the base software so we  
can do it ourselves (remember, this conversation started by simply  
asking for these hooks to be present so a plugin could be written to  
apply a stylesheet, not by asking that styling be added by default in  
WP -- although I think it should, personally).

And before someone hurts me, I think there should be a configuration  
option to turn on and off any native styling WP may decide to apply  
to feeds in the future...

Did I miss something? When were we talking about aggregators? :)

But on that note, if anyone would like to pay me to display an "Add  
to <quality aggregator>" button on my blog (*cough* FeedLounge  
*cough* Newsgator), I would be more than happy to accept your money,  
for I am poor and still trying to pay off my new PowerBook...

Yes... Obviously we'll need to start creating themes and a theme 
architecture *just* for the feeds...

(I'm only 1/2 joking...)

And my original email was clearly a reply to the email that suggested
that this be in the core. Like I said before, hooks are fine, but
sticking stuff in the core is unneccessary.

The general methodology in WP for years has been to have as few
options as possible, so even if styling got put in, there's a 1 in 10
chance that an option would be put in.

My bad then. I skipped a few messages in between there and your snip

Perhaps now would be a good time to change that attitude then?  
Styling is obviously a somewhat well-wanted feature, and I can't see  
not having an option to turn something that major off...

And to comment on someone else's mention of developing an entire  
theme set based around feed styles, I really don't think that'd be a  
major thing... It wouldn't need its own type of style, just let the  
overall site theme handle the style -- and add a way to override it  
with a plugin, perhaps?

Or just add the hooks that started all this and let independent  
developers take it wherever they want to...

I still don't see how we got from hooks for the rss feeds to paying  
to advertise aggregators. Talk about tangents...

Roy, cron jobs intimidate end-users. Let me explain below.

Owen, I do this every week. I was not speaking for myself, but in
general. More on that below.

Guys, thanks for your thoughts, truly appreciate it. My point is not
how a geek or an experienced user works when he backs-up or restores.
As Scot says (and I quote again):

Scot Merrill wrote:

Yes, this *is* the crux of the matter, but not just limited to it. And
the tribe of such people is going to increase exponentially as
blogging becomes not just popular, but a way of life and work. And
when they start adding content to their systems, the database is going
to become bigger and bigger. It will become so big one day (depending
upon how active the content creation is) that it will refuse to be
restored in one piece, whether it is via phpmyadmin or via a future
plugin. I am very sure you'll start to see this in Support questions
very soon. Then what do you do? Would you tell the user to change to a
host with more tools? This is like sidelining the problem, not
attacking it.

Put on an end-user's hat for a minute and forget that you've heard of
anything called cron job or phpmyadmin. The end user will only look
under the Dashboard and think, oh hell, I don't have a way to download
my work and restore it. Or if he tries on a very large db (say 5-10MB
file gzipped), he's going to feel the heat and hairpull.

Ideally the WordPress system would check the size of the backup and
say: "Your database size is over 2MB gzipped, would you prefer
downloading incrementally? We have one or two options (by year or
category, lets limit to one or these two options max)". And in the
same way offer an incremental restore as well (in addition to a full
restore in one shot).

Let's look at some keywords: cron job, gmail backup, convenience,
one-file-per-table export, split-backup

Are we not talking so much geek for most end-users, that this is
incomprehensible? For a universal adoption of the application (whether
by a geek or by an end user), simplifying things for the user is a
must and a great idea. I am quite aware of the enormous burden of
coding that comes with the idea of simplification. But would you see a
smile on every user when he sees such options? Hell, yes!

A few points:
1. Database Content
Logs make that explode in size, not users (generally).
What users need to do is drop all the stats, all the logs and every
table that is not essential if they are either backing up or moving. (I
had someone ask me to cron backup their stats log last week....people
get so retentive about pointless stuff). So the way forward for the vast
majority of users is to educate them about what is needed to get their
blog working and to leave the fluff behind.

2. Restoring in one piece
Doesn't take a lot for that to not happen. Text editor that can handle
huge files, cut / paste / repeat unless it has been exported as tables.
But whose fault is it ? phpmyadmin ? mysql ? If those pieces of code are
widely used then someone somewhere must have a solution - this is not a
WP exclusive.

3. Support Questions
Yes they happen - but it's character encoding more than db size, and db
size is doable. Boring as hell but doable. Move someone's Spanish blog
that's just 2meg uncompressed and you'll probably have a lot more
problems than a 10meg gzipped English blog.

Size just isn't a factor.
phpmyadmin versions, mysql versions, character sets - all 3 mixed
together by different hosts is what makes people frustrated.

Yes, that's right. That's why I mentioned it in my first posting:

Education is a good idea. Still better, if that education comes where
the user is doing it--in the backup administration area before he/she
presses go.

I am not saying it is WP exclusive nor am I blaming (no way; WP is
excellent as it is already), but is there a chance where it can be
improved futher upon (sort of near future proof), just like the
5-minute install. Seriously, "the 5-minute install" is such a hit. The
minute I tried, I was raving. I still do.

Yeah, this would also kill the 1 meter long line of "subscribe to" buttons on
much blogs. Would be appreciated.

Do you know if there's a feed equivalent to Mailto being talked about 
anywhere?

Because to my untrained eye, it seems like it would be a nice solution 
to this problem of passing links off to desktop based handlers instead 
of a fake protocol link...

feed:. It's what we use at the moment in WordPress. It's not widely
enough adopted.

I disagree. Feeds are terrible from a user's point of view at the
moment. As things stands, we have a 'protocol not supported message'
-- not the friendliest thing we could tell a user. Taking feed:/ away
would leave just a plain XML file, again, not particularily friendly.
Using XSL is really the only solution around this usability hole.

As for your worries about duping the website, I'd first say that these
concerns are secondary to that of the usability hole. Secondly, I'd be
tempted to say 'who cares'? They're still reading your words. Hell,
they're even using less bandwidth by reading the cut-down version. As
long as we provide enough linkage to the main site so 1) people don't
get confused about the two versions and 2) people can appreciate your
graphical masterpiece if they so wish, then I really don't see what
the problem is.

Ok, long thread, I may have missed but here's my ?0.02 :

I am a big fan of XSLT, but it's not needed for putting a
human-friendly face on feeds. CSS can do it, e.g. see [1].

The feed: URI scheme may be expedient, but it's web-architecturally
pretty awful, and certainly shouldn't be seen as a long-term solution
to feed subscription (at best it's a workaround for RSS 2.0's lack of
a standard mime type). See [2] for some discussion.

On a broader point, although the most common use for feeds is as
bare-bones content deliverers allowing aggregated reading, this is
only one application of syndication. In the CMS case it's possible to
deliver much more information about the site in a
machine-readable/processable form - an example would be the categories
and user lists. Aggregators have the potential to be *way* smarter
than they are today, but it's a chicken & egg situation. A small step
towards bootstrapping improvements would be to make more information
available in the feeds - it's comparatively low cost (considerably
less that presenting the HTML rendering, not least because styling
isn't an issue) for potentially large benefit.

Cheers,
Danny.

The issue is not XSL/XSLT
The issue is the hook.
Looking at your example, you demonstrate my request perfectly.
You still need a hook in order to link to the stylesheet (sanely, that is).

How you do it, you're right, is no issue.  But you need to be able to do it.

P.S. (To everyone) I didn't expect my request to get so much chatter.  <3 :D

Should I post this to trac?  Or has someone already?

Agreed.  The issue is the hook.  Thanks for stepping up and being
clear.  That helped me at least.

Yep, sorry Jason, I managed to miss the original point entirely.

fwiw, to me it looks like an additional hook would be a good idea in
the short term, in lieu of more significant refactoring/modularisation
of the feed script(s).

Cheers,
Danny.

Yes, but it's easier to work with if you use XSLT along with CSS. I
don't see any problem with using XSLT, using something for a purpose
its not designed for is only a problem if the technology doesn't suit
what you need it for; in thise case XSLT does a superb job of styling
feeds.

For those that are saying that the hook is the main problem, here's my
reasons why something like this should be core:

1) feed: and plain XML is a usability hole.
2) What happens if two scripts try to output an <?xml-stylesheet ?>?
Which XSLT transform template does the browser use?
3) Similarly with CSS, we could have declaration clashes.

Agreed, but availability of XSLT (client side) will need to be
considered (see below).

Agreed.

A little digging didn't reveal much, but this (fairly old) post
suggests there are no real guarantees of what will happen client side:

http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200207/msg01421.html

However this does sound like the kind of thing that could happen
anywhere such a hook is provided. I'm not yet familiar with the WP
source, but for a hypothetical example, if there was a hook into the
inclusion of the HTML footer, then </html> could appear twice,
breaking the markup.

Cheers,
Danny.

Hey all, first time poster... Here's my $.02

While I do think that the feed: handling  (and RSS handling in general) is a
little funny (aka nonexistent) in the current browsers, from what I've read,
the next gen of browsers (firefox in 2.0, IE7, and Safari already, can't
vouch for Opera) will handle raw RSS feeds and reformat them according to
whatever the developers of those products sees fit. This may be a moot
point.

That being said, I have read talk via the wordpress blogs that there is a
bit of unrest over the current state of the feed code as is, and that a
redesign may be in order. If that's the case, Personally I think the best
method here may be to integrate an RSS XSLT/ stylesheet into the theme
system, and if the designer of the theme wants to show more than a raw XML
feed, then they would have the power to do it. otherwise, the default would
be to simply send out a raw feed, as it does now. This could satisfy the
need for additional hooks into the feeds, if I've understood this
conversation to date.

one thing that bugs me with styling the rss is that Firefox devs happily

They're right. You're wrong.

Sorry to be so blunt, but this is not a bug. If there's a bug here, it's 
the attempt hide markup in a CDATA section.

According to the spec, "An XSLT processor is not required to support 
disabling output escaping....Since disabling output escaping may not 
work with all XSLT processors and can result in XML that is not 
well-formed, it should be used only when there is no alternative."

Escaped markup in XML is certainly more trouble than it's worth. Norm
Walsh has a couple of good pieces on the matter [1,2] (I'll wager you
have too, Elliotte ;-) . It's ugliness is reflected in certain
ambiguous specs and inconsistent app behaviour.

Not far from the topic of this thread, this is a very compelling
reason that if WP was to support *only one* feed format (by default)
it shouldn't be RSS 2.0.

The classic case in RSS was when Reuters had stock ticker symbols in
their content, e.g.

"blah blah <GOOG> blah"

which went into the feed as :

<description>blah blah &lt;GOOG&gt; blah</description>

- and every single RSS reader rendered this as

"blah blah  blah"

Sam Ruby's got a write-up at [3], as he put it: "Your titles and
descriptions can be 100% valid according to the RSS specification. 
And yet not work as you intend in any aggregator."

Fortunately there is now Atom.

Cheers,
Danny.

And I still have problems with WordPress (and wordpress.com) when using 
< (less than symbol) in a title. This is know and the "Ringnalda effect" 
around some parts...

Go ahead, try to create a post with a title of <title> and see what happens.

I read it, it says that we can't have alternative stylesheets for
printing/other devices. Loud cries of 'who cares' ring around my skull
:) We don't need to use different _XSLT_ stylesheets for printing,
etc. Different _CSS_ stylesheets, but we can manage that (XSLT outputs
HTML if we want it to, which can do different media stylesheets). It's
just for the main site: different CSS is necessary, but not different
markup.

I think XSLT is the best way forward. Every browser supports it, it
plugs the usability hole brilliantly.

My comments about multiple <?xml-stylesheet ?>s were regarding
plugins: if we let plugins in here, then we might get more than one.
If we manage it in the core, so such worries.

Ah, I thought that was a weird timespace continuum thing (possibly
involving cheesy snacks).

Literally "<title>" vanished without a trace in regular HTML blog
view. HTML validator grumbled about element not being allowed there,
Feed validator happy.

Now trying "&lt;title&gt;", looks ok in regular view & validators,
awaiting aggregated view...

Cheers,
Danny.

Hmm, last time I checked several didn't - Amaya, Lynx, not sure about
(audio) readers, I doubt whether a good proportion of the mobile
browsers have XSLT.

Another question might be what other agent's behaviour is likely to be
on encountering the XSLT reference.  (I can't remember what the docs
say on this point, need to read up). It wouldn't exactly be desirable
for an RSS aggregator to read an RSS feed, transform it into HTML and
wonder what went wrong...

It does sound potentially a lot better than raw XML.

What specificaly did you have in mind, something like including a
default stylesheet in the feed, where the user could swap it's URI?

Cheers,
Danny.

I'm sure aggregators ignore XSLT. Otherwise that would be REALLY dumb.

I was thinking theme-definable.

Amaya is a virtually featureless browser that exists only to pimp W3C 
standards - how many people do you know that use it as a primary 
browser? Regardless, its CSS support is so hideous that it would make a 
lack of XSLT support the least of someone's worries. Aggregators will 
obviously ignore XSLT, since if they do display feed data visually it 
will usually be in a uniform way, either through their own XSLT or 
through other methods.

Seriously, including some pretty XSLT does nothing to affect the 
usability of the feeds; those technologies that don't support it, either 
through incompetence (like Amaya) or deliberately (like aggregators) 
will simply ignore it. It would, however, provide a significant benefit 
to most users, who would rather be confronted by a nice message when 
they click a feed link, not a bunch of XML that makes them think they've 
broken something.

I can't see why compatibility is an issue at all.

For what it's worth, I'm seeing an increasing number of feed links
show up as search results in Google recently. (See the second entry if
you google "wordpress support thread feed plugins" for an example.)
Don't know if this is a google issue, a robots.txt issue or what not,
but I don't think its safe to assume that people will only encounter
feeds via aggregators anymore.

I hacked together some XSLT to give us all something to talk about.
patch -p0 < patchfile from the attachment, give it a whirl.

Some problems:

1) Konqueror doesn't transform the feed. I have unconfirmed reports
that Safari doesn't either.
2) Atom support isn't there. Firefox and Konqueror (the browsers I
tested in) get scared off by Atom's mime type and prompt the user to
download it. They don't recognise it as XML, so they don't transform
it. We have two options here: give up or serve as text/xml (I guess
the latter won't be too popular). Really, browsers should recognise
application/atom+xml as something they can parse as XML and do so.

The Atom problem is fairly major. Users getting prompted to download
files out of the blue is still a usability hole.

No RSS 1.0 support, but I remember the tags being so similar that the
same XSLT can be used for both. Experiment.

Firefox 2 will, the patch is in progress. It will also ignore your
styling, and display its own subscription interface instead of the
feed itself, and I have the impression (without actually having a copy
to see) that IE 7 will show the feed with its own styling, so I
wouldn't put too much effort into WP styling: you're maybe looking at
a couple of years until hardly anyone will ever see it.

Hey guys,

I'm trying to get into writing wordpress plugins.  Writing my first  
one now!  However, I'm having a lot of trouble getting it to work  
with mod rewrite.  I'm running the latest version of wordpress 2.0.1  
(rc1).

Maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong?  I'd really  
appreciate it!

Also, when I type in the query ?ld_home=1, the template does load  
correctly.  It's just the mod rewrite that is not working.

Code to at the bottom:

Thanks,
Eric



------

function ld_rewrite_rules($old_rules)
{
	$my_rules['directory/'] = '/index.php?ld_home=1';
	
	return array_merge($my_rules, $old_rules);
}
add_filter('rewrite_rules_array','ld_rewrite_rules');



function ld_query_var(&$query_vars)
{
	$query_vars[] = 'ld_home';
	
	return $query_vars;
}
add_filter('query_vars','ld_query_var');

function ld_template()
{
	
	$template= false;
	
	if (get_query_var('ld_home') != "") {	
	
		$template = "ld_home.php";
	}
	
	if ($template) {
	
		$template_dir = ABSPATH . 'wp-content/themes/' . get_settings 
('template');
		if (file_exists($template_dir . '/ld_home.php') ) {
			include($template_dir . '/ld_home.php');
			exit;
		} else {
			include(ABSPATH . 'wp-content/plugins/linkingdirectory/templates/ 
ld_home.php');
			exit;
		}
		return;
	
	}
}
add_action('template_redirect','ld_template');

These browsers won't see widespread adoption for years yet, this isn't
wasted effort.

Phil, sorry, I haven't had chance to look back at the specs yet - do
you happen to know offhand how the behaviour is determined for user
agents when hitting a stylesheet decl? What I can't see yet is how,
say, an Atom aggregator /should/ apply the hatom2atom.xsl when it
encounters HTML but /not/ the atom2html.xsl  when it hits an Atom feed
containing the decl.

Cheers,
Danny.

Can I make what may be a clue free comment?  *Response from the crowd:
Sure Scott!  Go be dumb*.

Its strikes me that there's an easy model for how to do the css / xslt
for Feeds from Wordpress: FeedBurner.  Bear in mind that they're a
smart, well funded company that likely has knocked over all the issues
wrt browser compatibility, etc.  Why doesn't someone (and oh crap I
think I just volunteered) look at how FeedBurner does it and then set
up the stubs for that for WordPress.  Clearly we can't copy their
templates but we could, for example, duplicate their approach and then
let one of the (very talented) WordPress CSS folk go with it from
there.

Thoughts?

Scott

Yes, I do believe you just volunteered to setup and then re-download  
all your formats of feeds in FeedBurner and examine their differences.

You're such a nice guy sometimes, Scott... Really...

Have you tried dumping out the rewrite rules to check the order that they are being applied in?

You can print_r the result of your array_merge() to check that they're in the correct order.

Also, you could try this:

echo "Match: " ; print_r($match);

after the line $this->matched= $match; in classes.php on or about line 1545.

Which will tell you what rule is being matched.  That might give you a bit more information to help
you debug.

Cheers,

Jamie.

Subject: [wp-hackers] forum integration
Message-ID: <43DB40C7.2050207@fastmail.fm>

Hello,

My wp is becoming increasingly important to me, but I still find myself 
posting on a lot of forums. So I have been thinking a lot lately about 
how wp could be used to integrate with various message boards. Would it 
be possible to hack a plugin together that would do the following;

1. when posting to a forum, also post to wp
2. when a reply to post on forum is made, wp updates comments into 
threads accordingly.
3. wp notification of posts of interest

This would of course need some hacking of forum software, but in theory 
it should be possible. I am thinking of a -also post to blog- checkbox 
type function, so people can opt in. Although I am not sure what the 
situation is with smf, phpbb, and vbulletin hooks.

If blogs really are the simplest way to realise cultural capital into 
filthy money, then it would be great to have a central place for forum 
posts - regardless of which forum they are posted in.

Is this a complete non starter? If not, is anyone interested?

Regards,
John

bbpress looks very interesting, and I am reading through the 
documentation. But it looks like it integrates its own forum. What I was 
thinking about was integrating external forums.

All are very possible, depending on the capabilities of the bbs,
but in each case you're effectively talking about extensions or
plugins to the forum software, not WordPress.

Sorry, I misunderstood you. bbPress IS forum software, based on the WP core.

It initially sounds as though bbPress < http://bbpress.org/ > would be a
suitable vocation. However, you are clearly referring to third-party forums
(?). You must adopt some new posting habits and combine them with scripts to
automate the process. This also depends on the bulletin board S/W in

No context? Purely SEO purposes?

Sounds like bbPress, which is actually worth considering.

What would be the purpose and what about content duplicability (mirroring)?
What about consent from participants?

phpBB has a syndication mod, which I recommend you take advantage of to
cater for requirement (3).

I'd take Kaf's opinion on this. I consider blogs to be filthier than forums,
but /hey/! That's just me...


> Is this a complete non starter? If not, is anyone interested?


Blogs are improperly built to accommodate multi-user forum posts. As an
analogy, rarely should you use forum software to build an image gallery.
Open Source CMS software is often generalised enough to fit other functions
(I happen to use Wikis to talk to friends and family), yet 'doability' never
implies optimality. Use the right tool for the job at hand. Stick with
forums or explore to find SEO-friendly BB packages that understand feeds.

Trackbacks work :)
In RC-1 as announced they didn't if you ran php as cgi but Ryan and Andy
got that sorted and my testblog is now sending (I had 4 emails yesterday
 asking why a trackback people had made 3 weeks ago suddenly came
through). Go try:

Aggregators do currently ignore XSLT, but visual styling is only one
application. There could potentially be a lot of utility. If a
document in an aggregator-unknown XML format includes reference to an
XSLT stylesheet, that could provide the translation necessary into one
of the formats the agg *does* know (this is pretty much the idea
behind microformats/GRDDL).

So I think it would be very wrong to assume aggregrators will never
use XSLT and close the door on possible syndicate/aggregate
applications just to make WP's feed look a bit prettier when displayed
through a degenerate user agent. I don't think this will be problem,
just that any visual styling XSLT ref will need to be clearly
identifiable as such (and I will need to read the specs very soon...)

I think your basic conclusion is probably right - that there's nothing
to lose here. Even if only 50% of HTML browsers get the benefit of the
styling, that's still an improvement over 100% seeing raw XML (or
CSS-styled XML).

There's no answer to that.

Two thoughts from someone who built a feed search engine and did the XSLT /
CSS thing:

It really did help cut down on support queries. I manned the support "lines"
before and after as I always did and I saw a marked difference.

+1 on deprecating feed: It makes links to feeds non clickable for most users
(example - I use a web based aggie so I can't even click on many wordpress
feeds to see them when I need to. ).

*ducks* because he knows that this is controversial.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Extending query_posts?
Message-ID: <e9149f87562c0c836f1900351aa751be@imap.scorpionshops.com>


I am trying to learn how to write plug-ins, and at the moment I'm trying to create a "display random posts from a certain category"-plugin. I've tried Skippys version, and looked around for more, but I would like to have something that feels like less of a hack, and more of an extension, with correct usage of The Loop and so forth.

I've been thinking along two lines of how do achieve this. First off, the preferred way to do this would be to modify the query_posts results, but I'm thinking that doing that with the get_posts hook seems awfully unoptimized. So, in essence, I would like to first interpret the parameters sent to query_posts, then do my own search based on that, getting just post IDs, choose the required number of random posts, rewrite the entire query to just get the specific posts, and then relinquish control of the query.

The second way to do this, in my mind, would be to create a new query_posts function, that has similar syntax as the orginal one, and also gets a new iteration of The Loop going. the advantage with this approach would be that I can add parameters as I go along, with less possibility of rewriting queries the wrong way.

A few example queries might explain what I'm talking about, in the odd chance that I totally obfuscated it above:

<?php query_posts('category_name=special_cat&showposts=4&random=true'); ?>
<?php query_random_posts('category_name=special_cat&showposts=4'); ?>

Either of these should be followed with the standard:

<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
  <!-- Do special_cat stuff... -->
<?php endwhile;?>

or something along those lines.

Okay, description done. Now for the practicalities:

2. There's a bunch of them. posts_where, posts_join, posts_orderby
etc. Browse WP_Query::get_posts() in classes.php.

1. I don't know how fast it is, but you can do it with ORDER BY RAND().

This seems to work:

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Random Posts
*/

function query_random_posts($query) {
	return query_posts($query . '&random=true');	
}

class RandomPosts {
	function orderby($orderby) {
		if ( get_query_var('random') == 'true' )
			return "RAND()";
		else
			return $orderby;
	}
	function register_query_var($vars) {
		$vars[] = 'random';
		return $vars;
	}
}
add_filter( 'posts_orderby', array('RandomPosts', 'orderby') );
add_filter( 'query_vars', array('RandomPosts', 'register_query_var') );
?>

Hi Podz,

I did try and it doesn't work if you try a pingback and a trackback in 
the same post.  If you do only the pingback comes through.  I tried 
this with your Test blog with the same results.

My test blog is also still available for anyone wanting to test.

How can I identify if my server runs php as cgi?  I think it is just 
time to find a server that does not do this.

OK, I may have found something.  Multiple pings will work fine but a 
trackback will only work if it is alone.  Two or more trackbacks in one 
post causes the first to go out but all others fail.  A trackback and a 
pingback causes the trackback to fail.  I have not tried multiple 
pingbacks with a trackback yet but will upon my return.

That looks like a very interesting piece of code. The idea of parsing 
syndicated forum new post announcements would work well with this.

Exactly, it is third party forum software I was referring to. Apologies 
if my initial mail seemed confusing. I appreciate that such a post may 
have been better directed to the forum development lists. However, I 
posted it here as I was interested to hear about the feasibility issue, 
and wp integration.

And you have hit the nail right on the head there. It would be purely 
for SEO purposes. The wp network is already a vast area of contextual 
information. I am interested in leveraging it, for the personal users 
benefit. It seems that the current model for information retrieval is

1. third party search engine
2. blog / forum post / specialist site

It would be interesting to see how the first point could be removed. It 
looks like wp is already making great developments into site 
association. (I dont fully understand how XFN works though).  If the 
information from point one was already contained with point two, then 
any search which used the wp XFN network would (I am supposing) provide 
search results with a greater relevance and context. I dont know, 
perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree with this one.

nail on head. x2.

Content duplicability is a concern. But then again, mailing lists often 
publish archives and that doesnt seem to be too much of a problem. I 
think the consent issue on the other hand is much more interesting. I am 
not sure if that could be overcome. This is why I tentatively suggested 
a check box for opt in. It doesnt really address the issue of a 
informative reply being put into a contextual framework on a site 
elsewhere that the author may not appreciate. To some extent though, 
that is what bloggers have been doing for some time now.

I do! I am a big fan of forum syndication. However, it does clog up my 
inbox.

That is interesting. I guess it comes down to an issue of signal to 
noise. I am interested in exploring the idea that instead of searching a 
noisy area - a forum of disparate posts, you search for the nearest 
relevant signal - an associated blog. It would be an inconvenience 
looking for something that no one you know has an interest in. But it 
would save me a lot of time, if my friend had already looked for that 
information. There seems to be a lot of talk about "whatever 2.0" and it 
appears that whatever is the most disruptive is the most applauded. 
Well, I think this could shake things up a bit. Again though, perhaps I 
am way off on this.

That is an excellent point, and one I will try to remember in future.

Thanks again to all for the replies.  I have learnt a lot, and find this 
field of computing fascinating. If anyone has anything to add on this, I 
look forward to the reply. If anyone ever fancies chatting about this or 
similar off list, then please do drop me a line.

Lastly, I just wanted to say thanks for the wp and bbpress development 
work. It is a fine example of open source software. I can find it hard 
to articulate my thoughts clearly, so I'd like to quote an author called 
Alice Walker. She was commenting on the times we live in. To me it 
perfectly sums up my feelings toward open source software, and people 
such as yourselves.

"Despite the pain I feel in honestly encountering the reality of life. I 
find it a wonderful time to be alive. This is because at no other time 
known to human beings has it been easier to give and receive energy, 
support and love from people never met, experiences never had."

What is the URL? Will there be access to the Administration Panel?

 From the command-line:

$ php
Content-type: text/html
X-Powered-By: PHP/4.3.10

If you have cPanel, more details will show up in the main panel.

An  issue  was raised about a month ago. There was an ambiguity which  in-
volved  URL  delimiters,  which were said to be either  spaces  or  commas
(these  lead  to yet another ambiguity). Which did you try? I can  vividly
recall doing a test with multiple blogs and posting about success with the
lastest nightly (at the time... January-ish).

This sounds as though the URL's are not properly separated.

My delimiter was a space.  I did not try a comma.

I will test with a comma and report back.

You should not use commas, the split is done on whitespace.

As an aside, please trim the text you're quoting to so people don't
have to scroll through hundreds of lines they've already read. Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] Checking if hock exists
Message-ID: <D99BCD5F-CDED-4340-BB52-12FD03A05C04@kouloumbris.com>

Hi all,

I was wondering if there is an easy way to check if an action exists  
before calling it. I'll give an example because I am sure not many of  
you have understand my query.

Since wp2.0.1 we can use the add_action('dbx_post_advance',  
'my_function'); instead of add_action('edit_form_advance',  
'my_function'); What I wan't is to check if dbx_post_advance exists  
before calling it or call edit_form_advance so my plugin will be  
compatible with both wp2.0 and wp.2.0.1.

Any Ideas, I've tried function_exists but it doesn't work since it's  
a hock no a function.

Can't you just add your function to both hooks? If the hook doesn't 
exist then it'll be added, just never executed. The Wordpress core has 
no way of knowing every single hook in every single file, so it just 
adds them "blindly".

Not currently.  The best thing you can do now is check against the WP  
version number, or maybe check for the existence of a function that  
was introduced in the same version that the hook you want was  
introduced.  I've proposed a function for checking for the existence  
of WP core hooks.  The idea has been given a relatively lukewarm  
reception.  If this is something the devs would put in, I'd gladly  
code it, as I am already up to my elbows in hooks with http:// 
wphooks.flatearth.org/

Leaving aside the issue of whether XSLT stylesheets for feeds is a good 
thing or not, there are plenty of other reasons to want various hooks.

For example, this would also be helpful for those of us putting ads into 
our feeds. I've been experimenting (unsuccessfully) with Yahoo Publisher 
Services and right now it requires modifying wp-rss and wp-atom files 
directly.

You must use a *space* to separate the Trackback URIs.  If you use  
commas, the Trackbacks will likely fail, because instead of "http:// 
site.com/cgi-bin/mt-tb.cgi/24" being pinged, "http://site.com/cgi-bin/ 
mt-tb.cgi/24," will be pinged, which will likely fail (at least,  
that's my reading of the code).

Could you share the modifications that they require so that we can  
figure out where the best place for hooks would be?

I've been testing on a PHP as CGI environment (Site 5) with the  
latest SVN as of the writing of this e-mail.

I wrote a series of posts each with one trackback and one pingback  
(to two different posts on a different server).

I had cases where:
- both worked
- only the pingback worked
- only the trackback worked

I did nothing different... and I would randomly get one of those  
results.  Of note:  I never could get it to happen that neither  
worked... at least one of them always worked.

I then did another test, with 4 pingbacks and one trackback.  3 of  
the 4 pingbacks went through, and the trackback did not go through.

Next, I did a test with 4 pingbacks (no trackbacks).  3 out of 4 made  
it through (different 3, though).  Repeat of the test yielded 2 out  
of 4 pingbacks making it through.

The posts' "pinged" column is acting strange... URIs that were  
successfully pinged are sometimes not showing up.

Post metadata is empty, even though some of the _pingme should still  
be there (as the pingbacks didn't go out properly).

I'm going to bed before I scratch my eyeballs out.  Hope this info  
helps someone.

I'd be careful with that.  My understanding of randomization in mysql
is that the performance is awful.  I haven't done it myself but that's

That's why I eventually gave up using application/rss+xml and switched 
to text/xml for RSS. Maybe it's time to do the same for Atom?

Noooo!

The mime type tells you it's Atom, that is a Good Thing. Atom is
designed for Atom clients, not HTML browsers. I've pinged the Atom
list asking if there are any known workarounds (using conneg would
probably be doable, but more trouble than its worth...)

The case with RSS 2.0 is slightly different, as it doesn't have a
registered mime type (if I remember correctly, application/rss+xml 
was briefly championed early on, but as the simple fork of RSS didn't
have a convincing spec it wasn't accepted by IANA). RSS 1.0 has
application/rdf+xml.

Cheers,
Danny.

Makes sense. I'd like to avoid sending Atom as text/xml if at all
possible. As you mentioned, this is less established for RSS and
indeed we do serve it as text/xml already.

For what its worth I captured screen shots of FeedBurner across PC and Mac
platforms (alas I haven't uploaded them yet).  The verdict of the testing
was (works = graphical content not raw tagged text):

url tested: http://feeds.feedburner.com/SoftwareOnlyExt

Mac
* FF 1.5 works
* Camino Current Version works
* Safari doesn't work -- it detects that its a feed and defaults to their
RSS view

PC
* IE 6 works

I never got to Opera.  Anyone ever looked at Feedburner in Opera?  And while
I cringe at suggesting something that doesn't work in Konquerer, if we want
to hit volume then duplicating the implementation scheme (but not
necessarily display) of FeedBurner will do that.

Right, this has been discussed on #wordpress and we think the best
solution would be to send application/atom+xml to clients with that in
their Accept string, and text/xml to everyone else. We also demand
that feed readers start sending an Accept header.

A quick survey was conducted as to which readers Accept
application/atom+xml. Sage, Akregator does, FeedDemon doesn't send
Accept at all. We need more people testing different clients.

A quick note: this won't break any feed readers. There are plenty of
people out there serving Atom as text/xml already so feed readers have
to support it. It's not the right thing to do, hence us demanding feed
readers start Accepting application/atom+xml, but we've no choice.

Incidentally, most browsers Accept */*, so we'd have to only send
application/atom+xml to those clients that _specifically_ Accept
application/atom+xml.

Right. Now we need an implementation.

A note for later really.

Discussion of "feed:" came up over on the Apple Syndication list [1] (carnage!)

Anyhow the problem most browsers have in not being able to hand the
URI of the feed over to a helper app was mentioned. E.g. you click on
a PDF link, Acrobat gets the data content but no reference to where it
came from.

Tim Bray pointed to Atom's construct which fills this hole:

<link rel="self" href="feed URI" />

But he mentioned something else I'd not heard before - using it in RSS
2.0 feeds. Suitably namespace-qualified, it's entirely valid, and it
might well prove useful - for example if Safari adds support.

Cheers,
Danny.

If I understand what you are asking then I think you need page
templates See http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_your_own_Page_Templates
for an overview.

This would have been better asked on the support forum.

Why I like this idea:

It shouldn't break things- Clients may care to ask for a specific 
mimetype, but in the end, they're likely to accept anything as long as 
it's XML-valid.  Readers that ask for the non-browser mimetypes will get 
them.

It lets us put browser-targetted content into the feeds- Now, since 
text/xml is served to browsers, we can put in the XSLT stuff that makes 
the feed prettier in some browsers.  (I still like my own solution, 
which is to not display the feed data at all, instead displaying 
two-frame frameset: A top frame with a "this is a feed, use a 
feedreader" notice, and the bottom frame with the actual blog home page 
in it.)

It should make proponents of feed mimetypes happy - Why?  Because it 
should promote the use of the correct mimetype for requesting feeds.

Indeed, Matt's other code (as seen in a pastebin) is even better, 
because it decides what feed format to present to a client based on the 
Accept request header and not the request URI.  So if your client likes 
Atom best, it would request from http://example.com/feed and get Atom. 
A different client could point at the same URI and get RSS 2.0 or RDF, 
depending on the q of the Accept.  Very nifty.

If interested parties people could comment on why this might suck, that 
would be useful.  Really, I think this is pretty neat.

+1 on that whole idea, much better than the styling feeds bull.

+1 I love this idea, but I'm not entirely sure how well it'll work,
but its worth a shot while in testing to gather feedback, and if no
major problems arise, I'd definately encourage this as a 2.1 feature.

That would go right in-line with the idea (from the other thread) or 
using an open source rss library for output parsing.

If what you return varies based on the Accept header, then your response 
needs to include a "Vary: Accept" header, so that a cache with one 
version doesn't return it to something which would get the other 
version. At which point, from what I've heard, most caches will just 
punt and not cache it at all, rather than worry about handling the Vary.

And since the purpose of mime-types is to tell general-purpose user 
agents how to handle or dispatch an unusual content type, and you know 
that the general-purpose user agents aren't going to add 
application/atom+xml to their Accept header even if they know how to 
dispatch it, while the specific-purpose user agents that will add it 
will do the exact same thing no matter what type you return (possibly 
short of text/html), why bother? If you would rather work around browser 
bugs than work with the architecture of the web, just embrace that 
desire, and send application/xml (please, not text/xml, which has a rare 
but still very real risk of arriving misencoded) to everything. Caching 
(and minimizing the amount of processing required to generate a feed) is 
vastly more valuable than sending the correct mime-type only to things 
that you know will ignore it.

This header is trivial to add.

Do you disagree that clients should be requesting the proper content 
types in their Accept header for the content that they intend to 
receive?  Are you really saying that this is useless because clients 
will never adopt the content type recommendations that feed pundits espouse?

If a browser client prefers text/html or text/xml, and that content type 
is available, shouldn't we serve that instead of application/xml or 
application/atom+xml that they didn't specifically request?  As far as I 
see, there is plenty of latitude to assume that the request is going to 
be one rendered by a browser unless requested with a specific content type.

Why should we bother?  Because if you return a content type that 
browsers can display to browsers that prefer it, then the browser will 
also be able to render it in addition to whatever other clients request 
it.  Not doing this gets us nothing.  Doing this makes the content at 
the other end of feeds appear more friendly, which has yet to be 
demonstrated to harm anyone.

And regarding caching - How does the content type affect caching at all 
beyond the small change to add the Vary header?

We spent a good bit of time thinking about, discussing, and coding this 
solution.  It's going to take more of an explanation than saying "why 
bother?" and complete lack of an alternative to convince me that this 
isn't worth doing.

Just in case we might be chasing the wrong thing:

WordPress prevents duplicate trackback/pingbacks. If there is already a 
*back on that post from the same URL the second will be discarded.

Could you make a patch for this on Trac for inclusion in 2.1? I like 
this idea. If there are any other areas where RSS 2.0 is unusably vague 
or has a hole like this, including an atom element in addition might 
help smart aggregators. (And would be ignored by others, so doesn't hurt 
anything.)

The google RSS adsense plugin I wrote requires no modifications.

I didn't even use the right hook there. :)

For the sake of making help possible, let's start listing URLs in
these bug reports.

Blog URL
Post URL
List of included href URLs (pingbacks)
List of included trackback URLs

It makes a difference.

Thanks,

Subject: [wp-hackers] MT import issue -- should I raise an issue in Trac?
Message-ID: <43DECD42.8070207@myelin.co.nz>

Just imported a couple of COREblog blogs (Zope blogging package that 
outputs the MT export format) into WP 2.0.  It mostly went well - way 
easier than with 1.6 - but:

- the second step only seemed to ever import about 20 posts at a time.  
However, it didn't say that this was intentional - just stopped 
outputting after a bunch of "Imported post XXX".  Reloading the page 
would get it to do another 20, until finished.

- when there were no more posts to import, it printed the following 
error before "All done.  Have fun!":

*    Warning*: implode(): Bad arguments. in 
*/var/www/blog/wp-admin/import/mt.php* on line *79

Is this a known issue, or should I raise it in Trac?

Cheers,
Phil

btw - section 3.1 - I think the ATAG document is suggesting a preview 
mode that renders HTML like Lynx does, i.e. one that displays 
alternative content INSTEAD of the primary content.  There's no 
contraction here - this is not your usual preview mode, it's a *second* 
preview mode that shows how your HTML will appear to users who can't 
view images, etc.

I  think that would miss the point of incorporating previews entirely.  If
the  developer  wishes to make content more accessible, there  are  better
auxiliary  tools that are not bound to WordPress and in no way cripple the
newbie.

Many users of WordPress needed to make pages/posts public prematurely. The
preview  part,  which can be bandwidth- and CPU-consuming is  intended  to
avoid  that.  In 2.0 custom stylesheets are included too, which is  excel-
lent.

A good point was made by Joe with regards to IE's handling of alt. Writing
valid  XHTML in S5, for example, makes presentations terribly messy.  This
should  be treated as a design bug, not a behaviour to be taken for grant-
ed.  Overall,  I  very much like Joe's appraisal, so it ought to  be  read
carefully and thoroughly.

For my tests, I used a new post each time, so it wasn't an issue of  
duplicates.

Do you think it would help if we opened up multiple iframes and did  
one thing per iframe?  It seems to cause problems when more than one  
thing is thrown into one run.

The bug only affects some server setups, not others. We should find
the problem's cause before we start implementing solutions.

To accomplish this, the people experiencing this problem should make
their systems available for dev inspection and bugfixing. I was only
able to discover the CGI problem by logging onto makemead's server,
for example.

Email me off-list to coordinate this.

I just tested on Mark Jaquith's server by publishing a post with two
pingbacks and two trackbacks to a server of my own. I watched the
access log as I published the post and I saw each and every pingback
and trackback get processed.

The apparent reason for the difficulties is that the testers were
pinging/trackbacking a single blog and looking for the results to
appear in comments on the targeted posts. That's not a valid test
because WordPress has flood protection. It won't let the same person
post a comment twice in a short span of time.

Test again with your trackbacks/pingbacks targeted at different blogs
and then report success or failure.

Thanks.

OK, then trackbacks must carry more weight than pingbacks as they are 
more important.  I'd rather a pingback were discarded and the trackback 
sent 100% of the time.

That's fine but as I said in the previous email it is the trackback 
that is getting dumped.  I'd rather have the trackback work and the 
pingback suppressed.  This makes much more sense since you have to 
purposely put the trackback in it's form field while the pingback is 
simply a part of the post.

Interesting. On a side note, has Google now changed its policies so ads 
can be placed in feeds? Last I checked that was forbidden, but I assumed 
they'd change it eventually.

I can agree with that.

Most if not all of the mail functions can be overridden in a plugin,

True, but it would be nicer if there were filters in there. I had the

Yes, RAND is awful for ORDER BY.

http://jan.kneschke.de/projects/mysql/order-by-rand/

At the end, he shows times for 100, 1000, ... , 1M records.  RAND starts to 
'hurt' even when just 1000 records.  He walks through building an alternate 
approach, still in SQL (though using sub-selects, so MySQL 4.1+).

Do you need a completely random entry from the entire data set?  Or would a 
random-but-recent entry work? (i.e., select post_id limit 100, pick a random 
entry or entries, then do the 'full' query with post_id in {list of selected 
ids}...)

Looks like "matt" doesn't agree.  He closed the trac and set it to 
"wontfix".

Very disappointing.

Because you are of the opinion that trackbacks are more important than
pingbacks? You didn't back that up with anything. As Matt said,
pingbacks are better. What's wrong with preferring them?

If you want, write a plugin that switches it around.

I backed it up with the fact that trackbacks are purposely added while 
pingbacks are simply a part of the post.  Pingbacks also can be turned 
off.  I just don't see why they are preferred.

I suppose this is never going to get fixed then?

Thanks for your time.
