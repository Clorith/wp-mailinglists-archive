Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin translations
Message-ID: <642BF965-7344-4ACE-A39F-5B609232E177@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

How do plugin translations and translate.wordpress.org work?

Should I be doing what I have been doing and including the .po and .mo files with my plugin or should I be expecting people to download them themselves from the translate.wordpress.org website?

Also some translations are categorised as waiting and have been for over a year! Is there anything I can do to speed up the approval?

Thanks,
Daniel

Hi Daniel,

Once a translation is available through translate.wordpress.org <http://translate.wordpress.org/>, you no longer need to bundle it in your plugin. 

People do not have to download the translations manually, WordPress core actually detects and installs translations automatically.

Translations have to be approved by a translation editor, I think. You can request for the polyglots team to make some of your translators editors, if you trust their translation ability. See https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/12/06/plugin-translations-for-all-plugins/ <https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/12/06/plugin-translations-for-all-plugins/>

Subject: [wp-hackers] Setting the wp_users.deleted flag
Message-ID: <CAPdxqKmyBFNcbVQZvvO7NKToFEhTXe1Jsj=ZdhL4e_wvsuA44w@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to understand how the wp_users.deleted column is used by core.
It looks like it only exists for multisite installs, but wpmu_delete_user()
doesn't use it (it will delete the row and associated metadata).
get_user_by() doesn't take it into account, either. If I turn that flag on
for a user, their row gets highlighted in the Network > Users table, but I
don't see a way to get that state without updating the DB by hand.

This is mostly just curiosity as I couldn't find any documentation on it
other than that it exists.

Hey there.

I love MediaWiki and have been using it everywhere for years. Recently
I've been doing some rather major documentation and I realised there
were two features which would be really handy for me (if these or
similar already exist I would love to know!):

1. For links to articles in sections on the same page it would be really
handy if we had syntax like: [[#unity|]] which would auto-complete to
[[#unity|unity]] for you.

2. For duplicated content it would be handy if you could define a bunch
of "variables" down the bottom of a page and then reference them from
elsewhere. I am aware of templates, but those are overkill and difficult
to maintain per my use case (my use case is documenting the "purpose" of
a computer, I duplicate this in various places, but don't want to
maintain templates for that).

Since I'm here, quick thanks to the MediaWiki community for creating
such wonderful wiki software!

Regards,
John Elliot V

Hi John,

This list is actually for WordPress developers, but we do use MediawWiki for the docs on the WP Codex, so that's probably where things got confusing. :-) These sound like good ideas though, and things that would have been useful in our own docs, which I've contributed to quite a bit.

I'm not familiar with the MediaWiki mailing lists (if there are any), so I'm afraid I don't know where to direct you from here. Good luck on getting in touch with them though, and hopefully they'll use your suggestions.

-J.D.

Heya J.D.

Oh my! Imagine making that mistake! :)

Thanks, I'll see if I can track down the right list for my suggestions...

And, well, since I'm here, I've been using WordPress for years too, so
thanks to the WordPress community for creating such wonderful blogging
software! :)

Regards,
John Elliot V
