Sure, but this is sounding a bit like a broken record. We've had a
discussion, right back in July last year, about how parameters should
be passed. We decided URL format is okay, but the associative array
format discussed is better. Reference [1] outlines the problem and
solution pretty well.

[1]: http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/hackers/2004-July/000901.html

By the way, URL-style and associate array-style parameters are
compatible, if Owen Winkler's fix_params() function is applied:

function fix_params($params, $defaults = array())
{
	if(!is_array($params)) {
		parse_str($params, $ary);
		return array_merge($defaults, $ary);
	}
	return array_merge($defaults, $params);
}

The problem right now is that clicking "Plugins" gets me this:
"Couldn't open plugins directory or there are no plugins available."

Any advice appreciated

Looks strange to me. Why do you have to create a DSN? Can't you connect to MySQL the usual way? I've had numerous installs on Windows/IIS5 with PHP4/MySQL4 and haven't had any problems since March last year.

And yes, you can't CHMOD on Windows/IIS. You need to have to ask for write permission from the webhost. Besides, mail() function isn't enabled on Windows/IIS, I doubt it can work normally. I read somewhere that it needs to be worked around. Besides, doesn't WP has an option to use SMTP if mail() is not available? I think if its not available, then it should be, as some guys do install WP on Windows/IIS.

And your fopen, fread, fwrite etc. are disabled as noted in your phpinfo() output, I think that WP uses fopen/fread to load the plugins, so that's why you are not able to open the plugins directory.

No, WP does not have an option to use an alternative to mail(), and thus a 
few weeks back I ran into trouble installing it because I purposely left out 
mail support in PHP. It would be nice if it were wrappered in if function 
exists statements and if not, it tried to use an SMTP connection or one of 
the PEAR classes that does mailing.

Exactly. Most PHP software supports the use of an SMTP server, which
makes things rather handy in the case that you disable mail support in
PHP (like what you did Robert). SMTP support should be included in the
1.5.1 release, it's just one of those things that's just about necessary.

This should be on the must have list for the next release, its not that difficult to implement. A function to send mail can be created, like wp_mail() which will accept headers, etc. which the mail() function accepts & this new function will check if the mail() function is available or if the user has set the option to use smtp in the config file. It'll then send mail through the mail() function or through smtp, accordingly.

using a PEAR class would be overkill I'd say!! besides not everyone has PEAR, I haven't got it installed, I don't use it, but use some PEAR classes by directly including them in my apps. Maybe Ryan can answer this topic, if he's around & reading this, Matt is not around, that we all know.

There are a number of php mail classes that will perform SMTP auth and
what not.  There's the PEAR stuff, phpmailer, etc.  We need to audition
them and pick one that is light and license compatible with WP.  Then we
need to add settings to the UI, add the options to the db, and so forth.
This is not 1.5.1 material.  For 1.5.1, we can wrap wp_mail() with
function_exists() so that it can be replaced.  Someone can then write a
plugin.  The plugin could be proving ground for an eventual integrated
solution.

I have been using the PHPMailer classes for a while, and they do a decent 
job.  I had to change my settings recently as my new box no longer supports 
SMTP sending from a script, but DID support the mail function.

The problem I've had of late is the number of different PHP configs.  No 
socket functions vs fsockopen vs fopen-url have plagued my xml parser code, 
and I'm sure similar things will happen with a mailer implementation.  Would 
be good if there was a staged/stepped fallback system, so if mail() is 
turned off try X, and if X is based on something not active try Y... etc. 
With PHPMailer, at least you can call one function on the mail object to 
tell it what method you want to use -- lord knows that autodetection isn't a 
simple process (sockets could 'work', but SMTP connection might fail to send 
due to restrictions...).

ok, maybe this is not the v1.5.1 stuff if you plan to use a pre-made class for this, but yes, a patch with a function_exists() would be welcome so that it can plug the problem that came up with podz & give a message that WP won't be able to send any emails due to mail() function not available.

besides, I wasn't thinking about the UI in the admin panel for this. I just thought that for now we can do with some config in the wp-config.php in CONSTANTS storing the SMTP info & the user's wish to use SMTP or mail().

Message-ID: <a491f91d0504021733799dd070@mail.gmail.com>

While thinking about how to go about developing a theme, I thought it would 
be neat to add a whole host of features, some of which would only be 
available as plugins since you can't really do actions and filters from 
regular files, depending on where you want to do the actions or filters. So, 
I was thinking, what if there was a designated file in the theme directory 
to be loaded as a plugin? This way, theme developers wouldn't have to ask 
users to install and enable plugins, but rather just bundle them up with the 
theme, and it could be a "feature" that the theme comes with. Any thoughts 
on this?

It seems to me that you could just package plugins
with themes (in your zip or whatever), and then ask
the user to activate them. That way, you wouldn't need
to change anything about wordpress - and you'd still
have the same benefit.

wpPHPMailer is just about the first plugin I wrote for WP, back in
June 2004.  As the name suggests, it wraps the PHPMailer package. 
Until just recently (as part of my 7 days of plugins), I haven't made
any changes to it since Aug 2004 and haven't had any complaints since.
 As for the recent changes, I now store the options in the database
and I added an admin options page for the plugin (which it has sorely
needed and has been why I haven't piped up about it during recent SMTP
mail discussions).  But it's there now, so it may be worth taking a
look at as SMTP mailers are evaluated.

Also, the bare minimum PHPMailer files run ~80k (and are included in
the plugin's zipfile).  PHPMailer is GPL'd and used by a lot of PHP
projects (including Mantis).

Since you mentioned it, WP doesn't currently support plugins
overriding core functions even if those core functions are wrapped in
function_exists(), correct?  I know the intent is for plugins to be
able to do that, but how?  Plugins aren't sourced until after all core
files have been sourced, which is too late.  Or am I missing
something?

Or we could bundle a little shell script with WordPress that installs
a theme. It would do something like:

1. Extract theme from archive (JAR format? It's portable) into a
temporary directory
2. See if there's a 'plugins-deps' directory inside the theme archive
3. If so, move all the files in the plugins-deps directory to wp-content/plugins
4. Copy the rest of the files into wp-content/themes/<theme-name>.

Any thoughts on...

http://www.procata.com/blog/archives/2005/03/31/the-usability-of-input-filtering/

It's a nice article and it lists some problems. I guess his 'Filter
with Confirmation and Warning' sounds like the best solution: rather
than throwing the user input back in the users face with 'Not good
enough' (input validation), we help out and try to find some middle
ground. My thoughts are that if we show the original and filtered
versions, along with a warning that some bits might have changed,
along with highlighting in the filtered version to show exactly what
has changed, everyone's pretty happy.

I'll work a bit on an implementation.

In http://codex.wordpress.org/Submitting_Bugs, the section on reporting
"product build" mentions: "If you are testing a nightly, copy and paste the
version string found in the footer of any Admin screen. If you are using a
Subversion release, enter the revision number."

Not knowing anything about how the build system works, is it possible to
store this information in an accessible variable? Being able to use
something like bloginfo('product_build') would be really handy for a plugin
I'm working on.

Thanks,
Stewart

bloginfo('version') should be what you're looking for. If in doubt, go

It was brought up a while ago that each theme folder have a plugins

default/header.php
default/plugins/time-since.php

And that after determining what theme was being used, plugins would be 
loaded from that theme's plugin folder. I personally like that option

Well, we would have to leave it up to the theme authors to go in and prefix 
everything with my_theme or something similar.In the end, something like 
Jeff's solution or even one file that could be set aside to be loaded as a 
plugin would be an excellent idea. Shell scripting has too many 
possibilities for failure.

1. The server is a windows server
2. PHP is running in safe mode
3. Users still have to chmod stuff to get everything to work properly
4. It brings up potential secuirty issues, some of which might get WordPress 
banned from some hosting companies.

bloginfo('version') on an SVN build wouldn't tell you the revision number, 
nor would any variable in the source. You would likely have to simply 
execute svn status to get the revision number.

Well, currently the only option for such a thing would be a. using the 
advanced cache plugin interface or b. asking users to include your plugin 
early on in wp-settings.php

Here's an approach I've been mulling over.

Add a preload_file action to be called from plugin files.  This allows
plugin files to specify a file to be loaded before the core WP
includes.  In the plugin:

function test_plugin_preload_file() {
   preload_file(dirname(__FILE__). '/test_preload.php');
}

add_action('preload_file', 'test_plugin_preload_file');

preload_file() runs plugin_basename() on the supplied file and adds it
to a 'preload' array in the options DB.

In plugins.php, we call the preload_file action whenever a plugin is
activated.  This is a bit tricky.  First we'll have to unset all
existing preload actions and then include the just activated plugin.
Then we call the preload_file action.  This is the only situation where
the preload_file action is called.

In wp-settings.php, we loop through the list of preloaded files after
wp-db.php is included but before functions.php is included.  Since
functions.php is not yet included, we have to be careful not to call
get_option() to retrieve the preload array etc.  Only wpdb may be used.

Thoughts?

I am using a master file, in my case cjd_master_control.php that
includes plugins located in /theme/plugins/ after an if!exist is
performed.

If the function is not found it includes the plugin from the theme
folder, if it is found it doesn't and everything still works as
advertised.

Seems pretty simple to me, and I have found no performance hit as yet.

For a variety of reasons, I'm not going to support any of my plugins 
that are not installed as per my own installation instructions.  And 
end-user will have to contact the theme author for support of plugins 
that I wrote that are somehow installed with a theme.  Should I provide 
an upgrade to a plugin that came with a theme, users can figure out how 
to install it without my help or simply not have the bug-fixes or 
additional functionality.  I just don't have time to debug your themes, too.

What I'm taking away from this discussion is basically a flagrant 
disregard on the part of some theme developers for the efforts of the 
plugin authors whose plugins they employ.  Provide documentation for 
your theme on how to get the latest, hopefully most bug-free version of 
the plugin that your theme requires, and recognize the people whose work 
you're using.  Knowing that a theme could so easily take credit (by 
denying or obscuring the credit that the plugin comes with by default) 
for the hard work of a plugin developer by so surreptitiously including 
and mangling the whole plugin distribution makes me ill.

I realize that this plugin/theme combo thing can still be an issue for 
the end user, and since I'm in that crazy "put up or shut up" group 
where you can't complain without offering a concrete solution, here's my 
offering:

I've attached a core patch that will let theme developers add multiple 
"Requires:" header lines to themes.  This will allow WordPress to 
display what plugins are required for that theme and detect whether a 
function from that plugin (thus, the whole plugin) is available.  The 
format of the header line is:

Requires: function_name plugin_url description

Only the description parameter can include spaces.  If this header item 
is present in the theme, then WordPress will display the description 
field for every "Requires" entry in the header with a link to the 
specified plugin page.  It will also display either [not detected] or 
[present] depending on whether the function is_callable.  You can 
specify plugin static class methods using the :: operator in the 
function name, such as "MyClass::MyFunction".

Note that this alteration will not prevent a theme from being activated 
for any reason.

It may be useful to add some CSS styles to the div that I added for 
displaying requirements in the admin.css file, just to make it look 
pretty.  The div is classed as "requirements".  The code is also not 
very fancy, and needs localization for the output strings.

This solution may also alleviate a previously mentioned issue of 
customized themes using new plugins after they're altered.  Just add a 
new requirements line when you alter the theme to remember what your 
theme requires.

Please take a minute to consider what including plugin code with a theme 
denies the plugin authors - the only real incentive for their work, credit.

This is a great idea as it would allow us to continue the separation of 
theme/plugin directories. However...

You're totally correct. By packageing plugins within a theme, the theme 
author is likely to recieve credit for a plugins functionality unless 
they are very explicit in their declaration of who made what on the 
download page.



And I don't care. (And I make plugins, not themes)



This is not about ego boosting plugin authors; the solution of bundling 
plugins with themes is focused on the end user experience. One of the 
overriding goals of WP as a product is that it's easy to use *for 
anyone*. Allowing themes to package various plugins would allow theme 
authors to take advantage of a lot of extra WP features, while still 
making the process of using that theme very easy for the end user (at 
any technical level).

Your proposition, however, has users getting a theme, reading a bunch of 
technical info and bouncing from site to site to get the various things 
they'd need and in the end quite possibly saying, "Fuck it" and going 
back to Kubrick because it was "click and work".

*My* incentive for producing plugins is to give back to the WP community 
which has given me so much.

Well, my original intention with this was not for bundling other plugin 
author's work, but instead having a place that would function like a plugin 
so that theme authors could include some of their own special features that 
could only be done in a plugin without requiring the end user to go through 
extra work installing the theme. In the end, I suppose that this feature 
could hurt some plugin authors since their work would probably be forgotten 
and just passed off as a feature of the theme whose author didn't give props 
to the people who helped. I guess in the end something like this would 
probably be a matter of personal preference to the WP developers.

How about splitting some of the bare necessities out of functions.php and 
into another file, so that we would have access to some of the functions 
that nobody should be changing anyways and that plugins would need 
(get_option, add_action, add_filter, etc.). This way, we don't lose some of 
the features that plugins can provide and still have the option to override 
most core functions. This could become a whole new major feature for 
whatever the next release is (dare I say 1.6, 1.7, or 1.8, who knows?). It 
could be called more of a "module" or "addon" instead of plugins, because it 
offers greater power over what happens everywhere.

get_alloptions() and some other functions call do_action() and
apply_filters().  If we call these before the plugins are loaded, no one
will be around to listen to those actions and filters.

We could have a set of preload-functions.php, but none of those
functions should invoke filters or actions.  Doing so would be useless.
Adding filters and actions would be okay.

Hmmm, we call get_settings() several times before loading plugins.
get_settings() calls get_alloptions() which retrieves all options and
does an apply_filters() on each.  Since plugins aren't loaded yet,
applying filters doesn't seem very useful.

I think we are seing past the obvious, I think we should add hooks in
the themes... Im rewriting all my plugins to use do_action and
apply_filters instead of special function calls...

for instance is my new Pages As Navigation plugin called like this
right now at my kubrick theme: (at http://www.rummanddan.dk/)

header.php
> <div id="menu">
>	<ul><?php do_action('rum_flat_menu', ''); ?></ul>
> </div>


The page plugins has subpages called like:
sidebar.php
> <?php /* wp_list_pages('title_li=<h2>Pages</h2>' ); */ ?>
> <?php do_action('rum_sub_pages', 'before=<li>&title=<h2>Sub pages</h2>&after=</li>'); ?>

This way the theme could have "integrated" the plugins allready if we
started to apply our own hooks the theme authors could start using...

I dont know if this is a good idea yet, but its functionality thats
build in allready and seems to work fine with the core hooks :)

The core_files_loaded hook in wp-settings.php seems similarly 
pointless.  I tried using it the other day, and scratched my head for a 
while after I finally discovered the reason why it wasn't working.

What bothers me about many posts I receive from this list (and is 
usually remedied by cooler-headed core contributors - thanks guys) is 
that there is a lot of shouting from a particular perspective without 
evaluating what anyone else's needs may be.

I certainly consider the user experience important, and I feel that the 
patch I've provided is a nice first step toward improving it, because it 
addresses the problem of dependencies both with a default theme install 
and with later user customizations.  I fully expect someone to come 
along and offer suggestions to improve or replace my idea so that we can 
arrive at a conclusion that will appease the most folks.

So I guess what I'm asking is, How would you allow plugin authors to 
maintain credit for their work while maximizing the user experience?  
Surely you don't think these are mutually exclusive?

I think this a very good approach to have more control from
plugins/modules whatever the should be called over core functions...

Similar your approach i have always wandered why there wasnt an
"activate" and "deactivate" hook for plugins... I always do it
manually :)

The feature that I want is the ability to run things that could only be run 
as plugins, not just special function calls. There are some limits to what 
you can do by the time it gets to the theming system. You also couldn't add 
configuration menus in the admin without being able to hook in earlier than 
themes

Well, what did you think of Matt's idea to add a special file to the 
themes that is included at the same time as plugins are?

I published a post earlier with no title. Noticed the error and went 
back to fix it. The permalink though reflects the post-id, not the title.
Doesn't bother me at all, but it might some. Is that the correct behaviour ?

No, but it's probably due to oversight than any bug.

If there is no title, there is no post slug, then how do you generate a 
Permalink? I imagine it uses the post-id for the post-slug then. Makes 
sense as it will allow non-titled published posts to work still.

But yeah, I would report this as a bug that post-slug should be updated 
if the title was blank and is then changed.

I'd rather that was done only if the entry hadn't been published yet. 
Otherwise links to the entry from other sites would break.

There's something weird going on here. Themes are for look and style, 
not functionality. No theme should require anything other than basic 
WordPress. Why are people even bothering to try to support themes that 
insist on including template tags and functions that may or may not 
exist on any given system?

Frankly, I don't see the point. Divorce style from functionality. Themes 
are for style, plugins are for functionality. If people want to make 
recommendations, or include CSS in their themes to style the output from 
specific plugins, fine, but code?

But you can't have functionality without building it into the style. If 
theme authors didn't include do_action statements, you wouldn't be able to 
add any functionality. The WordPress themes are not based around a template, 
and thus give you the greatest possible freedom, and a side-effect is that 
some theme developers, because they are ignorant of what happens behind the 
scenes, leave some things that are essential to add functionality out of 
their themes.

Plugin developers are having a hell of a time supporting their plugins now 
because theme developers leave actions out, mix everything around, and 
there's no longer a standard way of doing things. Thus, if we can resort to 
a combination of style and functionality, we no longer have to worry about 
it.

So it all goes back to the theme developers being ignorant. So why not 
give theme developers a guide based on
http://boren.nu/archives/2004/11/10/anatomy-of-a-wordpress-theme/
and a standard set of template tags that *should* be included for normal 
functionality.

Here's another off the wall bug just reported dealing with my plugin and 
somebody elses theme...

http://dev.wp-plugins.org/ticket/130

I can't say I can duplicate it because I use the default kubrick 
template on my sandbox which includes the wp_list_pages() template tag. 
See the mess we're in? Worst part is, its not just me. There are plenty 
of others experiencing the same things I am.

The behavior in 1.5.1 is to not set the post slug until the post is
published.  After publication, WP won't attempt to auto update the slug
if the title changes.  The only way to change the slug on a published
post is manually.

If a post has no title when it is published, the id is used.  After
publication, the same rule as before applies.  We will not automatically
change a post slug on a published post, even if the slug is the post id.

My point in this whole thread was not, as some people on IRC have taken it 
to be, a way for theme developers to bundle all the plugins they want with 
their theme and make it completely dependent on certain plugins. I should 
have never said the words "bundle" and "plugins" in the same sentence. 
Instead, I just wish there was a way for theme developers to have one file 
that is called at plugin time, that would simply do some of the add_action 
and add_filter that couldn't be done at the time that themes are loaded. My 
personal intention with this was going to be to provide some custom features 
and make a really cool theme that would be completely customizable via the 
wordpress administration interface, but I don't want to have to request that 
users install and activate a plugin at the same time. The other issues 
should probably be brought up in another thread.
Sorry Ryan, accidentally only replied to you, *curses reply-to: headers*

One more try, gmail sent it to the wrong hackers address. *wishes he could 
make it forget hackers@wordpress.org*

I don't see what's wrong with the theme developers just including the required plugins with thier theme. That way, nothing has to change about Wordpress itself, and theme developers might be encouraged to make sure thier themes are compatible with the default install - which is how it ought to be anyway.

The attached patch introduces activate/deactivate hooks.  preload_file()
can be called from the activation hook.  Here's the usage:

function test_activate() {
	echo "activate<br/>";
}

function test_deactivate() {
	echo "deactivate<br/>";
}

register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'test_activate');
register_deactivation_hook(__FILE__, 'test_deactivate');
?>

This may be a good idea for all sorts of reasons -- I haven't worked it 
all through in my head yet -- but I can't help but wonder, if you've got 
really good functionality in mind, why not make it a plugin to begin 
with? Then people who wanted the feature, but preferred to run another 
theme, could still have it.

I just really don't see the point of having themes-that-act-as-plugins. 
Have your theme, and if you've got a cool idea, have a plugin, too! That 
way everyone is happy. :)

Message-ID: <4250EAB2.5040800@webfroot.co.nz>

Hi all,

I need to write a cookie out at plugin load time, and the value of this 
cookie is related to the current post id and whether or not it's in 
comments display mode... $post doesn't exist at this time. :(

Any idea how to get this information at this time?

Cheers,

When I click on "write a new post" (at least in my checked out version) 
the id is auto-inserted in the post-slug-field. If I immediatly change 
to the advanced-edit-mode the post-slug will still be the id and not 
being replaced with whatever title I come up with when hitting 
"publish". Maybe Wordpress "thinks" that the post is already published 
while it is not?

That would be essentially what's happening. If we go with the
direction the thread has taken rather than with Robert Deaton's
initial intentions, then all we are discussing is a way to mark up
certain plugin dependencies for a theme (eg, theme X requires plugin
Y). That means if someone wanted to switch theme, they could just keep
the plugin and do so.

On the subject of giving plugin authors credit, how about doing this
within the admin section? So when a certain theme is activated, the
page displays a little box with 'This theme comes with these
plugins...' then a list of plugins with descriptions, links and
authors. Surely that'd be enough middle ground so that both plugin
developers would feel they're getting credit, and users don't have to
hop between websites with only a vague idea of what their trying to
download?

I wasn't able to reproduce that on latest SVN, but I /was/ able to 
reproduce on my main site, which is running SVN code from several weeks ago.

My best idea would be to add a hook in yourself, in
wp-blog-header.php. Search for 'query_posts', then in the next line,
add this:

do_action('post_query_posts');

Then you can hook onto this from inside your plugin:

function write_cookie() {
  //your code goes here
}

add_action('post_query_posts', 'write_cookie');

That won't be called as soon as your plugin is loaded, but it will be
executed as soon as $post is created.

global $id;

The setup_postdata() function in wp-includes/functions.php is a good
reference.

Nice. I've always been a fan of Google's Adsense: they're really
unobtrusive and it obviously go some way toward paying the bills.

This won't work. the_ID() is an echoing template tag, meaning that
it'll echo the ID rather than return it. What you want is Kimmo's
answer, using the global $id variable, or alternatively $post->ID
should be available as well.

Wouldn't you need to use ob_start etc. around the_ID() ?

Seriously, use $post->ID that is the fastest way to grab that.

Alternatively, we could move the dozen or so functions that we have
marked as replaceable into a separate file that is included after
plugins are loaded.

Well, to blow surprises out of the water, the theme I wanted this 
functionality for was one that was going to be a completely customizable via 
the admin interface, colors, sizes, images, everything. Obviously, this 
isn't possible with only a theme, but I thought asking a user to do both was 
a bit too much hassle. In the end, I think there are certain people here who 
aren't going to drop the idea of bundling plugins, so at this point, I give 
up, since I now realize that a lot of theme developers wouldn't give proper 
credit or would make themes reliant on plugins..

Then we only have plugins fighting amongst themselves over who defines 
the function first :)

At some point, maybe we should add some sort of "plugin load order" 
hints, similar to the filter/action priorities. Maybe with a "Plugin 
Priority: 5" marker. Right now, the only way to affect the load order is 
by modifying the filenames of the plugins, AFAIK. Granted, the load 
order *usually* isn't important, but I do actually have a couple of 
(homegrown) plugins that need to specifically be loaded first or last.

Whoever is first wins.  This is a problem in all approaches discussed
thus far.  You can't have two plugins trying to replace core functions.

Filename ordering works well enough for SysVInit.  S01, S02, S99, ...

Once upon a time, Morgan and I discussed having a Priority: field and
changing the active_plugins array to have priority levels, much like
wp_filters.

http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=765

I haven't cared enough to bother with it though.  Just naming the plugin
01-do-me-first.php has worked well enough.

wp_notify_moderator
get_currentuserinfo
get_userdata
get_userdatabylogin
wp_login
auth_redirect

And the function that started this discussion:

Preloadable doesn't make as much sense to me. What would be a better 
word for "over-ridable"? We could call them pony functions... ;)

I was thinking "replacable-functions.php" or "pluggable-functions.php".

I was trying to invoke the disgruntled spirit of LD_PRELOAD, the cause
for many an uttered curse.

pluggable-functions.php sounds good to me.

According to Michel, b2 did entity2ncr translation.  Should we integrate
the entity2ncr plugin linked to in bug 929?  Bug 1132 seems to handle
this by using CDATA.  Which way do we go George?

Two pingback bugs.  I haven't investigated yet.  Anyone else?

Nice try, but my 000-SpamForceField.php plugin already trumps that ;)

The ultimate "Must Load First" plugin, without using problematic 
characters, would probably just be named "+.php". But the uber-hackers 
could sneak in before that with " .php" (a space character). And 
super-elite mondo h4x0rz would probably try embedding a NUL or SOH 
control character in the filename.

I'll commit it tomorrow if there are no objections.  Please check over
the code.  I changed it to use str_replace() instead of preg_replace().
preg_replace() didn't seem necessary.  str_replace() is faster.

It would be even faster if we didn't loop over each, both arguments to 
str_replace can be arrays, though the array code won't be as pretty.

Subject: [wp-hackers] text domain different from 'default'
Message-ID: <42522D92.3060302@developer.bg>

Yesterday I started translating the internationalized default theme. 
However, when trying to deploy the .mo file I came across a serious 
problem. In order to add .mo file different from the default one I had 
to specify a different text domain under which the tranlation to be 
loaded. But when using another text domain all calls to the __()/_e() 
funcions should have the domain name as their second parameter. At first 
glance I cannot see an easy way to localize the kubrick theme (or any 
other theme/plugin) without adding a domain to the translation funcion 
calls.

Thanks for the help, David :)

Unfortunately, it seems like output has occured before this point :(

Any other ideas?

Yes.  A domain is necessary.  All themes and plugins that want to load
translations must specify a domain.

OK, we will add domain parameter to __()/_() calls in the theme.
However I see another problem. In many template functions there are 
internationalized strings. Any plugin or theme, which uses them will use 
the default domain translations, regardless of its will to use those 
translations.

Indeed.  Each domain has its own catalog.  Some projects like to use
several domains in order to make string lookup faster since the lookup
is bounded by catalog.  Separate domains are also useful when you want
to selectively load catalogs depending on context.  I've considered
putting all admin strings in a separate domain/catalog so that we
wouldn't have to load them during regular blog page loads.

I think it is a good solution. However a lot of code needs small, but 
expensive alternations. It would be nice to have this in 1.5.1  - the 
i18n version...

And the question how to handle template functions used in many 
themes/plugins using different domains is still open. Maybe a domain 
parameter should be added to template functions?

I have a plugin (Redirectify) that gets the Post ID when you would need 
it.  Redirectify redirects visitors to a different URL when they visit 
the single (comments-enabled) page with a "redirect" meta key in it.  In 
order to do this, the plugin must know the Post ID before content is 
sent so that the header can be set, otherwise that "Headers already 
written" error is thrown.

If you hook 'template_redirect' you can get the Post ID from $wp_query 
directly, like so:

add_action('template_redirect', 'foo_fn')
function foo_fn($nothing)
{
	global $wp_query;
	if(is_single() /* || is_page() */) {
		setcookie('lastpostid', $wp_query->post->ID);
	}
}

Outside the Loop, I don't think $post is reliable.

Try it.

A long time ago, I created my 'sideblock' functions to help abstract out the 
wrappering-style of items in a sidebar/menu.  Basically, the functions 
inserted the proper start and end tags, whether they were divs, ul/li, li/h2 
(Kubrick), etc.

Now, that's fine and dandy when I control the theme... ;)  But with the 
variety of themes out there, and plugin developers (like myself) trying to 
'attune' output to match themes properly, it would seem to be necessary for 
the themes to define either variables, functions, or both, that plugins can 
call to appropriately style certain types of elements.

At the start, even just styling of sidebar elements would be helpful.  In 
the long run, other main-content elements should be done as well.  It'd also 
be good if there was some consistency in 'main' blocks like 'content' and 
'post' and such things, and that any special class attribution (like 
Kubrick's "narrowcolumn", etc.) were also somehow declared in a 
variable/function.

Thoughts, comments, further brainstorming?  Kubrick isn't the only one that 
causes me difficulty, it just does the most total 'different' approaches 
that it makes sample code difficult. ;)  The worst of which is the use of 
the 'before:' CSS2 tag on the sidebar li's -- which I'm still trying to find 
the proper way to 'turn off' on li's I don't want prefixed... :)

I think this would be a great idea, but I highly doubt that this will ever 
come to be, with the huge amount of themes out there and the general lack of 
cooperation from theme developers. For example, I'd bet that >60% of the 
themes that are currently out do not have the hooks that they're asked to 
include in the codex on the theme development page. There could be great, 
easy to add things to help with cooperation between themes and plugins, but 
in the end I would bet that none of them will fully grab hold.

Starting new thread :)

Do you think that if a cooperative project to demonstrate the value of this 
would be beneficial?

What if a small group of peeps slammed their heads together to create a 
framework of some kind? Part of the theme development issue is one of maturity 
in terms of knowing WP and what it can do.

I'm currently looking for a project of some kind. I'd be willing to take an 
existing theme and template tag the living shit out of it, with the help of you 
folks, and create what is basically a wet dream template.

Is that even doable?

People have been doing it with forum themes for years now, and it's
been working great.

Well, maturity and professionality are certainly needed (when it comes
to Themes and support), and man would that look good, not only for
outsiders.

I know Firas has been working on a theme validation engine of sorts as far 
as the four actions that are in kubrick and the classic theme. Maybe we 
could even get a team of volunteers together and create a theme validation 
service, have a checklist of things theme authors must do to make sure their 
themes are compatible with the default WordPress themes. It'd likely be a 
daunting task with the amount of themes out now, but I know I'd be willing 
to donate part of my time to such a thing.

We could also stick with the automated checker idea, as that would offload 
work from human beings, although it might not be completely accurate all of 
the time, although its error ratio may in the end be lesser than that of 
humans. Thoughts?

:)

Well, the value of "this" is hard to say -- as you've introduced another 
project.  Yes, I think there's merit to creating 'theme templates' to build 
off of.

But my original point is that things like plugins, that want to output code 
matching the format of the current theme -- again, start with just adding 
sidebar elements -- have no way to do so.  An extra set of variables or 
functions would be nice.

The Presentation page itself could, in theory, have a 'validation' option 
that'd say whether or not certain hooks/functions/variables are defined that 
MUST be for proper integration overall, plus best-of-class support for 
dropping in plugins, etc.

While I think the idea is great, the whole getting theme developers to 
comply is an issue. I think it would be neat if we made it a feature of the 
next major release to have a validation service as part of the admin, where 
when a new theme is activated, after the first run we do a register shutdown 
function or even just run the checks in WP itself after the theme is loaded 
and check that the correct variables have been defined and the proper hooks 
have been added, and if one is found missing, a special setting in the 
database sets the theme to be unvalid, and then have the admin visibly let 
the user know that the theme they're running is invalid. This way, theme 
developers know that their themes aren't valid as they're developing them, 
and end users will be majorly discouraged from using invalid themes.

The validator would be fairly easy to write in most aspects. The hardest 
part is checking things like the comment form, which isn't there when the 
index is called, and if we were to check on a comment page, the sidebar may 
or may not be located there. We could have WordPress write an array of items 
reqiured to validate to the database, and only write the comment value on a 
comment page, and have the admin not say anything until the comment form is 
marked as missing. Then, to save load, we don't update the values every time 
the page is called, instead only when the values are missing. In the admin 
panel there could be a button to clear the current validation settings of a 
theme and have it recheck.

Just a thought... but without some measure to ensure that theme authors are 
following guidelines, I don't think we'd get far at all.

Truly, I'm less worried about compliance, and more concerned that the new features are added, and that the included/default themes provide the proper groundwork.  I'm having to teach people how to hack up things to look right for Kubrick, so let's get THAT updated first with this concept of variables/functions to provide style info to plugins. ;)

There are only a few things needed.  <?php wp_head(); ?> and <?php 
wp_meta(); ?> and <?php wp_footer(); ?> and
<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?> are the essential ones, 
right?  DrDave's Spam Karma 2 already has code that checks the comments 
files for the "comment_form" action, and Firas' one should do that as 
well as the others.  The only other guidelines I can think of are 
general CSS standards that we could try to promote.  Like, surrounding 
posts with <div class="post" id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>"></div> and 
making entry titles <h2> .  But I'd think that having those 4 hooks 
would be the greatest thing to make plugins work across themes.

Message-ID: <42539706.4070506@cornell.edu>

As far as I know, the trackback form doesn't verify that the trackback 
URL resolves to the host IP sending the trackback, which in my opinion 
and experience, is the cause of most or all of the trackback spam 
currently getting posted.  I know that in theory trackback can be send 
by a server of behalf of someone else, but I know of very few 
implementations that work that way.

Another good thing to do is to check the sending URI to see if there is 
a link to the TBed page.  I know it isn't technically required, but a 
lot of people consider it to be a form of "quasi-spamming" when other 
bloggers Trackback without linking.  Spam Karma 2 currently does that 
check, but the IP check might be just as effective.

And the question must be asked, why do I need the header and footer
functions?  Why must I use a seperate header and footer file for my
theme?

"I think for some themes it would be a waste of time, so who has
decided what I must use in my theme?"

This is not necessarily my opinion on this matter, but I think that
people are getting a little too jolly with "let's enforce a standard
for how Tom Follery must create his theme."

Just a thought.

Oh and please don't get me started on CSS standards, I am sorry but no
one will tell me how to structure and deploy my CSS.

That is my choice, and should never be brought into consideration when
talking about creating themes.

No, you put wp_header( ) and wp_footer() *somewhere*. Index.php will do.

For example, many themes break wp-cc because I hook into wp_footer to 
output the creativecommons.org image.

wp_header() is usually there in every theme so it's not really a concern.

The comment_form is inherited from the default theme if there is no 
comments.php so that's not really a requirement. I think that's true of 
wp_meta() in sidebar.php too.

Anyway, it's a complex interaction of functions and whatnot, which is 
why I was writing a parsing validator.

There are many people who use blogging clients (w.bloggar, ecto, zempt, 
etc) which are capable of sending trackbacks on their own. In that case, 
the IP of the client won't match the IP of the blog. I would hesitate to 
flag a trackback as 'spam' purely on the basis of an IP mismatch. But 
moving it to moderation could be prudent.

I'm not proposing enforcing a standard, I would simply want to have 
standards that I can point to and say, "My plugin doesn't work because 
your theme doesn't abide by these standards."

I don't really care how lousy the theme PHP/HTML/CSS is as long as I 
don't have to debug it to make my plugins work.

I agree and disagree -- but that's a separate topic.  However, your 
sentiment reinforces my ORIGINAL point for this discussion:

Wouldn't it be great that you could deploy your CSS in your theme however 
you want, and then via variables/functions tell any/all plugins a little bit 
about how your theme DOES use divs/h2s/classes/whatever so they can 
dynamically output HTML that >matches< the look and feel of the rest of your 
theme/CSS?  That's what I'm driving for.

If you've seen the default phpBB smilies, then you'll notice that both are same. I guess they both are from the same place, phpBB. Or am I wrong? ;)
& phpBB is under GPL

infact, I've seen quite a many softwares using these smilies!! :)

deleting a user at the moment also deletes all his posts. can it be worked around? I mean, can the posts be prevented from deletion while the user is deleted?

Subject: [wp-hackers] binding a user to a category
Message-ID: <000f01c53adb$1fa59000$4d20010a@a1>

does anyone know of a hack/plugin for WP1.5 which allows a non-admin user, say a user below level 5, to be bound to some categories.

For example, I've categories A, B, C & D on my blog. I've a user XYZ whom I want to bind to categories A & B so that he can post to those categories only & not to any other.

This feature is not there in WordPress. Does anyone know of a hack or a plugin(I'm doubtful about the plugin, its not possible with current hooks, or is it?)

this can be considered to be put in WP, its useful for blogs authored by many users & the admin may want to bind some users to some particular categories.

You could hook in to "publish_post" and "edit_post" actions and do the 
category restriction then.

You can start from my Limit Categories plugin, which limits all users 
under a certain level to posting in predefined categories.  It would be 
a short step to specify restrictions by individual users - in fact, 
somewhat had told me they made these customizations for their own site.

You must do all of the configuration in the plugin file currently, since 
I had anticipated some user profile extensions (metadata for user 
accounts) that never came to pass.

The Limit Categories plugin is here:

that might do it but I was thinking of only displaying the categories which the user has access to, so that all his posts get published

sure I can but that plugin restricts users below certain level to some group of categories. but I want each user to be bound to some specific categories. so the binding criteria is the user, not the user level.

I guess I'll look into your plugin & see if I can modify it to my needs.

BTW, sorry to those people who received my first email on this topic twice, I dunno why that happened!!

First move all the posts to another user and then safely delete him/her 
from userlist. Moving could be tough if both there are many posts of 
this user and you do not to interact directly with the database ;)

So here are two ways of moving posts from user to user.

Numbr one.Go to Manage->Posts and for each post of this user change the 
owner to the user of your preference. No, I do not know how to do this 
with the 500 post of the user :)

The second way of moving - in a mysql console execute:
UPDATE <db prefix>_posts SET post_author=<id of the move-to user> WHERE 
post_author=<id of the to-be-deleted user>.

You can get user ids from the Users section in the administration.

ah!! I should've made myself more clearer, no?
I know of these two methods, ie., via admin panel & MySQL. what I was asking is that I don't want to use any of these things, essentially, move the posts to another user.
I've a blog setup for someone who's not techy & has about 100-150 posts of a user he wants to delete. Now doing it through admin panel is out-of-question. And he can't do it via MySQL too. I can create a script for him to do that ofcourse, but does the posts really need to be assigned to another user? I mean he wants to keep the attribution of the posts to the original author, but don't want him to post again.

As I know of it(correct me if I'm wrong), a 0 level user can't post, right? So this can be overcome by simply making the author a 0 level user, which will stop him from posting but also keep his posts with proper attribution. Now the problem will arise when the number of such 0 level users increase. 1,2,3,4,5... its ok, but if they reach somewhere 50-60 or above, its gonna be messed up!!

so a solution should be there!! I mean there should be an option which allows the posts to remain with proper attribution while the user can be deleted.

Reducing to level 0 sounds like the perfect solution.  What's the 
problem with 50-60 deactivated users?  I've run installs with 3 times 
that many.

yeah, that may not seem like a problem, but I think its a problem. :)
The thing is that over a period of time, these Level-0 users will increase, un-necessary records in the DB that's of no use to anyone. :)

so a solution must be there. if any of the devs agree with me, then I would suggest that this feature to be introduced in WP.
is anyone listening? Ryan? Matt? Alex? Michel?

I am more inclined to think that should we have an option to *hide*
the level-0 users. After all the space taken by them is negligible.

If you want to delete them you are back to the problem of their posts.
How or where to store the attribution? There is nowhere to do that if
you delete the record to which they relate.

Why? If we're feature-adding, we might as well go the extra mile and
add functionality to deal with the real problem, rather than adding
functionality to make what is essentially a hack work a bit better.

How about a page entilted 'Delete user' that says something along the
lines of 'Deleting a user won't delete the posts authored by that
user, so please select another user to attribute those posts to'?

I understood that the reason the posts disappeared if the author did was 
because the posts were owned by the author. Surely re-assigning a post 
is a bad thing for a whole pile of reasons ?
How would that fit with any licence ?

correct. I agree, we might do the thing right rather than just patching up. :)

no, that would essentially be the same thing as "Nikolay Bachiyski" suggested
doing via Admin Panel or through MySQL in the first reply to this topic. that's
not a solution, that's a workaround, that we simply attribute the posts to another
author. We don't want to change attribution, but let it remain.

I'd say, at present we are referencing a post to an author by linking to his id in the database.
what if we add another field called Nick Name to the posts table? the NickNames don't change
often, & whenever one changes, the changes can be applied to all the posts? I know that this
can be a bit more resource intensive if the user has many hundreds of posts but that's
all I can think of at the moment.
So by this, if the user is deleted, then that doesn't effect his posts as the name of the author
is not picked from the users table but from the posts table itself.

That would be very poor database form.  If you wanted to change that 
author's name, you'd have to change it in ALL of their posts.  What's 
the problem with reducing level to 0?  It takes up less space that this 
sentence I'm typing right now.  It doesn't clutter the interface, 
because level 0 authors aren't in the "Authors" section, but below in 
their own "Users" section.  I don't see the downside.

What about adding a "deleted" column to the user's information? If a
user is deleted, don't let him log in or show him in the normal
userlist.  And perhaps allow the admin to decide:

1) delete old posts
2) change posts status to draft/hidden
3) leave posts, as-is
3) leave posts, unlink author

What about adding a "deleted" column to the user's information? If a
user is deleted, don't let him log in or show him in the normal
userlist.  And perhaps allow the admin to decide:

1) delete old posts
2) change posts status to draft/hidden
3) leave posts, as-is
3) leave posts, unlink author

There is no point to a deleted column, that in effect is what level 0
is for. Yes they can log in but, they can't do anything.

2) No, this will break all your permanent links, this will deprive
your readers of your content.

4) (the second 3)  You can't do this because then you have to change
all code which expects to be able to retrieve the user information
based on the user id in the post.

Frankly the justification for all this (that there may be a lot of
level-0 users) hasn't convinced me of anything.

But I do agree that deleting a lot of posts en masse is not a good thing.

Demote the user to level 0. That way you minimize what the user can
do, and still get to keep his posts.

Since it will be really hard to incorporate suitable extternal theme .mo

I propose a hybrid solution. When you want to delete a user, you can
click on a 'delete user' button, which internally demotes the user to
a level-0. Without that button things are going to get very confusing:
imagine you're just an average admin user and you want to delete a
user. Which makes more sense to you, pressing a big fat red 'delete
user' button, or changing the users level to 0? It just makes sense
from a usability point of view. But by all means, internally demoting
a user to level 0 makes sense, I suppose.

The only disadvantage to the level-0 solution I can think of is that
when a user is browsing through user profiles, how can they tell if a
user has been deleted? In other words, will we ever need to
differentiate between everyday level-0 users and real deleted users?

How about adding another level for Deleted users? say level -1. The users on this level won't be able to even login & they are displayed only under a new tab "Deleted Users".
That way, normal Level 0 users will be kept apart from Deleted Users.

A user_status already exists in the users table, and as far as I can 
tell it's not presently handled by anything in WordPress. Seems that 
would fit best for defining a user's 'status' on the blog instead of 
playing around with user_level.

I'd rather see a document outling recommendations for CSS class names,
patterned around the common contents of a blog site (sidebar, header,
footer, comments, caption, etc, etc).

Most of this stuff can be done, client-side, for free, with CSS and a
little communicatin between theme and plugin authors. I don't see the
need to add loads of code.

I guess 'the genie is out of the bottle' already.  I see providing new 
templates in the future as further guidelines, but the reality is different 
designers may have varying takes on how to build themes.  There's no reason 
to 'restrict' them, so long as they provide an interface for telling PHP 
what the key elements of the theme construction are.

I am NOT against having a base, common set of CSS -- however, my guess is 
that I'd already be breaking rules on my own site, due to SEO.  And lord 
knows Kubrick, which is now what a large number of new WP sites are based 
off of, has its own approach already.

It's easier to add a bunch of variable/functions to the existing way things 
are styled than to rewrite the code/css to >attempt< to comply (as 
compliance isn't possible in all cases, frankly....).

And I never said 'loads of code'.  We're talking a small table of variables, 
or accessor functions, for looking up the proper tag+class for specific 
types of elements on a page.  And a limited set at that.

Maybe I'll try to draft something up if I can get through my taxes in the 
next few days... ;)

Just to point out a glitch in this thinking- You're saying that 
designers inherently use different layout styles in CSS, yet you think 
it's still possible to maintain compatibility between styles by 
providing a translation table from one name to another?  Why not just 
standardize on a single set of names instead of complicating things with 
a translation table?

The *real* issue that will break this translation table idea is that 
designers can use additional/different tags to demark their content.  A 
prime example of this is the post ID that is attached to posts.  Logic 
would have the post ID for each post be written into the post <div>, but 
in the case of the themes packed with WordPress, they're in the post's 
<h3> title.

Where this complicates things (and why it would even matter to plugin 
authors at all) is if you use these things as IDs for DOM, you have to 
apply it differently for different themes.  On one hand (<h3>) you've 
got to use getElementById(postid).parentElement to get the post div, and 
on the other it's just getElementById(postid).  Who knows what radical 
differences there could be in other layouts!

Using the suggested translation table for the names of elements in this 
case isn't very helpful, since changing the id of the element (a 
difficult thing to do anyway, since it contains the post ID) isn't 
helping to find the correct element.

It seems necessary to me to first create a standard that delineates 
where a plugin can expect to find certain elements and what their names 
(ids) should be, then to create any needed translation services.

An alternative (and maybe this is what you're actually talking about) 
would be to include a table with every theme that describes how to find 
certain elements of the layout.  The table would be indexed by an item 
like "The element containing the entire post, including the title" and 
would provide some method for divulging that tag id based on the current 
post id.  It might work, but I think it's impractical, since publishing 
a standard would do essentially the same thing without forcing theme 
authors to go through the extra work of building a table for each theme.

Enjoying this discussion.

A 'translation table' may be minimizing the complexity of what I've been 
discussing (and why I kept talking about functions).  For MY use, I'm 
thinking about 'how do plugins output HTML that looks the same as the rest 
of the theme'.

Actually, if you read back, I've been talking about this exact thing. 
Frankly, I don't use h3's, if it's an archive list they are h2's, and if 
it's a single-post page the title is an h1.  But I totally agree: people 
have different approaches to encapsulation: it isn't enough to know the 
CLASS name, you have to know the tag(s) wrappering.  At that point, having 
"post_wrap_open" and "post_wrap_close" functions that output the proper 
wrappering might help (this is why in the CG-PowerPack I have my 'sideblock' 
functions, to abstract this very thing from implementation of plugins to the 
output for a sidebar block styling...).

Again totally agreed.  Are there a set of elements you might want access to, 
and a method that'd provide you access by the theme providing the right 
function?  I don't know... you're moving into scripting, and I'm only (at

good point to throw in!

No argument -- I see the 'standard' and 'services' as one, but you can look 
as it as two steps along the path.

Again, I agreed with the earlier post of it is impractical to expect every 
theme author to match a given 'standard' encapsulation, tagging, class 
nomenclature, etc.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love it!  But as I gave my own 
site example above, some of us are concerned about things like SEO 
optimization work, which requires using certain tags in certain places for 
best results.

> Enjoying this discussion.

As am I!  Glad there's some more going on, finally... ;)

So to step back, I guess the basic form I'm looking for is:
- how do I output something that goes in a sidebar/menu and looks right? 
what is the title, what are subelements, etc.  (and 'what' means 'what tag 
and class').
- how do I output something that goes in a 'main content' area, that looks 
like a 'post'?  what is the title, what is any meta-data (timestamp or other 
notation), what is the body of the post, etc.

Note that the 'post' theme info could be used to properly style customized 
pages, such as an RSS feed page (which I've started shipping an example of 
with CG-PowerPack), or a Contact Form page, etc.

This also hits the issues that Kubrick raised, which is using class tagging 
on the id=content block to define a page meant to have a sidebar or not --  
which in 'my world' I'd have done as a enclosing-DIV with id=nosidebar or 
something like that.

Message-ID: <42570742.2010905@developer.bg>

When the blogname does not use only ascii symbols the sanitized name, 
and therefore the directory of the generated site theme, consists 
primarily of % and uncomprehensible letters. Actually it is not a 
problem, but it is not very pleasant to have 
'%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bc-%d0%bb%d0%b8-%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b7%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bc-%d0%bb%d0%b8' 
in the path for the css file and other theme files.

Is generation of site theme really needed? Or couldn't it be with some 
standard name, that does not depend on user input. For example 
'your-theme' or something like that.

I can't moderate them because my server keeps timing out. I know that I can go

I'd say that the comment moderation page should have paginated results. Say 25 or 50 comments at a time. That would be less load on the database & wouldn't result in Server timing out. Also a link/button to delete all comments in moderation would be good, just as a last resort/panic button, so that if you have 1000 comments in moderation, you can delete them all, even if it costs 2-3 legit comments. :)

Yes, I actually forgot about that, but that said, it doesn't allow me to flag

Ah, right. I suppose next to the "Delete Checked" there should be a

No, moderation is just approved = 0.  Approved = 1 is posted for reading, approved = 'spam' is spam and hidden from even moderation list normally (or was in 1.5rel)

Message-ID: <42596B8C.70202@basilcrow.com>

Hey everyone,

After being hit with a bunch of comment spam in the past few days, it 
occurred to me that there might be a rather easy way of filtering spam 
into moderation. It's not an absolutely foolproof method, but I don't 
get much spam anymore with WordPress 1.5, and it might be more of a 
practical aid in defeating what little that I do get.

The idea is: automatically put the comment in moderation (or even mark 
it as spam) if it ends with
    by <a href="(.*)">(.*)</a>
since most comment spam I'm getting nowadays ends with the words "by" 
and a link.

Would anyone be interested in implementing a plugin of some sort for 
this? I have no idea how to go about it.

Basil

In the anti-spam world[1], we'd call that a "bad solution".  Though it
would catch some spam, it's far too simple.  I'd bet on about a 40% or 
more false positive rate.

This certainly doesn't warrant a plugin of its own, IMHO.  Doesn't 
someone have a plugin that allows you to apply a customizable set of 
regex's to comments?

I'd agree it doesn't warrant its own plugin just for that one case. 
CG-Antispam uses a number of techniques, including looking at the links in 
the comment versus domain/word blacklist, number of links, repetitive posts, 
etc.  There's more to it than just something that simple -- you just happen 
to have hit a single-patterned spammer at the moment. ;)

But there's a half-dozen antispam plugins out there that should catch it 
already so long as it's hitting one of the existing filters.  A few do let 
you add your own regex (I don't currently, as I try to avoid regex tests for 
speed reasons...), if you find stuff getting through.

I haven't looked in details yet, but I believe this has already been 
tried (not on WP, I think it was for an MT plugin) and ruled out: many 
big blogging services will have non-matching IPs for that (LiveJournal 
in particular).

This would create false positives with systems that have multiple IP's.
For example, the IP for kimmo.suominen.com is a secondary IP on a server
called beowulf.gw.com.  The trackbacks come from the primary IP, not the
secondary IP.

It is possible for the software to select the IP used for outbound
connections, but most software (including WordPress) does not support
doing so.

I see code in post.php (line 114 in current SVN) that appends a number 
to a the post slug if that post slug already exists. I'm guessing this 
is in place because there is no way to determine if a permalink 
structure will include enough date information (or post ID) to make the 
URI unique?

Can someone confirm/explain this further?

I have a weekly "Around the Web" post and I like having it use the same 
slug every week. I can certainly hack around this for myself, but if 
there is a more global solution I'd be happy to try to implement it.

Alex,

It was in response to this bug, and yes it was because a unique
permalink structure couldn't be guaranteed.

http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=98

For the majority of people, this will provide expected behaviour I
think.  Could the functionality you want be coded in a plugin which
manually converted the slug back to its original?  For example by
hooking post_publish and making a database change?

Cheers,

Jamie.

To self-reply, yes it could.  Attached is a simple plugin that does just
that.  It just resanitizes the post name, but doesn't recheck for
duplicates.  Seems to do the trick, worked on a couple of tests and is
fairly straightforward so hopefully should be fine...

Hope it helps someone.

By the way, Matt's final note on this bug in Mosquito mentions checking
against the permalink structure.  Is this still being considered?

Jamie.

Thanks Jamie. I guess this is easier to update than having to re-hack 
the source. :)

After thinking more about the 'unique permalink' side of things, I 
don't think checking the permalink structure and applying the unique 
suffix or not is a good idea. What may be a unique permalink now could 
easily be non-unique in the future.

For example, someone could decide that in addition to their single 
permalink structure:

/YYYY/MM/DD/post-slug/

they also want posts available by category:

/category-name/post-slug/

I think the default behavior is probably smart, if inelegant for my 
usage.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <425B2EA3.7000908@cornell.edu>

Forgive me if this has come up before.  I just started my transition to 
WP 1.5, and I was all excited about themes, until I realized that they 
were just packaged, pluggable versions of the old wordpress layout 
ideology.  Snap in a layout, switch to another one, etc.  Instead, I was 
hoping that what "themes" meant was an extendable set of data-regions 
stored centrally that then filtered through the "view" of different 
themes.  For example, say I want a sidebar, links, categories, posts, 
asides, and a custom region called "my-picture-of-the-day."  Then, I had 
imagined that all themes would then render my data regions as appropriate.

Obviously this is not the behavior of 1.5, but is this model worth 
looking into?

Perhaps you could tweak things to provide a "second slug" with custom
mod_rewrite rules for this category?

Heh.  I've been talking about that for a year.  I usually refer to it as a 
'nuke model', as the CMS systems out there are more likely to implement 
theming in a system where 'modules' plug in and display things in selected 
areas.  I've thought of doing a really-simple version of this with a custom 
theme + plugin, but...

I'd guess some would say that the 'module' approach leads to more 
cookie-cutter 'themes'.  With CSS and an eye for design (and some javascript 
here or there), you can make truly different looking sites, all with WP 
under the covers, but with an option to use a 'modular' approach to 
displayed content.  In a sense, themes right now encapsulate the basic 
main-content block plus the sidebar block(s).  Plugins can already 
manipulate post content to insert extra stuff into the 'main block' (though, 
actions for pre-/post-post content would help for simple prepend/append of 
related information).  Sidebars at the moment are the realm of html/php...

Now, the OTHER way to approach this topic is one of 'ease of use'.  I can't 
currently switch themes of a certain 'style' (let's say 2-col vs 3-col just 
as a starting point...), and instantly 'keep' the same base content and 
sidebar elements.  That's where the 'module' approach would help.  It'd also 
help as adding elements to a sidebar means editing php, and an 
"add/remove/move-up-down" interface would be oodles easier for the novice. 
;)

The other benefit of the modules approach is in multi-user/hosted 
environments, where users don't need to know PHP at all (like blogger, LJ), 
or hosted versions of those or MT, et al.  Certainly, with many hosts 
installing WP for users, and the 'competition' generally being the no-code 
sites, every further step to remove needing to edit PHP makes it a much 
larger potential platform.

This is all, of course, IMHO. ;)  And it at some level goes back to the same 
old questions: what do the DEVS want to build, what do CURRENT users need, 
and what kind of FUTURE users/growth is desired.

This could be a really interesting development. They'd have to be
called something different, 'themes' isn't very descriptive and is
already taken, 'pluggable data regions' is a bit long and sounds a bit
like computer jargon to the unaware. Something like 'areas'?

Anyway, it'd really extend how powerful WordPress is, and would do it
in a really user-friendly manner. Don't want the calendar? Simply
disable it. Feel like a blogroll? Find someone who's written a
blogroll area, download, install and enable it. Simple. This would be
brilliant.

And although it has to be noted that this functionality can currently
be provided by plugins, this is still a worthwhile development IMO.

I meant to provide some justification, just hit 'Send' instead of
'Save Draft' :)

Right. It's still a worthwhile development because it's essentially a
new type of plugin which is highly specialised to providing sidebar
content, and as such would make the new capabilities easily available
to the users.

This kind of development would take Wordpress very firmly into the CMS
arena and naturally increase it's complexity.

I'm not sure that's where everyone wants to go.

I also suspect that this would be something which would be made much
easier with Smarty

Is there *any* date known for an hypothetical 1.5.1 release?
Many of the current bugs in 1.5 are pretty major show-stoppers for 
advanced plugins.
Among many others, I have a version of Spam Karma 2.0 that's been ready 
for some public beta-testing for a while now, except I cannot really 
roll it out completely as long as I am not able to clearly tell users 
"Upgrade to version X before using SK2".

  Instead, I am currently stuck with a lame middle-ground between 
telling novice users to stick with the very obsolete SK1 and recommend 
more advanced users to patch WP by themselves or grab SVN. In both 
cases, I end up doing hours of redundant support and explaining...

I am quite aware that we do not want rushed release and the pace should 
be reasonable. But considering 1.5.1 is a pure bug-fixing release (it 
*is*, right?), I do not see what the issue is with deciding on a 
reasonable date, *announce it* (particularly to developers), do basic 
beta testing and release it with strong suggestion to all users to 
upgrade it... At the moment, there are new people everyday downloading 
a version that has known problems with its plugin API: it will be much 
harder to get these users to upgrade once more than having them 
download right away the correct bug-fixing minor release.

So, any date?

Thanks,

1.5.1 is suppose to be realesed in various locale version too, we
talked about having a system to generate differente locale
distribution automatically, making our transaltion works easy.

Actually i'm already distributing an 1.5.1 italian beta version, to
have some more users than th translation team testing the translation
and giving suggestion/bugs etc in the translation. I keep this version
update weekly on SVN. Practically we are already doing some betatest
on it (i manage the wikyitaly site and my personal blog with this
version)

That was my thinking too, though obviously you probably don't want to be

Kind of undermines the 'perma'! Glad it helped :)

For what it's worth, I'm in the same position with two plugins. I'd
really like to see 1.5.1 soon.

I'm still having commit problems. Has anyone else looked at this?:

   http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=582

It's minor, but I've been running my site with this patch for a while 
now, and nothing has blown up. It might save somebody a few bytes of 
bandwidth now and again.

In the Struts/Java world, this sort of thing is usually referred to as a 
"tile".  I think that's a good name.

Yeah.

The reason I write that is because I want meta themes.  I'm not the kind 
of type who wants to slap in some themes and release my new website.  At 
a minimum, I'm going to heavily customize a codebase ... but 
unfortunately there I lose the customization when I switch between themes!

Thanks,

I'd really appreciate if this fix (or a more comprehensive fix) were 
applied so that url_to_postid() works for subpages and for pages on 
non-mod_rewrite setups.
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1214

Also this CSS fix for the admin should be probably be included... as 
more 1.5.1 compatible plugins start being written, people's submenus are 
going to wrap over, and with the 1.5 CSS, that doesn't work so well.
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1138

Other than that... I think we're ready at least for a preliminary 
release candidate!   I encourage others to speak up if they have any 
severe issues or "low-lying-fruit" type issues that could quickly be fixed.

I'd appreciate it if someone could look at:

http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=911

It's relatively minor, but annoying for multi-author blogs. The post
author is set to the first in the list (usually 'admin') unless you
remember to change it.

Greets,

I've been more or less working on 'tiles' in the past few weeks or so. I created
a canvas that could allow me to add and remove features in one click, through
the use of plugins.

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/sem-theme/

It is far from over, but I think I can share a few educated viewpoints.

WordPress is not far from having a temporary solution already. At most, we're
missing a few api hooks like wp_head and wp_footer. Once these are available,
you can create the template as such:

<div id="header"> ... <?php wp_head(); ?> ... </div>
<div id="body"> ... loop <?php wp_post(); ?> ... <?php wp_comment(); ?> ...
</div>
<div id="sidebar"> ... <?php wp_sidebar(); ?> ... </div>
<div id="footer"> ... <?php wp_footer(); ?> ... </div>

And add a plugin to configure and filter the hooks for your theme -- like I did
in my theme, though arguably not to such an extent.

This has two downsides:

- On the one side, theme authors need to be extremely wary of inserting hooks at
the right places.

- On the other, plugin authors need to be consistent in the way they wrap
plugins, and should probably encapsulate plugin in a way to make it theme
independent -- rather than specifically designed for the Kubrick theme.

Arguably, the above is far from satisfying to the more control hungry users. But
it is good enough for the average blogger who doesn't want to edit a php file.
And quite frankly, I found it good enough to resist the idea (trouble?) of
managing a site with Mambo or Limbo -- WordPress' simplicity gives it a lot
more potential than the two previous.

I think three key key points could make things easier for everyone:

- Having WordPress visit the theme's config.php file immediately after visiting
the plugin files, including when you are in the admin section
- A define_area function for theme authors, that lets them define areas named
'header', 'footer', 'pre_post', etc. as they see fit; a define_tile would
likely be a good idea too
- An option panel called "Plugin Display" panel, where plugins are listed, each
with a select box populated by the current theme's area, to let the user define
where he wants the features he is adding to be displayed

my $.02

The first point, I argued for a while, and from the looks of the 
conversations it probably won't happen.

Message-ID: <1113350837.425c62b583d9c@80.253.99.25>

hello,

while programing a couple of plugins, i've been using things such as:

apply_filters('the_permalink', get_permalink($cur_post->ID));
apply_filters('the_permalink', get_category_link($cur_cat->cat_ID) );

it initially occured to me it would be nice to use them rather than hard coding
the permalinks.

but only initially. i eventually found myself wondering how a silly blog page
could require 40+ queries...

has anyone programmed a function I could use that would be more appropriate?

i'd be looking for something like:

function get_permalink_no_db( $post )
{
  if ( /* no need to query db */ )
    return /* the permalink with no db access */
  else
    return get_permalink()
}

and:

function get_category_link_no_db( $cat )
{
  if ( /* no need to query db */ )
    return /* the permalink with no db access */
  else
    return get_category_link()
}

Is this with 1.5.1?  The caching has been changed a bit in 1.5.1.  You
shouldn't see multiple queries, especially not with categories since we
query all categories up front.  You might see multiple queries if your
plugin is pulling in posts that are not part of the main query.  The
plugin can use update_post_caches() or update_post_cache() to avoid
multiple queries.

Right, the point was more that future functionality could easily spawn 
new permalink structures. Slugs that are unique in a current structure 
might not be in a future structure.

So, blog authors can insert HTML into their titles and posts?
Admittedly, perhaps some stripping of particular elements (e.g.
"script") could/should be done, the arbitrary conversion of _all_ tags
is a bit daft. Look out for those "<em>" tags!

I understand this somewhat differently. As in, a registered level 0 user could
get my admin cookie. So the severity is medium indeed.

Speaking of cookies, I saw WordPress stores an md5 hash of the user's account
md5 hashed password in a cookie. This is hacker bait. I personally did the
following on my previous sites:

on login:
- generate random token
- store token and user id in cookie
- store token, user id and user ip in a session table

session_id | session_token | user_id | user_ip

on page view:
- match broadcasted data to session data
  => up to here, it works much the same as wordpress
- check IP; on inconsistency, log user out and warn admin
  => differs from WordPress, I believe
- else continue, and regen token every so often
  => differs from WordPress, I believe

downside:
- not perfect either (you can still hijack an account, but it is much more
difficult)

upsides:
- hacker cannot decrypt login + password by simply catching a cookie

optionally, allow only one session per user_id. this limits the risk to lose
your blog if you forget to log out from a cybercoffee.

likewise, optionally log off after a timeout period.

Weee, thanks a lot! Two dozen queries got their heads chopped off!

Btw, you might want to check (or change) the workflow. Through trials and errors
using SAVEQUERIES, I found a call to get_permalink queries the DB twice per
post. To reproduce this, try:

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/recent-updates/

and comment out the two lines where I cache the posts.

A temporary fix I came up with was to call both update_post_cache() and
update_page_cache(), but this is obviously not the right thing to do. Maybe
update_page_cache could be a mere alias for update_post_cache.

Consider this scenario:

on a weblog, "options - general" the owner has checked: "anyone can 
register"
in "options - writing" the owner has checked "Newly registered members: 
May submit drafts for review" (or worse "May publish articles" but 
let's forget about that for now)

Malicious user registers, writes a draft article, where the javascript 
attempts to steal the admin cookie.

Owner logs on, sees a new draft, clicks on it to view, and has just 
lost his weblog.

And the owner set him/herself up for that when they checked users can
register and new users can submit drafts or post articles.

Seriously people exactly when do we require some sort of
accountability on the part of the user?

Can we issue a 'last call' for bugs here then? I think quite a few
people are eager to get 1.5.1 out a.s.a.p.

By the way, how's the i8n side of things coming along? Are we ready to
go to 1.5.1 there as well?

That's correct & I support it. If you don't trust anyone, then don't give them the rights to POST. Its as simple as that!!

I'd say, if you want anyone to register & post on your blog, then there should be an option to disable the <script> tags etc. But disabling them by default & not having the option to enable them will be very restricting.

That's pretty extreme. One person would have to invest a lot of time and 
technical knowledge to execute that kind of exploit for very little (one 
blog) payoff.

Additionally, if they do contain control (however they manage it, JS 
XMLhttprequest *might* work) then what? They log in, post a bunch of 
crap, hijack the blog for 20 minutes? Big deal. You should have backups, 
and they don't actually have any passwords (they only have md5'd 
cookies). So the recovery, sure, would be a pain, but would be quick. 
Combine that with the minimal likely hood of this happening and I don't 
think this comes close to anything critical.

Someone else brought this up a few days ago in the support forms - same 
bug, "Users can post malicious code to the blog via script/iframe tags" 
to which one responded, "So what you are saying is that trusted users 
can post HTML to a blog? Yeah. They can."

Seems way outta proportion.

Finally, the people who have the skill to do this -- and the motivation 
to hack -- would probably have bigger fish to fry than a multiuser, 
non-authenticated blog site.


The suggestion has been offered before: If you are really afraid of your 
users, write a plugin to do additional KS filtering on your blog content 
so that script/iframe/scary tags are removed. Problem solved.

This is someone looking for recognition by trying to identify a 
non-issue as a problem. WordPress is highly secure by default. Should 
you be worried about this? Not if you haven't been worried by the past 5 
years of blogging software or any other CMS in the world.

That said, I think a default feature restricting users lower than level 
8 to a known subset of HTML would be useful, and will be including a 
future release. A while back Mark Ghosh created the giant array that 
KSES needs to accomplish this, I'm sure he (or I) still have it somewhere.

Er... Were I a hacker taking advantage of said exploit, I would definitly not
deface the blog. Rather, I would:

- fetch config.php through the file editor, to get the db server name, db name,
user name, and password
- try using the info to log into the ftp; else try using the built-in file
editor to create files; on success, set up a porn site, warez site, casino
spam, link farm, spam server, you name it; the user will not notice unless he
can access his raw stats (many users use an image or js based service that only
tracks users on pages you built)
- log into mysql and create table my_junk; store warez, mp3s and porn as
necessary; the user will never notice unless he knows how to access his db
- last but not least, assume there is a telnet access on the account for some
reason...

You mis-cut the comment, attributing that quote to me when it wasn't 
mine. Anyway, you're assuming way too much malice in the attacker.

ready-made cookie-stealing scripts are available from other exploits, 
so putting a simple exploit script together for wordpress isn't that 
difficult. Getting the exploit script to automatically search for 
wordpress blogs with these options set is just cut and paste from other 
existing exploits as well - I assume lots of us remember the attacks 
from the phpscripting host scam site, it's the reason I block all 
"lwp-agent " user-agent strings from my weblog.

It's terribly tempting for a script-kiddie to do the copy/paste, launch 
the resulting script and sit back and watch cnet report "thousands of 
weblogs defaced"

I do agree with Matt that a simple limited html-disable for certain 
user levels is more than enough to plug this hole.

just a thought... do you disallow other files to view it? as in, would it be
possible to create a file using the file editor, meant to view config.php?

I'd say, make that optional. I've got a multi-author blog but
I don't want everyone access to admin functions. So I've all
of them on level 2 & some on level 5(sub-admins).
But I want them to be able to post any HTML they want as they
are trusted that much. :)

How about making the user-level below which the restriction is in effect be a dropdown list in the options somewhere... and have the lowest be 2, so no 'accidents'.

For it_IT group yes, ll files that need translation (importo*.php,
license, readme, default template) are translated and revised.

ABout gettext error we still have a problem with the string in the
Dashboard, the one that says: There are currently XX posts and XX
comments, contained within XX categories.

It's a multiline text that donesn't get gettexedd correctly, actully
I'm not able to find the mosquito entry related to this.

Actually it's the only i8n problem still open.

The way I see this, it is entirely silly that someone would post such a 
vunerability. 

As far as Denis' comments, if I remember correctly passwords are stored as a 
double hashed md5, which would be very tiresome to reverse, although it 
would still be possible, but this isn't the way a person would go about 
stealing accounts imho. As far as IP address checking, it inadvertantly 
defeats the purpose of cookies for those who are on dialup or an ISP that 
changes IP addresses constantly. As far as optionally logging off after a 
certain period, WordPress already does it, although it is a very long 
period. If someone leaves their blog logged in at a cybercafe, there's not 
much that can be done to help, except moving to sessions so that when the 
browser is closed the session is destroyed. I had a working hacked together 
session script, but its been lost in my clutter, but maybe it is something 
we should consider and do like many sites do by having a checkbox to use 
sessions if at a public terminal.

They could still just edit a plugin with code that would spit out the 
contents of wp-config.php and then they would have full access to your 
database.

This isn't a problem for trusted users... levels 2 and up.  But for 
"submit a draft only" users, we should be stripping out javascript and 
any other dangerous code.

I believe user_level of 5 or higher is required to edit a plugin via
the plugin editor, so this particular approach probably isn't
exploitable.

With level 1 access you can get the cookie for the higher level users, 
and then you could log in at the higher level user and run whatever PHP 
code you wanted.

Jennifer suggested this back in October:

I think a "Remember me" checkbox on login would be really useful.  It's 
worked well for Movable Type.  I'm just always afraid that I'm going to 
log in at a public place and forget to log out.

With a cluster of IBM mainframes or supercomputers, it is possible
under an hour, when there are "collisions" - where two strings map to
the same hash. Hell, if the cracker had a supercomputer, or access to
a cluster that can do this, I'd invite him over for tea. Jokes apart,
a doubly-hashed string is not reversible, using practical, easily
available tools.

I just looked over the link to the original advisory, and I found it rather 
halarious that the person who posted this was also silly enough to include 
code that wouldn't do anything at all to help the problem. Just thought I'd 
share.

function get_the_title($id = 0) {
	.
	.
	.
	$sb_convert = $output;
	$sb_input =  array("<",">","(",")");
	$sb_output = array("&lt;","&gt;","&#40;","&#41;");
	$output = str_replace($sb_input, $sb_output, $sb_convert);
	return $title;
}

Ryan,

Can you close issue #917, please?  It is not a bug (in WP).

On the i18n front -- I'm going to work on translating the new messages
(such as the mail messages) for the fi locale this weekend.  Other than
that, fi is in shape for release.

Thanks,
+ Kim

Anything is possible, but I think the security/usability tradeoffs we 
make maximize the security of WordPress and the user experience. Sure, 
it could be a lot more ultra-paranoid, but I don't think users would 
really gain anything except complexity. Would you live in a house where 
you had to do a biometric scan to be able to move between rooms?

I would if the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition team were in some way able 
to get a hold of a (falsified) video with a sad story about how I was 
going to nearly die if they didn't come over to my house and install 
biometric scanners because I had a really, really severe mental/physical 
disorder that required me to feel safe by having biometric scanners 
between each room.  Which, by the way, would be equipped with the latest 
AOL enabled computers, Sears brand furnishings and the house I once live 
in would have been completely demolished and rebuilt by a crack team of 
'just add water' home builders who /might/ have measured once, cut two 
or three times but managed to construct a house like object in less than 
36 hours.  Why do you ask? ;)

Good to know that we don't disagree on this Matt :) I said the same
thing as you did, in probably a more obfuscated fashion.

I think people are getting defensive and dismissing this out of hand.
It's not critical, but neither is it nothing at all.

If I get access to the file editor, I get to execute completely
arbitrary PHP code on your server. Which means I can easily compromise
the Apache user on your server, which may mean all sorts of unpleasant
things.

You can only get access to the file editor as an authorized user.  It 
seems to me that a couple of conditions would need to preexist on the 
server for the javascript insertion to even pose a threat; conditions 
that don't preexist in a default WordPress install.  It seems very 
unlikely that the javascript trick alone could post any threat but an 
annoyance from users that a diligent site owner should not have 
authorized in the first place.

Nonetheless, the enclosed patch prevents any user from reading or 
writing a file that contains the DB_PASSWORD constant, including the 
wp-admin/templates.php file.  With this not only can't you read files 
that contain your WordPress database password via the web interface, you 
can't alter existing files to output the password.  Of course, this will 
prevent you from editing wp-config.php, setup-config.php, 
wp-config-sample.php, and wp-db.php, but if you have cause to mess with 
those files in the first place, you probably know how to use FTP or SSH 
which would probably be better suited.

Since one could still save a file (e.g. a plugin or theme component)
that outputs the contents of wp-config.php on a web page, is checking
for DB_PASSWORD really that useful?

i second that... moreover, you could do all sorts of workarounds like:

echo constant("D"."B"."_"."P"."A"."S"."S"."W"."O"."R"."D");

ah well... the more paranoid know better than leaving the file editor anyway.

I've always wondered why the info is stored in constants and not a variable 
that is unset immediately after the database connection. Any particular 
reason?

well, loading the wp-config file will re-create the variable, no? ;)
but it can be made like if connection exists, then the wp-config file is not loaded else load it. stil then, the db user/password is still hard-coded into the wp-config. ;)

That's basically the same as

http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=925

The workaround is also documented there (changing the default_charset
value that PHP is using).

Yes. You are right.

Changing the default_charset is a lot easier than adding and adding 
headers to each different file. However we cannot rely on the fact that 
Allow Override has acceptable value (not to mention other web servers...).

does the wordpress API have a query batch somewhere?

I think it would be nice to develop plugins using:

// add to the list of queries to do
add_to_query_batch( $query, $result_name );

function my_filter( $my_data )
{
  // everything is properly cached
}

I agree -- it would be better to make WordPress as impervious to the
defaults in PHP and Apache as possible.  For example, I think having a
central file for all the headers would be a good direction to go.

In this particular case, one could probably use the ini_set() function
inside WordPress instead of the php_value directive in .htaccess (to
avoid the dependency on "Allow Override").

For non-PHP files there is also the Apache directive AddDefaultCharset
to consider, which might prove more problematic to address.

PHP has this nice feature for variables called unset. unset('varname') and 
you don't have to worry about the rest of the script being able to access 
it. Call unset on the variables right after the database connection is 
established and then it guarantees that you can't access them elsewhere 
(minus inside the wpdb class if they're stored there, and if so, it could be 
made not to store them there and not lose any functionality).

I think this is a very good idea, I wish we had had it before 1.0.
Unfortunately:

"Constants may not be redefined or undefined once they have been set;"

I don't want to break everyone's config files. Perhaps instead of 
including wp-config.php we can evaluate it and extract that data out 
instead, though that would be slower.

I know what you are trying to say & I know that once a variable is unset, it can't be accessed in the script anymore. But you didn't understand what I meant. What I was saying is that:-

1) what good it would do to unset the db vars? added security? no-one able to access db user/password?

2) the wp-config file is loaded on every page load in WordPress, right? so the variables are created everytime wp-config is loaded. you can ofcourse unset them as soon as they are loaded

3) the db user/password are still hardcoded in the wp-config file, so anyone having access to it can have them.

4) if wp-config is loaded everytime on a page load, then wouldn't it be better to check if a db connection exists or not? if the connection exists, then there's no need to load wp-config. however, if db connection doesn't exist, then it can be loaded. no?

hope I make myself clearer this time. :)

My point was a bit more security against the script kiddies and noobies, if 
they were to get access to the file editor. We already know you can't edit 
the wp-config file or anything, but you could still echo out the constants 
anywhere. This would get rid of that risk. As far as people just fopening it 
and parsing them out from there, not much we can do to avoid that. I know it 
doesn't help security much, but it'd make things a bit more difficult for 
script kiddies

It might, but it might also generate a false sense of security amongst 
our users.

The simple fact is that there is no sure-fire way to totally protect 
your wp-config.php data unless you personally review every line of code 
in every plugin you install.

We can't -- and arguably shouldn't try to -- protect against attacks 
from other locally installed PHP scripts.

Better, I think, to inform the users that wp-config.php contains the 
"keys to the kingdom", so to speak; and they should protect it 
appropriately: `chmod 650; chown user.www-data` for example.  Advise 
users to be aware of the fact that a malicious plugin could expose this 
data, even though filesystem security is set appropriately.

ok, so that's not possible, I mean we can't unset a constant as Matt said & he doesn't want to change now & break the wp-config files of users.
so what we can do is:-

the `$wpdb` object is global, right? so it can be accessed without redefining the connection again or including it in the script. so I'd say that lets check on every page load whether `$wpdb` exists or not. If it exists, then don't load the wp-config file(there's no need if I'm not wrong). so that way the constants are inaccessible as they are not global(as far as I know). we can't undo the constants but we can still restrict its access by this, so they'll be loaded & accessible only once, next page load & they are gone!!

how about it? Matt?

Unfortunately, I don't think that'd work at all really. In this case, mySQL 
isn't on a persistant connection, and even if it was, you would still have 
to have the user/pass to access the resource (iirc, don't hold me to this). 
At any rate, this would provide no benefit

@scott - I was speaking about in the case that this so called "exploit" 
works and someone gets admin or even upper level account stuff. At any rate, 
these little tweaks would probably not be worth it in the long run.

Points 1, 2 and 4 of this optimization suggestion would be nice if they occured
in 1.5.1.

Point 3 is less trivial, and requires some testing because odds are strong imho
that it will conflict with plugins.

If you gain access to file editor, it takes only one '<? echo
file("wp-config.php") ?>' inserted into any template or plugin, and you can
see the db password, so IMHO (un)setting variables all the time is useless.

My point was a bit more security against the script kiddies and noobies, if
they were to get access to the file editor. We already know you can't edit
the wp-config file or anything, but you could still echo out the constants
anywhere. This would get rid of that risk. As far as people just fopening it
and parsing them out from there, not much we can do to avoid that. I know it
doesn't help security much, but it'd make things a bit more difficult for
script kiddies

Well, blacklisting usually doesn't "just happen".  At least not in my 
system.  It's usually for a good reason.  I did notice that some of you 
are getting higher-than-usual scores because the dial-up number or IP 
address you were assigned had been blacklisted.  If that IP shows up in 
Received headers, you'll hit RCVD_IN_* SpamAssassin rules.  Best 
solution is to redial or reset your DSL modem and hope you get a 
different address assigned by DHCP.

Note, IronPort's Senderbase system is useful for checking all this out:

http://www.senderbase.org/

It has a handy meta-directory of blacklists.

I just checked, nothing special about my IP address. I'm on cable and I've 
had the same IP for 6 months, so I doubt that it is the problem. I didn't 
get one from this thread, so maybe it had something to do with the "exploit" 
thread. At any rate, its terribly annoying to get my posts flagged as spam.

Its not about using persistant connections. WP doesn't open a persistant connection. But what I'm saying is that you can access a global object without creating it everytime. I also use ezSQL, the same class that WP uses for db. You create an object of that class & pass connection info to it & it opens a connection. Now to try this out, create a page that defines this db object as global, lets say $mydb & make it an object of the ezSQL class & connect to db. Now in another page, just access the global object $mydb & do some db stuff. You can do that, while you defined $mydb in another page which doesn't have any link with this 2nd page.

That's what I'm saying to do, that if the db object exists, then there's no need to reload the wp-config as it contains just the db info & we don't need it if a db object already exists for us to use.

We're not loading wp-config.php more than once per request, if that's
what you mean. If not, let me outline the problem:

1. Request comes in to WordPress. $wpdb object set up, connection to
database set up.
2. Stuff happens. Posts displayed.
3. Request shutdown. PHP destroys all variables. Connection to mySQL closed.

Now, unless we keep the connection to mySQL persistent over requests
[1], the best we can do is use the same database connection all the
way through the request, which is what we're doing at the moment.

[1]: unless we did something like sessionise $wpdb, but this'd
introduce a whole load of permissions problems and would likely be
more overhead anyway.

  Its not about using persistant connections. WP doesn't open a persistant connection. But what I'm saying is that you can access a global object without creating it everytime. I also use ezSQL, the same class that WP uses for db. You create an object of that class & pass connection info to it & it opens a connection. Now to try this out, create a page that defines this db object as global, lets say $mydb & make it an object of the ezSQL class & connect to db. Now in another page, just access the global object $mydb & do some db stuff. You can do that, while you defined $mydb in another page which doesn't have any link with this 2nd page.

  That's what I'm saying to do, that if the db object exists, then there's no need to reload the wp-config as it contains just the db info & we don't need it if a db object already exists for us to use.

yes, generally any apache/php request is a temporal, one-shot process, completely stateless.  Frankly, the entire web works that way.  'State' is introduced using things like sessions and cookies, and in more advanced applications sessions migrate to data stores, java applets can store state in javabeans that can even migrate between servers, etc.

the only truly persisting web apps would be connected java/etc. which open up a communication socket (TCP or otherwise) with a server and it remains open for an extended duration.  all other persistance on the web is otherwise 'artificial', using some kind of caching mechanism (cookie, sessions, to disk, in memory, to db server, etc.).  There's power and flexibility from that, in that you can scale lightweight sites to heavily redundant server farms with ease (heavier sites, with lots of session data get a bit more complex, usually requiring persisting the session state into a separate db server cluster on the back end...).

fun fun fun. ;)

Have you tried setting up the HTTPS server using the ProxyPass (and
ProxyPassReverse) directives to the HTTP instance?

I was wondering... What are the planned changes for WordPress 1.6?

If things are still unclear, I would like to suggest maximizing performance. My
feeling is there is plenty of overhead and even a couple of simple things could
make a big difference.

Several queries, in particular, are mandatory at the moment and could be
programed to be triggered only when required. e.g. users, options, categories,
comment count, post meta...

And sometimes, bugs in the workflow produce entirely useless queries, e.g. i
recall eyeing fetch post twice and similar when the data is available.

I am also rather curious, why does query count on index increase 
proportionally to the number of posts on index? for example if you install a 
fresh wp 1.5 installation and make posts one by one you'll notice 
considerable query count increase. How come?

I think it depends on which parts of the system are being used. For
example I've just tried your experiment with the classic theme and the
number of queries (14) stays constant regardless of the number of
posts.

I also added comments to each post one at a time and the number still
stayed constant.

It may be that you have a plug-in or possibly a feature of Wordpress
which isn't used in the classic theme turned on which is making extra
queries per post.

So, for example, a 'word count' plugin or a 'more like this' plugin
might do extra queries per post.

You would need to do some mored investigation before you could
determine that it was core wordpress which was causing the extra
queries.

I had a similar problem because of plugins interacting with get_permalink
functions and related. It is mostly solved in 1.5.1, I think: my recent plugins
only do two queries at most now, thanks to the caching.


There are other issues, though. Namely:

http://www.semiologic.com/cats/blog/?debug=1

is hardly optimal. It calls:

/* sem_sp_cats */ SELECT DISTINCT categories.*, COUNT( post_id ) > 0 AS
has_posts FROM wp_categories AS categories ...

the above via my theme because:

SELECT * FROM wp_categories

is called after the 'init' rather than before, and doesn't tell if cats are
non-empty.

I've no clue where these come from:

SELECT cat_ID FROM wp_categories WHERE category_nicename = 'blog'

SELECT cat_name FROM wp_categories WHERE category_nicename = 'blog' x3

I think BA stats is responsible for one of the calls. The other four come from
WordPress. I dare add I am not listing a tree of categories.

As for why WordPress is querying for users, options, meta, comment counts, etc.,
or why the page needs > 0.4 seconds to be generated, I remain speechless --
Markdown and my resource hungry smart link plugin are neither called here.

<URL:http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6> describes some of the  
features the developers want to add.

Personally, some way to get support for postgresql without wordpress-pg  
would be something I would like to see but that isn't optimisation in the  
same sense.

I see no indication that 1.5.1 has been officially released.

I think it's great that folks are looking ahead, but quite a few of us 
are still waiting for an official 1.5.1 release.

I see you turn debug mode on using by adding ?debug=1 at the end of the blog

you'll want to add the following somewhere in your config.php file:

if ( $debug )
	define ('SAVEQUERIES', true);

and the following in your footer:

if ( defined("SAVEQUERIES") && SAVEQUERIES == true )
{
	foreach( $wpdb->queries as $query )
	{
		list( $db_query, $time ) = $query;
		echo "<p style=\"font-size:
8pt\"><strong>$time</strong><br/><code>$db_query</code></p>";
	}
}

For the postgresql, I doubt that will become an official project any time 
soon, because of the reliance of almost all time handling on mysql's time 
and date functions that postgresql doesn't have. As far as optimization, I 
think that a lot of plugins are more of the cause of high overhead than a 
plain old WordPress.

Matt mentioned this before but more (I thought) in the context of poor 
coding. Anyone prepared to point the finger at bad plugins ? the point 
being of course to make things better rather than blame anyone !

Sure:

- stat plugins tend to have overheads when they are not grabbing the 'shutdown'
plugin hook; i've seen stat plugins do insert statements (yuck!) before the
page was fully sent to the user

- data retrieving plugins such as rss aggregators trivially tend to have huge
overheads when they do not cache results often enough and when they do the
caching at the wrong moment (the right moment being 'shutdown', with the
results sent via an iframe, rather than 'init')

- recent [your pick] plugins tend to have huge overheads in 1.5 and lower unless
you stay away from built-in wordpress functions. i've chopped the overhead of my
fuzzy recent plugins by a factor of 5 since the beginning of the week on an
1.5.1 platform, and i think there still is room for a little more optimization.
thus, there is plenty of room to tweak around here

- markdown brings considerable overhead; i presume the same goes for textile,
string-processing, and text to image features and plugins. there's not much you
can do here besides caching.

- my smart link plugin still has a significant overhead. i've significantly
chopped it by doing some caching, by triggering the caching only when
necessary, and by optimizing the regexps. at this point, there's not much more
i can do short of storing aggregate results for future use, and i'd really hate
to do this without triggers, functions and stored procedures

- subscribe to comments brings some overhead, though not anything close to
comparable to markdown. And from mentioning it to Mark, I understand this comes
from the wp workflow: his options have the autoload set to 'yes', yet queries to
the options table still occur


More generally, i'd say wp and plugin overheads comes from:

- An unoptimized/buggy workflow, as in making the same query multiple times,
making a resource hungry action occur at the wrong place (e.g. init, when it
might as well occur in shutdown), or making queries without checking that they
will be useful first (e.g. category caching should only occur when they are
used for the first time)

- Exploring huge object arrays, as in my blog cat listing. -1 number of posts,
in particular could probably signal removing where post_id in ( /* all */ )
clauses, which bring sql overheads in addition to exploring 100+ object arrays

- Using regular expressions and other string formatting operations, which are
resource hungry as a rule; but i think wordpress has better things to
concentrate on

- Not using sql triggers, functions and stored procedures, but then this solely
comes from mysql not being a relevant language to manage a db

Lastly, I'd presume, from watching LightPress at a distance, that parsing big
chunks of source code also brings a non-neglectable overhead. I was quite
surprised to see that LightPress outperformed a WordPress install with
staticize enabled.

That's a big list, yet I have not seen anything anywhere that could 
guide users as to what should / could be used together without overly 
stressing a server. Okay so that comes down to how exactly a user 
implements the actual plugins but from that list some basics must surely 
be able to be distilled and written up ?
When things goes wrong, the host will blame WP, coders will blame the 
user / plugin author, the user will shout at everyone but no-one then 
learns and that cannot be good surely ?

The query counter - is that a measure ? Is less better or can the count 
be higher but more efficient ? The counter has been there since a long 
time ago yet has recieved little attention - maybe some explanation and 
examples would be good ? And what has the timer got to do with it ?

What this actually comes down to though is how many people it affects 
and how many it could affect. If the second number could get large then 
maybe something needs addressing now ?

When I started this discussion, I had no other idea in mind than working towards
coming up with said list. I feel this is a part of WordPress that will greatly
benefit from teamwork.


> The query counter - is that a measure ? Is less better or can the count be
higher but more efficient ?

The query counter is a highly significant measure, since it measures the number
of return trips to your sql server. The three chief resource hoggers in
softwares are the use of complex algorithms, exploring huge chunks of decision
trees that you could have avoided with a simple test before hand, and the use
of resources located elsewhere.

It is thus in your interest to minimize the number of accesses to your database.
But it is not in your interest to select * from DB either, since you'll end up
manipulating hordes of arrays and objects, and thus using complex algorithms
that are likely to underperform accessing the DB multiple times.

With a real SQL language, you would call a stored procedure that would return a
batch of relevant data sets in a mere one trip to your SQL server per page.
With MySQL, a few of the optimizations that would be in the stored procedure
end up in the php. These include:

- Caching options, categories, and the like, since they are used often
- Triggering the latter to be cached only on first request
- including that little extra something in a query that makes 80% other calls to
another query irrelevant. For instance:

SELECT
  *, meta_value as page_template
FROM
  posts
LEFT JOIN
  postmeta ON posts.ID = postmeta.post_id
WHERE
  posts.post_status = 'static'
  AND meta_key = '_wp_page_template'
  AND ...

- changing the tables to reflect that 80% of calls to a second query are cruft
(e.g. _wp_page_template could also be used for posts)
- storing aggregate results to avoid queries altogether (e.g. storing the number
of posts in a cat, the number of comments in a post, etc.), but i'd recommend
against this for wp as doing so without a proper SQL language (data integrity,
triggers, functions and stored procedures) is a recipe for disasters

I trust it affects everyone, and that it is low priority for most people.

The query counter also has a timer for each query. Most queries take a 
completely insignificant amount of time, so targetting just the # would be 
premature optimization. (The root of all evil.) The bulk of WP overhead 
comes from the large number of includes and lines of code. Making things 
load more intelligently has been improving with every release.

A non-proprietary format readable online would've been nice.

I like the genreal idea to revamp the admin menu; though I don't know 
that I like the specific proposal.  Comments might merit their own 
top-level menu item; but I don't like stuffing so much other stuff into 
"Configuration"...   Though if a vertical left-side menu were supplied 
for "Configuration", I might not mind so much.

"Make the default ?Configuration? page show an overview of all the 
administrative functions along with short text descriptions."
I like this idea quite a bit.

"Replace the numeric ?level? attribute with a set of descriptive user 
levels, such as:"
This is a nice idea, but the proposed user levels look _worse_ than 
all-numeric levels, I think.  "Manager Level 2" seems too bulky.

The rest of the items mostly made sense.  I wouldn't have any real 
problems if they were integrated.

Subject: [wp-hackers] seperate writable directory
Message-ID: <000901c5438a$5a1e2500$4d20010a@a1>


Its a request & a suggestion.
Why don't we have a directory like wp-write in the WordPress root which can contain all the directories that you need to have write permissions on? Like those required by plugins Staticize, WP-Cache, ImageHeadline, etc. For now they require a directory in wp-contents which should have write permissions. I don't know about you guys but if a directory "abc" needs write permissions in wp-content, I need to give the same to wp-contents as well, or it doesn't work!!

This just seems like ridiculous!! & I don't want my wp-contents to be writable!! so I have a directory for this purposes where I store all directories that need write permissions  & I've to hack the plugins to follow this new directory structure!!

It would be good if this thing can be rolled in & followed by all plugin authors who need writable directories in their plugins. Having all the writable directories in a single writable root directory really looks more organised IMHO. :)

any thoughts?

What OS are you using?  On UNIX for a directory to be "writable", the
permissions of the parent directories need to only to have execute
permissions (so that known path names can be accessed).  You'll also
want the read permissions on for any directory that needs to be listed
(that's what "reading a directory" means).

I just tried out WP-Cache on my server (UNIX -- NetBSD) and used these
permissions:

    drwxrwxr-x  7 kim  kim   512 Apr 17 15:56 wp-content
    drwxrwxr-x  2 www  kim  1024 Apr 17 16:02 wp-content/cache

The web server process runs as user www, so I made it the owner of
the directory and gave the owner full access.

Only I can write to the wp-content directory.

Regards,
+ Kim

Creating such a directory would suggest that users need to make it writable 
for wordpress to work, which is not the case. You shouldn't need to make 
wp-content have the same permissions as the subdirectories unless you have 
some obscure permissions system (highly unlikely). You should check into 
UNIX permissions a bit more.

But that's how it is now... just, that directory is called "wp-content"  
What's wrong with wp-content being writable?

Some pretty good suggestions. However, "Rename the ?Post slug? box." 
doesn't jive with me. I would say that falls under "learning" curve. 
There is not going to be a concise phrase that will accurately describe 
what that bit of text does to a new user.




"While the visual design and presentation of WordPress is
excellent, the use of color has not been maximized."

I'm kinda in line with this, but I might also suggest that if menus were 
restructured, that *icons* were used as well. I like little 'notepads' 
next to the 'new post' button, or a 'checkbox' next to 'options'. The 
visual clues of icons are much quicker to pick out than text.




"But it is likely that users are going to be most interested in
recent activity on their blog when they log in (i.e. recent posts,
recent comments)."

Gotta agree on this one. I think it's *very* likely that your own blog 
is more important that the 'recent happnings' out in the WP'sphere. (Add 
my personal greivance to this that if you haven't logged in for a while, 
the updating process for the dashboard page makes it take 10-30 seconds 
to go from clicking "Login" to actually seeing the page.)





"Implement a ?theme package? system,"

I think that is in the works...





"Include a photo gallery feature in the default installation to
allow novice users to publish their photos easily."

No. This a blog. No a photoblog. Not a gallery. If anything the "Upload" 
section could do with a better file browser so that people could upload 
images, browse through, pick one, copy/paste the url for it.





"It is not possible to create a new category when writing a
new post."

++ Bugged me for a while. Just a single textarea at the end of the 
category list would do the trick. But definately needed.





"When listing posts, the post ID is the first column in the
table. This is not very useful information to help users
scan the table. Show the name of the post in the first
column of the table."

But don't take the post-id away, I do actually use that as a reference 
once in a while.






Ok then, all done.

Jeff

Hyperlinks?
Issues

Links to different kinds of content are handled in a uniform
way throughout WordPress. Links to external content or sites,
online help and post / page content are all represented as
underlined blue text, and all links open in the parent browser
window. Sometimes, system actions are carried out using
blue underlined text links (such as activation of a theme). This
design both make it difficult for users to determine the purpose and 
effect of these links, and is likely to cause
frustration when supporting content is displayed in place of
the WordPress application itself. Most users would expect
supporting content to be displayed in a window outside the
application itself (much like help content is displayed in a
separate window on desktop applications).

Disagree with the implication that users want more popup/separate 
windows.  It's pretty well established that's the last thing they want. 
  (Hint: The Web is not a "desktop application".)  People avoid sites 
that indulge in this kind of behavior, they certainly don't want it on 
their own sites.

* Differentiate links that provide access to help content.
   Instead of linking the text of field labels, place a
   hyperlinked question mark either after the label or after the
   field (e.g. ?(?)?. This makes the purpose of the link clear.

Actually, I think that change would only add confusion, not reduce it, 
by appearing to be a standard "Add page to Wiki" link.  Wiki is not the 
obscure thing it once was, and is becoming less so rather quickly.

Navigation Design
Issues
The second level tabs (i.e. the menu options presented below
the primary navigation options) are an efficient use of screen
real estate, but can be hard to notice (see example below).
Users may not realize there are multiple options available
below a major menu item.
Recommendation

? Enlarge the font size on the second level tabs, and give
the font more visual weight (e.g. use color and bolding).

Someone else said it before.  "Learning Curve".  Making WordPress easy 
for newbies should not have to mean long-term sacrifice for its users 
for that sake.  That real estate is a precious resource.  (The 
appropriate way to fix this for the visually impaired is with a local 
stylesheet override.)

Actually, I can see the usefulness of having things lead to help 
sections. EG:

Post Title (?)
-----------------------------------
|                                 |
-----------------------------------

Post Excerpt {?}
-----------------------------------
|                                 |
-----------------------------------

The (?) being a link to the appropriate help page. This implementation 
is very clear and quite obvious what's going to happen when you click.

However, even this excellent solution will quite quickly clutter the 
page up with a lot of ugly little question mark links.

Perhaps something like "Nifty-titles.js" could be employed to create 
tooltips for inline help. Something along those lines then - would allow 
new users to get a quick "what's what" on the page by hovering elements, 
but wouldn't clutter the page up for more advanced users.

Hi All,

Thanks for your comments about the PDF format of the report. 

Originally the draft report was intended just for Matt's eyes and
feedback before release to a broader audience. His lack of time
availability meant that we decided to release more generally, but I
overlooked the doc format issue at the time.

Anyway, there's now a PDF version online
(www.gabrielwhite.com/wordpress/) in addition to the Word version (I'm
more than happy for you to write comments directly into the Word
version with version tracking if that's the way you prefer to edit
docs collaboratively, otherwise just let me know your thoughts in
plain text email).

Cheers,

Hi Ron,

(sorry this might not attach to the proper thread, I subscribed to
this list after the post was made)

Let me address the points that you've made:

1. Disagree with the implication that users want more popup/separate
windows.  It's pretty well established that's the last thing they
want.

People don't avoid sites that use popups in a useful constructive,
predictable way. They avoid sites that use popups to present content
that they don't want or need in an obstructive intrusive or disruptive
way (ie pop up advertisements).

The key issue with my recommendation here is around control.

When you're designing a software UI, it's important that users have
control over what happens with the software where they want or need
it.

The problem with the current UI is that it completely replacies the
"application view" in the browser with "online help" when you access
help content.

One effect of this is that users have to use the browser's Back button
to get back to where they were. Which is generally okay in the context
of an information site, but not good in the context of a web
application (think: do you ever press the back button when you're
using GMail, Hotmail or Yahoo Mail?). But in the context of a web
application, this is definitely a loss of control.

I wouldn't have such big qualms about replacing the application view
with help content if there was just one general help link on the page
(which is much more visually and conceptually separated from the rest
of the application UI). But with integrated contextual help, it's
important that the help behaves in a more application-like way (ie
users should not use the back button).

Also, people often read help along-side the task they are trying to
get assistance with, which the current design does not support very
well.

Also, when people use WordPress (or any web app), they are focussed on
actually using that application. But if in the process of invoking
support documentation, the application iteself entirely disappeared
users will most likely become slightly concerned that they've lost
work or logged out or something like that (even if it's not an
explicit concern). Having a pop-up in this context makes is much more
comforting: the user hasn't lost their application or their work, AND
they have the help available to them.

Overall, it's just a better experience.

2. Visually differentiating different links.

Expectations is important. When I do something on a computer I should
know beforehand eactly what effect my action is going to have on the
system. One of the problems with the web is that (when badly
designed), everything looks the same, so (for example) users can't
predict whether a link's going a) give them a short definition of a
concept b) go to a big article about the topic c) go to a completely
different web site d) let them buy a book about the concept. Ofthen
they just click and hope.

So, the best way to help people in this regard is to give them clear
cues about what the effect of clicking on a link is going to be. So
it's important to differentiate the different kinds of things that a
link can do, and then give the user the cues that they need to tell
beforehand what's going to happen.

Maybe the particular suggestion I made for the design solution to this
should be reconsidered, but I still stand by the recommendation to
differentiate the links.

3. Making WordPress easy for newbies should not have to mean long-term
sacrifice for its users for that sake.

First, I'm not sure screen real estate is actually a significant
issue. 65%+ of people have 1024x768 or higher. And given that WP users
are likely to be more technical, they're also more likely to have high
res screens. Increasing the visual weight of the menu may only mean a
few pixels lost.

http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp

Second, this isn't just for newbies. Visual design (using colour,
shading, font, etc) makes it easier for everyone to use the
application. A well designed application doesn't require you to
remember how to do things; the design makes it immediately obvious
what you are doing, how to do it and what else can be done. So while
increasing the visual weight of these elements will help newbies
identify functions more easily, it will also help reduce the ambient
mental load for more experienced people who don't need to spend the .2
seconds thinking about how to get to a piece of functionality: the
visual design means that the elements are already mentally present
without requiring explicit attention.

Look at how GMail uses a very sophisticated set of subtle visual cues
to help you differentiate and structure the information on the screen.
Even though you might be an expert user, the visual cues means you can
just DO things immediately without even a small moment of reflection.

So, again the experience is better.

I'm in Beijing at the moment, and then back home visiting Australia
next week, so real time discussions just ain't gonna happen because of
the time differences. But I'll endeavour to follow up once a day on
any discussion here.

Cheers,

Gabe

I think it's important for people who use wordpress regularly (ie not
me) to define this IA. The two most important considerations are

1) Conceptual clarity. Can people find what they want, is it organised
in a logical way?
2) Efficiency. Are the things I use most often visible at the top,
less frequest things less often?

It's a balancing act with these two goals, but if you use those to
guide the decision process, then you'll be fine. Do you have an
alternative proposal for the IA?

The important thing here is to make them meaningful rather than
abstract concepts you need to refer to the manual to remind yourself
what they mean. Again, I'm open to other suggestions.

Hi Jeff,

I've put my comments below.

I can see that. If there's no better alternative, then leave it as is.

Icons are great when used carefully and sparingly. That could be very useful.

I can understand why you might say that, but the question is not so
much about what WP "is" in any conceptual sense, but rather how people
actually use it (it is for this exact same reason PowerPoint has an
in-built org-chart making feature because that's what a lot of people
actually use the software for).

And if you're looking to ease the newbie use curve, then inbuilt photo
publishing would be a really useful feature for those users given what
novices typically do with the software. Advanced users could just
uninstall it.

Everyone's happy.

Definitely agree on that one.

Hi Jeff,

I very much like the idea of the nifty-titles approach.

Cheers,

Gabe


Actually, I can see the usefulness of having things lead to help 
sections. EG:

Post Title (?)
-----------------------------------
|                                 |
-----------------------------------

Post Excerpt {?}
-----------------------------------
|                                 |
-----------------------------------

The (?) being a link to the appropriate help page. This implementation 
is very clear and quite obvious what's going to happen when you click.

However, even this excellent solution will quite quickly clutter the 
page up with a lot of ugly little question mark links.

Perhaps something like "Nifty-titles.js" could be employed to create 
tooltips for inline help. Something along those lines then - would allow 
new users to get a quick "what's what" on the page by hovering elements, 
but wouldn't clutter the page up for more advanced users.

Line 84 of wp-admin/index.php:
<p>There are currently <?php echo $numposts ?> <a href="edit.php"
title="posts">posts</a> and <?php echo $numcomms ?> <a
href="edit-comments.php" title="Comments">comments</a>, contained within

I'm just now looking into i18n for my own plugins, so forgive me if this
is obvious and/or wrong:
Shouldn't the above (indeed, all text in wp-admin/*) be wrapped in __()
or _e() for translation?  Seems like the above could very easily be
broken into seperate strings.

You must have an old version you are looking at -- the current one
has this:

<p><?php printf(__('There are currently %1$s <a href="%2$s" title="Posts">posts</a> and %3$s <a href="%4$s" title="Comments">comments</a>, contained within %5$s <a href="%6$s" title="categories">categories</a>.'), $numposts, 'edit.php',  $numcomms, 'edit-comments.php', $numcats, 'categories.php'); ?></p>

Great, another artifact of the "multiple 1.5 released without indicating
that anything changed between releases".

For 1.5.1, can any changes to the released file be indiciated by some
sub-version number (1.5.1a, 1.5.1b) so that we can all know with clarity
which version we're dealing with?

1.5 was official released February 17:
   http://wordpress.org/development/2005/02/strayhorn/

It's been established that several different versions of the download
files had been posted, with nothing to indicate anything had changed.
Those who downloaded on February 17 had a different file from those who
downloaded later.  The only way we were able to determine this in
#wordpress was to compare md5sums of the zip files, after realizing that
the line numbers in our respective files weren't matching up content-wise.
(I believe the discussion I had was with MCIncubus; though others
probably participated that I've forgotten.)

According to the list in the trac link above, wp-admin localization
didn't occur until after 1.5's official release.  If it was rolled back
into 1.5's official distribution (as suggested by Kimmo), there's
nothing to indicate that.

The point I was -- and _am_ -- making is that for 1.5.1, I'd like to
make sure that subsequent changes to the published download archive(s)
get _recorded_ somehow, preferably with a version bump, so we can all
speak with clarity as to _which_ release we downloaded.

Noticed that too. It would be nice if there was an option to generate code 
which displays a thumbnail which links to the full size image.

I don't see why the Thumbnail option is even there. I asked in 
#wordpress and the advice was "use a plugin".
I checked the Option, uploaded an image and looked in the upload 
directory - no thumbnail. Which leads me to think that something is very 
broken, but maybe because plugins are covering it, no big noise is being 
made.
Cut that option out or make it work ?

The download was modified before the release announcement, it nothing in 
the release archive was changed afterward. There were some changes in 
the archive before the 17th, which wasn't ideal, just clearing up the 
factual inaccuracies.

Kimmo didn't suggest that, and you could download to see for yourself. I 
think his comment "You must have an old version you are looking at" was 
referring that people usually check the latest SVN before suggesting 
there is a bug, to save time for all involved in case it's already been 
fixed. We don't expect people to always run the latest, but there's a 
nice browser where you can check things with a few clicks:

Based on the subject, I thought you were talking about 1.5.1.

As said in that Usability review, the image uploading functionality in
WordPress is seriously lacking. It would be really nice to have a proper
photo management gallery type thing.

In my case a thumbnail gets created fine, even though wp is silent about it. 
I didn't actually figure out about it untill I accidently checked in 
wp-content folder. This is a useless case to me since I wasn't told that the 
thumbnail was created nor was I given an option to use that thumbnail.

I think the whole "user levels" concept is a little odd, to be honest. 
It's great because of its simplicity, but I think it's far too inflexible.

I would much rather see "user permission groups" that could be custom 
named (hence meeting your requirement). Each "group" would have a slew 
of permission check boxes that could be setup by the admin. Users would 
be placed in whatever 'group' is appropriate.



Additionally, I'm not sure it's really such a bad idea to force people 
to look up what a user "3" can and can't do. If you've got an admin who 
see's "manager, level 2" and doesn't realize that they can (potentially) 
turn on/off plugins, that would be a problem as well. Basically, it 
would (as with 'post slug') be difficult to aptly -- and concisely -- 
name the user levels without possibly misleading, or under-informing the 
admin of the user level power.

I would lean towards making sure that Admins (the only group who can 
really change user level) actually know quite distinctly what they are 
doing -- even if they do need to look it up.



But again, this is moot as I think the whole 'levels' concept is due to 
be replaced.

There is only one 1.5 release, but here and on lolyglots mailing list

The .POT file would have to have that line translated also.

Too bad there was no tag created for it.  Else we could tell what was 
going on.  I hope 1.5.1 is different:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch04s06.html

Then version control would be maintaining a true history that nobody
could argue about.  In addition, it allows people to easily check out
that specific version and devlop patches against it.

Message-ID: <1113855226.426414fa668af@80.253.99.25>


i think it would be interesting to add a plugin hook on the entire query string
immediately before the query occurs, in addition to the results. the best i
found at the moment was to use a 1 = 0 where clause to bypass the wordpress
query, and to use the the_posts hook to toss in the results of a new query done
"the right way".

I think it translates fine with poEdit.  It works in my Finnish
WordPress installations.

I did build a new pot file at one point, when the official one was
behind.  I'm not sure which one is more recent, but you could try
and compare the pot file in fi_FI to see if it makes a difference.

I don't think it will make any difference, though.

Btw, we need trac or something similar for the i18n repo!!  :-)

Hi Jamie--

I've run into a problem with Singular: it overwrites any selected post 
slug with the generated slug from the post title.

I'm looking at 3 possible solutions:

1. Check for $_POST['post_name'] which should still be around. (I think 
this is best)
2. Retrieve both post_name and post_title and compare them before 
overwriting - could be complicated.
3. Retrieve post_name and do some regex to see if the last digit is a 
number, yada-yada-yada.

I'm going to implement #1 as #2 and 3 seem like poor solutions to me. 
Perhaps the rest of you have better ideas?

Cheers,
--Alex

I stand corrected.  I should've browsed the repository itself instead of 
just using the Trac browser.....  Which I see has now been updated to 
also show the tags directory.  Or maybe the tags directory was just 
created.

Regardless: Woo.  Yes, Woo.

Thanks Ryan.

I just created it after your reminder.  When 1.5 was released we were still on CVS.
After we imported to svn we never got around to adding a tag.  Luckily, tagging an old
repository version is very simple in svn.

I wrote a comment on queries here, I still think it's relevant:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-March/000305.html

Yes, they do take a small amount of time, and while timing script
either with php or xdebug shows them to spent little time, ab shows
that removing redundant very simple queries still makes a more than
measurable difference. Getting rid of ~10 very simple and small
SELECTs in Textpattern (after the initial benchmarks I did) showed an
improvement of ~12% in execution time, even though they showed to use
less than 1% of execution time. If mysql is on the same server every
cpu cycle that is not used by mysql can be used by php , otherwise
you'll benefit from avoiding network latency and the like.

Some of the things I point to in my above post are really not hard to
do, they are low hanging fruit why not pick them?

Another place to look at, would be the application of filters, even
without any plugins the code spends quiet a bit of time with that
(very many iterations), maybe somebody wants to try different
approaches to that while measruring with XDebug.

Yes, WP-Cache is really good (I think it needs more publicity ;)). But
the numbers only give cache hits. Usually there will also be a bit of
commenting going on, and with every comment the whole cache is being
flushed. If you have a comment-spammer running bots on you, using or
not using WP-Cache at may not make a difference, at worst create more
overhead.

Nice one Ryan!

On the same note can I make this general plea on behalf of those of us who try and provide live support in #wordpress
as the new version is released.

1.5 appeared on the download page before being announced on the dev blog - the download subsequently changed a number
of times and deciding what version someone had was not easy - this late bug fixing was not very transparanet and not
very helpful!

I understand the need and desire to get some early end user feedback on the actual release before advertising it to
the masses - but changing the download multiple times wasn't nice!  Can I suggest a simple method of avoiding this the
next time round:

When the devs feel that 1.5.1 is ready for release tag and package a release candidate - e.g. wp-1.5.1-rc1 and add
this to the download page alongside the current release with a note to say that that it is a release candidate for the
next release and is hopefully bug free - as the early user easy win bug fixes come in and are fixed new release
candidates wp-1.5.1-rc2, wp-1.5.1-rc3 etc can be tagged and packaged.

Then once you are happy that you have a golden final final 1.5.1 release tag the wp-1.5.1 release and package uplod
and announce.

This ensures that we don't have multiple versions floating around claiming to be the same thing!

And makes it transparent to the people helping solve install etc problems exactly what files someone has got!

Cheers

Absolutely! 
May I also suggest that the download be named something other than
latest.zip/latest.tar.gz? Because then one 'latest' looks exactly the
same as another! I ended up with 2 version of latest.zip and one
latst.tar.gz all different sizes and no idea which was the one to use.

I understand about keeping a consistent url, but perhaps use Apache
re-write to 302 to the real one eg.
Redirect seeother /latest.zip  
http://wordpress.org/downloads/wordpress-1.5-strayhorn.zip

Redirect seeother /latest.tar.gz  
http://wordpress.org/downloads/wordpress-1.5-strayhorn.tar.gz

Alex,

Yep, you're right, there was no checking to see if a post-name had been
specified.  Your solution is best, and only adds one line before the
post-name replacement replacement:

if ($specified = $_REQUEST['post_name']) return $id;

or somesuch.  Probably don't even need the assignment statement really.
 I think this should cover it:  Do nothing when the user has specified
the post-name themselves and assume they know what they're doing,
otherwise just sanitise the post title as usual.  Like you say, the
other two solutions seem a bit of an overkill.

Cheers for the info!

Jamie.

Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. The post_name value gets the same 
"uniquifying" treatment even if you specify it manually. We need to go 
ahead and use the value in $_POST['post_name'] if it exists.

function singular_post($id) {
	global $wpdb;
	if(!isset($id)) $id = $_REQUEST['post_ID'];
	if (!empty($_POST['post_name'])) {
		$slug = sanitize_title($_POST['post_name'], $id);	}
	else {
		$post_title = $wpdb->get_var("
			SELECT post_title
			FROM {$wpdb->posts}
			WHERE ID = '{$id}'
			LIMIT 1
		");
		$slug = sanitize_title($post_title, $id);	
	}
	$wpdb->query("
		UPDATE {$wpdb->posts}
		SET post_name = '$slug'
		WHERE ID = '{$id}'
		LIMIT 1
	");
	return $id;
}

Also, I added a call to the plugin on edit as well:

add_action('publish_post', 'singular_post', 8);
add_action('edit_post', 'singular_post', 8);

Cheers,

It's been a week.  A fair number of bugs have been squashed.

I don't think anyone expects 1.5.1 to fix _all_ bugs.

I'd like to see a release candidate packaged up.  If no show-stopper
bugs are reported, the release candidate can be re-tagged as 1.5.1
final, and bug fixing can continue into 1.5.2 or 1.6, or whatever.

Or is there something significant holding up the point release?

The reason we have the /latest name is to make it easy for people 
scripting the WP install. It does have a rule that you can put the 
version number in there if you want, like /latest-1.5.tar.gz, and it'll 
work. When you download through a browser it does send the correct file 
name, using

header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=blah.zip');

Which seems to work everywhere but linux command line tools.

Yes. There are a few remaining bugs that are important and some larger 
website tie-ins that aren't finished yet. Also, following the recent 
problems that have come up with MT, I am re-reviewing and auditing parts 
of the code that touch the database and send out mail.

Is the inclusion of the auto-save not going to delay release, and is 
there an option to switch this off ?

Given the way that people may also come to depend on this, I can't help 
thinking that such a 'feature' should be subject to much wider testing 
than in a .1 release.

Not that it's a big issue (though I've found it a pain myself), but why
not use an HTTP redirect, which would work everywhere?

I had the same initial thought.

Upon deactivating all of the plugins on my dev site, and upon trying to change
the number of posts to display in feeds, though, the problem remained:

- Only one post is ever sent by /feed/
- Nothing was returned by /cats/blog/feed/

'was', as in when one of my subscribers notified me of the problem. At the
moment, one post is returned /cats/blog/feed/

i'll look it up sooner or later.

Yeah, I'd like to hear the justification for this. This should have
been postponed until after 1.5.1. We're at the stage where features
should be frozen and all efforts put into fixing bugs, no?

There is strong effort being put into fixing bugs, as you can see from
the rest of the timeline Dave diplomatically chose not to highlight.
Historically, people do not upgrade for fixes to bugs they don't
experience and api hooks. There are no known security issues to fix in
this release either. If Restore causes too much trouble it'll be backed
out, but if not it'll provide a nice feature we can point to encourage
people to upgrade. There have also been usability, speed, and
optimization improvements -- get over it. My goal is to provide the best
possible experience for our users, not adhere to someone's idea of what
the "rules" are for releases.

A good target for 1.5.1 is May 3rd, which could change, but just please
stop the berating. It's unproductive and rude, and there are plenty of
more positive ways to contribute to the community.

On the contrary, I think that the abundance of bugfixes led dr Dave
and myself to believe that we were in full bugfixing mode, and that
all new features should be postponed. That was my reading, anyway.

Fair enough, that makes sense.

I wasn't trying to be rude, just wondering why a non-bugfix appeared
in a timeline full of bugfixes. I realise the misunderstanding and
your justification, so all I can offer is my apologies for sounding
rude.

I don't think I was in the least implying that huge efforts haven't 
been made in bug-fixing. Quite the opposite actually: I was merely 
wondering aloud why, while the consensus seemed to be on doing a final 
round of bug-fixing over the impressive number of previous bug-fixing 
already done, the timeline suddenly showed an addition that has little 
to do with bug-fixing.

For the record, the main reason I ended up checking that particular 
timeline, was a sudden general falling-apart of the SVN code I was 
running on miscellaneous installs (and I have absolutely no evidence 
that there is a direct link, but there's definitely a chronological 
correlation).

Adding features to encourage users to upgrade certainly sounds like a 
valid idea to me. And I, for one, want nothing more than an auto-save 
feature built-into WordPress. But why not informing us of this decision 
before, as it seems it went quite directly opposite the direction of 
all that's been said, or let said, over the past few days on the topic 
of 1.5.1 upgrade.

It was in no way my intent to be rude, while I admit my last comment 
certainly incorporated a certain element of cheekiness to it, I hardly 
consider it on a level worthy of the "berating" label.

Now, if I may say, why wasn't this element of answer formulated before? 
Perhaps it would have been helpful in avoiding any temptation among the 
more feeble minds among us, to veer into that seemingly redundant line 
of questioning, that might be seen as rude or unproductive, under a 
certain angle, I guess...

Sincerely,

It can be used by plugins for caching expensive post content 
transformations.

Sounds like a good idea indeed. I was just surprised to find no hook anywhere to
call it in the WordPress code. At the moment, the only occurence of it is in the
install script.

I would have imagined finding something somewhere like:

if ( $post->post_content_filtered )
  // bypass post_content filters

and like:

apply_filters( wherever_relevant, update_post_content_filtered )

at other places. But leave as is, I presume, as there is room to cache things
differently from a site to another.

Speaking of which: If I make a plugin to fill the field every so often on a
semi-static basis rather than on a per-modification basis, is there a way to I
disable the apply_filters call on the_content altogether?

I have used it to apply all "the_content" filters to the content and 
then store the filtered output.  This is what TextPattern does (or did, 
last time I checked).  Some filters are VERY expensive to run realtime.  
Textile 2 in PHP is a monster... so much so that your main page or 
monthly archives may refuse to load on some servers.  So what you can do 
is have the Textile 2 filter run when you edit or publish an entry, and 
then you'll just directly output the processed content.

I did some work on a plugin that someone wrote last year that did this:

http://persson.cx/archives/2004/06/15/prerendering-in-wordpress/

If you're running Textile 2 or another expensive text-processing engine, 
it could make your pages load a lost faster.

Actually, it's a bit more complex:

I've Markdown running and indeed it is a hogger. But I've also a smart link
plugin in beta test on my site.

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/smart-link/

It is even more a hogger than Markdown. :P And I expect two more plugins in my
pipe will make things even worse.

I suspect your plugin will introduce more problems than it solves in my case. I
would need to use the_prerendered_content() instead of the_content() in my
theme, and assume other plugin users will do the same -- I suspect this is too
complex for most users.

Thus, I'd be curious to know if someone has some code available that traverses
the the_content filter, adds a caching trigger at the end of it, and triggers
the caching during shutdown. If not, I guess I'm in for another plugin...

Wget is the only one I use, I never learned curl. It identifies itself
as Wget/1.9.1
where the version number could change. 
It is possible to make it send another user agent string, but then all
bets are off if you do that anyway.

I've just tried lynx and it does correctly honour the content
disposition header.

I don't know of any others.

If you call the_prerendered_content() on a post with no cached content, 
it will apply the filters right then and cache the content live.  The 
performance is identical to running the filters live, with the 
difference being that subsequent loads would use the cached content, 
which is much faster.  Having to modify the theme is a necessary evil, 
at least the way I saw it.  I've tried plugins that run as a filter on X 
and then try to modify filters on X live, and it really doesn't work so 
well.

I'd be all for having the options in the admin on whether or not to cache, 
and a button to clear the cache (and a hook for plugins to do so if they're 
applying other filters). The default set of the_content and such could load 
the cached content if the option is enabled in the admin.

I was just discussing the following workflow with J?r?me Lavign?:


on display post: -- sem_smart_cache_display()

- plugin hook at priority 1 on the_content detects if cache needs an update
(e.g. older than 24h)

if no cache update is necessary:

- make a copy of the_content filter array, traverse the_content filter array,
remove all filters, add a sem_no_smart_cache filter at the end of the array;
return post_content_filtered
- at sem_no_smart_cache(), restore the the_content filter array for use by the
next post; return as normal

if cache update is necessary:

- make a copy of the_content filter array, traverse the_content filter array and
add a sem_do_smart_cache filter at the end of the array; return post_content
- at sem_do_smart_cache(), do to_smart_cache[$ID]=$post_content and restore the
the_content filter array for use by the next post; return as normal


on edit/publish: -- sem_smart_cache_save()

- apply_filters to the content and do to_smart_cache[$ID]=$post_content, but be
wary
of disabling the priority 1 filter first to avoid strange behaviors


on shutdown: -- sem_smart_cache_shutdown()

- at 'shutdown' hook, we can safely do the sql inserts without bothering the
user with delays


this workflow requires no particular action by the user -- as opposed to
replacing the the_content() call in a template. the only requirement is some
rigor, a time stamp in the post metas, and perhaps an option (number of hours
between each update).


for comments, straightforward caching with no refresh is obviously the right
thing to do.


One downside: There is potential for huge bugs if another plugin is modifying
the the_content loop as well. I'll live with it risk. ;)

Matt, please don't overlook the fact that almost everyone who has
pestered you on this list about 1.5.1 are active, continuous
contributors to the development community if nothing else. All I need is
a date so I can plan development on plugins accordingly (I just cannot
do lots of things until that options page bug is fixed in a release) and
tell users that they can expect to wait until such-and-such a point. As
you're fond of saying, we're all volunteers. We're all putting our
personal time into this. It's just a matter of courtesy to let us know
what to expect.

Nobody knows whether it's 'coming' in 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 7 days, four
months. The only other instinct in the abscene of this information is to
try to speed up whatever needs to get done, and it leads to things like
nitpicking on changesets.

All I ask -- and, may I suggest, at least 90% of other people pestering
you about release dates -- all we ask is for is a timeline, however
shifty, however unsure, so that we have a common reference point. Nobody
will blame anyone if it slides by a few weeks here and there. For
example, just being told that it's scheduled for early May (and not
earlier, or late next month, or something) made things about 100% better
for my planning.

Let's not get distracted by he said she said, the point is that WP needs
a timeline and some acknowledgement from you or rboren that a
roadmap/timeline is an issue that will be tended to will be wonderful.
And it doesn't have to be an extensive thing either, just next-release
based.

fetch springs to mind.

It's still not clear to me why you can't just use an HTTP redirect.

A quick curl lesson:

   curl -I [url] gives the header info...

   curl -o strayhorn.tar.gz http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

That's about 99% of my curl usage.

Oh, I'm using curl 7.10.8 (powerpc-apple-darwin7.2.0) libcurl/7.10.8

I thought I should point out that e.g. t.dk is a valid domain, and
I believe they have single letter email addresses...  So requiring

Subject: [wp-hackers] Moving the Project Forward
Message-ID: <4266AA67.7010907@skippy.net>

Per Matt's comments in #wordpress yesterday, I created:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/Release_Philosophy

There's been a lot of discussion (positive and negative) about recent
goings-on.  I've been party to both sides of the debate.  The question
gets floated more and more now: why doesn't more authority get
delegated?  And as much fun as it can be to bitch and complain, I'm
ultimately much more interested in finding positive solutions, and
moving forward.

As I see things, WordPress has reached a rather important stage in its
development cycle -- a stage which many Open Source projects go through.
 We have a large body of interested participants, eager to help make
WordPress better than it is.  A lot of people want to exert influence
(for good or ill); and the perception is that Matt is keeping a tight
grasp on the reins (which is his right, if he so chooses).

This is, in the end, a good problem to have.  It means that WordPress is
doing a lot of things "right"; enough so to attract and (so far) keep
our interest.

But we're now approaching a delicate situation.  Matt clearly has a
strong vision for WordPress' future.  Unfortunately, that vision has not
yet been clearly articulated to many of us, so we feel consternation at
what looks to be arbitrary rejection of our ideas (and we obviously
think our ideas are good ideas, else we wouldn't put them forward).

I hope the link above gets filled out in such a way as to help us
understand the principles driving a "successful" WordPress release.  The
current release model is alien to many of us -- some of whom have been
key participants in other Open Source projects, and approach WordPress
with expectations born from these other projects.

Case in point: Matt said "If we have to add an option for [AutoSave],
then we've failed."  That drew gasps from #wordpress.  I understand (and
appreciate -- indeed _celebrate_) WordPress' commitment to end-user
convenience, but that comment struck me, at least, as extremely
unrealistic.  Clearly Matt meant something by that comment, and I think
his meaning was missed by us, to the detriment of all: us because we
feel bewilderment at what sounds like pie-in-the-sky dreaming; Matt
because his passion and vision are not being shared by people who could
help realize it; and the project as a whole because these
misunderstandings affirm the suspicion that this is "Matt's project"
through and through.

A lot of pariticpants here are used to project timelines, milestones,
release candidates, and the like.  I think most (if not all) of us are
open to learning new tricks; but those tricks will need to be explained
to us.

In closing: please do not read malicious intent into anything in this
mail.  I am deeply interested in seeing WordPress thrive; and I'm eager
to do what I can to facilitate that.

I'd like to jump in and help with bugfixes.   I created a Mosquito 
account, but never got the confirmation, so I must have borked it.  
Could some one destroy the "apakuni" account or be sure it is pointing 
at apakuni@ursastudios.com.

Then, what is required for me to make SVN commits?

The philosophy behind this has been discussed a number of times.

Testers is the list for nightly builds, and only testers.

Should be fixed in the latest revision.

I think I found in the mosquito site where it sets that charset and 
changed it to utf-8. Let me know if you have any more probs. When the 
bugtracker is on Trac we won't have login issues anymore, as it'll be 
synced with the forums.

Well, you can't... directly.  That appears to be a right you have to 
earn... so if it is ever bestowed upon me, I'll let you know how I did 
it. ;-)

The best thing to do is to upload working, tested patches at 
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/

I've had Ryan commit some of my patches within the hour.

It appears to have been the JavaScript autosave code, which has been

Is there an identified need you feel I'd be qualified to address?

I read the links Ryan posted, and feel better informed now about the 
default mentality surrounding the WordPress development process; but 
it'll still take me awhile to fully internalize it.

I'm willing to volunteer in several capacities:
* publishing and maintaining a list of release-blocking bugs
* publishing and maintaining a list of projected release milestones
* publishing and maintaining a list of pending enhancements, and their 
tentative schedule for inclusion
* liason between developers and documenters, to ensure deprecated items 
get flagged appropriately, and their replacements highlighted
* mascot

If this means that we get to dress you up in a chicken suit and make you 
hold developer press conferences... I think it's your moral obligation 
to do so.

	I've only spent a few minutes looking at the code that uses this 
(wp-includes/functions-post.php) so please correct me if I'm wrong.  My 
reading of the code seems to indicate that any comment can now 
instantly be approved (skipping checks used to prevent spam) simply by 
using the URL that the WP install is running on.  If that is the case 
then I suggest that this is a really bad idea and will likely be 
exploited by spammers.

	Again, I've only briefly looked through the code so there may be a 
filter or some other component that prevents.  I hope that is the case.

It appears to only be for trackbacks or pingbacks, not regular 
comments.  For Pingback, it doesn't really matter, since Pingbacks are 
verified to be valid links.  For Trackbacks, I doubt a spammer would 
spam you with a URI from your own site.  What's the benefit?

It's only for trackbacks and pingbacks, in which the only link is the 
source URI. It compares the domain of the source URI to the blog's URI.

The add_action() function is defined like this:

function add_action($tag, $function_to_add, $priority = 10, $accepted_args = 1)

The $accepted_args argument specifies how many arguments your function
accepts.  It will be passed no more than that many when do_action()
calls it.

There are a couple of strings in the URI's that cannot be translated

    /page/

Would it be possible to add these to wp-admin/options-permalink.php

In terms of the Support Forums, I think a model similar to the
SpywareInfo Forums <http://forums.spywareinfo.com/> might work better;
award people that give regular and reliable help. This will not only
make people more keen to help out (for the status and recognition), but
it will instill confidence in the users having trouble, because they
know they are being helped by someone who is at least partly "qualified".

http://forums.spywareinfo.com/index.php?showtopic=9270 has an
explanation of the user groups at SWI. We don't really need a full-blown
"training ground" for people to learn how to help out, instead, people
could enlist as a "Training Support Technician", and have, say, 10 of
their posts reviewed. If it's good advice, then they'd become a "Support
Technician", if not, they'd be given suggestions on where they went
wrong and can try again.

Just an idea...

Jon

Matt,

I can answer partly as a user (i'm not a developper).

WP est great ok.. that OK but ..

But it is great IF you are pleased with the "out of the box" install.
If it's not the case, the newcomer to WP will find :

1) to much places to look for
-----------------------------------
As soon a s you want to make it do something else you have to struggle a lot.
Evene for people (like me) who the time passing by start to know
rather well the "WP community" it's sometimes difficult to find
something.

There are plug ins : ok.. but everywhere
There are themes: OK but everywhere
There are support sites: ok but every were (i'm lost between the code,
the various plug ins repositories and so on)

2) lack of official endorsement for basic extensions
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you find something (plug in or theme) the main question is : is
it compatible with my version of WP ?


Result
-------

I think a basic user  wants in a single place :
1- the software
2- the basic extensions (themes, plug ins)

If this was done a lot of comments this kind could be avoided

My two cents

Hi matt, hi list,

as I'm quite in the theme part, I'll just  deal with that one.
The way themes are done now is quite good because we now have user
defined themes since 1.5. However, theme designers still have to know
PHP to use it.
Changing to smarty (http://smarty.php.net would improve it a lot but
it would also require a heavy work to set up.
Maybe a real well designed doc about themes and functionnalities, not
spread amongst many wiki pages would really be a plus I guess, even if
people who can't read php will still have problem.
An example: I have recently discovered the 'li_title=' in some
functions because I had to have a llok at the code. End users who want
to change their themes may not have to do it.

For the plugin part, I guess wordpress is moving really quick, and
plugin developpers may not have the time to adapt their work so their
plugin way not work anymore, without a single alarm on wp-plugins.net.
The lack of documentation is also a real and well known problem as
developpers susually don't like to write them down and can't think as
end users to guess what would be needed.
And most end users don't read docs. I know that too.

As wordpress is becoming more and more known and used, it will also
need to become more and more 'click and play'. It means activating
things like comments, linkroll, archives and so from the admin pannel
and not by commenting a PHP function. This will also cause some
trouble for developpers.
As an example, SPIP is an incredibly user friendlyh CMS, but
incredibly heavy to use too. Even my wife can install and manage one,
but it needs a lot of things to be done to work the way you want.
Wordpress is a little more tricky to tune, but its use is incredibly
simple. I guess we need to get the balance between those 2.

Well as a conclusion, I think we shhould ask totally
developping-unaware end users to see the most common encountered
problems and focus on them as a way to improuve our beloved CMS.
My 2 cents, and sorry for my crappy English.
Frederic / neuro

Community and software cn be improved in several ways, but i think
that comment was unfair, yes you have to manage PHP if you really want
make tricky things but i think that 90% of tasks already can be done
by people that are able to manage theyr webhosting, FTP, and know
HTML. Plugins are a lot and cover almost everything (some better than
other but they does and doensn't require so much PHP coding).

Having a template language would help? I don't think it would, why to
learn a template language and not use the standards? I think the 2 way
to improve user expirience are about the SW and the community, with
this one intended as support community and plugin and theme developper
too.

Sw:

1) we have recentrly started a therad about iadmin interface usability
and there there is some good thing that can be done
2) adding pages maybe should have added a tab menu in the default
theme too, menus are the first request people ask
3)adding some "essential" plugin part of the core of WP would improve
the sw a lot. I'm thinking about photo gallery, statistics etc. I
think that for the 1.6 or 2.0 version an end user survey about what
features end user would like to see in future realese would be
helpfull.

About Community:

I don't agree that support forum is so unusefull as that article says,
i find lot of answer, for tech people and people used to old forum
methods the actual limit of bbpress are not blocking them, but thre is
a lot of works to give "normal" user a nice expirience using it.

a) Make the forum improved in usalbility and strss about the fact that
a forum is based on volonteers so any answr can come in 2 minutes, 2
hours or 2 weeks... to many people ask for immediate solutions, but i
don't thinks other  blog sw have a better support.
b) stress a lot about other source for info (codex for fist), i follow
th codex development cause i manage a WP Wiki in italian and we take a
lot from it to translate in italian, same for the forum. Having people
getting help in theyr own language help a lot non speaking and not
techy people.
c) Ask theme and plugin developper to adere to some standard in
various field, like readme file, docs, comments in the code etc, to
make easy for people dig inside. I would stress about making themes
and plugins easy to install, no PHPadmin task and minimum core code
modification, and ,aking them I18N would help make the locale teams
give more and more info, doc and stuff in mother tongue language to
end user. i.e. one of my translator for it_IT locale are making
gallery plugin and i insisted with him to realease it fully I18N, the
worst part it to get a .POT file with windows, i did it for him having
cygwin on my PC and i'm palnning to give that little but fundamental
help to everyone that lack a unix machine and doens't care to installa
that stuff. Would be nice having a sort of "WP approved logo" for
theme and plugin that meets a series of features (as the one i
exposed). In this i can give a contribution about the testing and
checking ofr localization and stuff like this.
d) soliciting all the time people to give a little putting a brick to
help to build the whole "wall". Cause i'm not a mother tongue english
speaker i didn't feel i could contribute to codex, so i decided to

I have really been wanting to post something about this for quite a
while now.  I love wordpress and I think its absolutely the best app
out there for what it does.

I have also met some extremely helpful people who have taken some time
out of their busy schedules to lend me a hand,   these people are
rare, few and far between however.

The wordpress forums are in desperate need of help. There are so many
awesome experienced coders in our community but it seems not many get
involved in the forum. I wont go into mentioning the extremely helpful
people I see on a regular basis in there, but I do go there daily and
can say that they are bearing 100% of the work and that doesnt seem
right.  I'm just starting to get into php now in a more involved way, 
as up till now I usually just tweaked things, but having a serious
desire to learn php and to help contribute to the wordpress community
thru support/plugins etc is where I am at right now.

One of the unfortunate things about the forums is that when I turn
someone new onto wordpress, or save them from the grasps of
moveabletype,  they come to the wp forums for help and come  back to
me saying, no one ever answers me, I have no idea what to do, I try to
help them if  I can or I call my best friend who is well versed in php
to help.

For me its threads like this one  
http://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=29916

that have completely discouraged me in looking to the forums for
help...in that thread I had a need, did the best job I could to
explain the problem and then in 9 more posts proceeded to talk myself
thru the problem, with only 2 responses, I later found out EXACTLY
what I needed doing a ton of searching and finding two plugins by
rboren and kafkaesqui, it was so exciting to find the answer for an
issue I've had that stopped my project development since mingus days,
only this week have I been able to continue the project.

maybe people didnt understand my problem because I wasnt able to
explain myself in a way that wp experts could understand, but thats
the reason I came to the forum- for help. The first thing I do to get
here there is to use the search in all the ways I can think of to get
an answer, then follow the link trail, then I will go to google, and
more often than not my answers will not come from the forum at all but
from other peoples sites, my last resort is to actually start a thread
in the wp forum.

2 final things,  One I can understand how a support forum for
something like wordpress is NOT easy and sometimes the questions are
not easy either and deal with alot of customization. So wp is a unique
type of forum, all the more reason for a unique support team.

Second,  I think alot of the difficult things about the wp forum are
caused by bbpress' infancy  I'm all for a standards based geeked out
forum, but it just isnt user friendly.  I applaud  the recent strong
links for unanswered posts, thats a step in the right direction.  What
I notice now, is that once a post has been replied to it frequently
drops back into the loop of forgottens.

just my 2? here

Message-ID: <030c01c5469e$ccadda90$6e01a8c0@sixfour>

To start, I want to respond to lokjah directly:

Part of the problem is having someone try to describe something textually. 
It just doesn't work.  Being unable to provide a URL makes it 
nigh-impossible for people to >easily< help.  That's just my 2c.  I 
 >couldn't< grasp what was going on.  And I'm one of the people who has 
offered up becoming a 'shadow admin' for a few days, to help people work out 
theme problems, plugin issues, simple php code, etc.  Sometimes it only 
makes sense when you see the site, sometimes it doesn't make sense until you 
see the CODE. ;)

Also, I agree with your notes about bbPress to some extent.  It's not just 
bbPress, it might also be 'categorization', having more sections to put 
questions into.  But it's missing the 'watch a thread' feature many other 
bb's have (PLEASE, don't tell me again to subscribe to an rss feed...), and 
while it 'looks nicer' than most bb's, it also fits fewer total thread 
titles on screen at once.  And yes, there's the 'bump' tendency because of a 
number of the preceding topics.

To the main topic:

I think that adding a 'templating language' is BS.  That's people thinking 
that they aren't programming, but they still are.  It just goes to slow 
things down more.

HOWEVER, the idea we've discussed previously of 'meta templates' that can 
have some sort of 'blocks' for 'what goes where', you pick a 'module', say 
where it goes (main content, left sidebar, right sidebar, header, footer, 
whatever) via a web interface and not PHP, and that'll handle a lot of 
complete non-coder issues.

Another thing to remember is that while people are running from the paid 
blog tools, they are running TO an unpaid, open-source tool.  I for one have 
put in a ton of time on plugin development and support, trying to be a 
'second hand' in the forums, but it's not my 'job'.  I don't get paid. 
There's not a staffed company running things.  Community work can get to the 
level where it can be MORE effective than a full company (i.e., linux), but 
wait, even those community projects many times have paid corporation 
employees working on modules, or committing patches, etc.  Just a different 
world.

This all comes back around to a question I asked a year ago: What does WP 
want to BE?  If it wants to be the be all end all of CSS and semantic 
publishing, it's not necessarily going to be the blog tool for the masses 
(not that one prevents the other, but...).  What is the goal?  If the goal 
IS to become a premiere blog tool, then maybe there needs to be some thought 
into what that means.  What functionality is easy in MT/et.al. that in WP is 
difficult?  What things would make WP >easy< for the non-coder?  What 
'levels' of users are there, and how do you do a good job of supporting each 
group?

Just brainstorming,

1. Like David has just said, and I too have voiced, what IS wp ? Unless 
we know that, we do not know the target and we must define that. Does it 
blog ? Does it CMS ? Does it do anything you want it to ?

2. Get people blogging that wp is NOT about PHP. We get stupid posts in 
the forums where people just want to alter a link size but can't 
"because they don't know php". There may be some php knowledge IF you 
want but the myth needs killing. No-one says "Can't use MT cos it's Perl".

3. Forum overhaul ... the new users rule here. I have the knowledge of 
being around a while.

The numbers....

4. Everything spread over the place. Could be considered bad but wp.org 
still times out and if everything is there isn't that equivalent to 
putting all the eggs in one basket ?

5. Forum help. Dead right, and Craig and I have been saying this for a 
LONG time. newbie ? no problem. Middle-ish problem ? Okaaay if we've 
seen it before and remember. Deeper ? not a chance unless a coder 
wanders in. Those I have flagged up to this list have been looked after 
(Thanks !) but I could do that every day - and then that defeats the 
object as they would be ignored. the amount of help that Kaf, MdaWaffe 
(and others) have given is amazing.

Just an idea:

In the NetBSD Problem Report (PR) system, there is a number of people
who go through incoming PR's.  They then assign them to the "appropriate"
developers to look at.  For example, I maintain 45 software packages in
pkgsrc (the packaging system used by NetBSD, but also supporting Linux,
Solaris, Irix, HP-UX etc.).  Any PR's for those packages get assigned to
me.  That's part of the "contract" I've made by listing myself as the
maintainer of the packages.

Translated to WP terms, we could have people volunteer for specific areas
that they are familiar with, and get alerted about issues in those areas.

For example, by chance I've noticed a couple of threads about plugins I've
written, and I've responded.  But since I spend very little time on the
forums in general, I may have missed who knows how many others.  However,
I'd be more than happy to field questions and issues about my plugins, if
I was notified about them.

Regards,
+ Kim

As the project gets bigger and receives more contributors, I do think 
it's important to have a defined roadmap.  As with any planning, this 
begins by asking, "What are we trying to accomplish?"

I agree that the notion that PHP is required for WordPress is a myth, 
but we must also accede on the level at which a user's desire for 
customization excedes the capabilities of the default software.

Every comment I've seen made about how WordPress requires PHP is 
prefaced by some crazy notion of customization that no other system 
would be able to support without additional coding in its native 
programming language.  Should we even entertain these outlandish 
customizations as a failing of WordPress?  If so, then it's also a 
failing of any other blogging software that doesn't read a user's mind.

These resources should be distributed.  I don't mean just that there 
should be many individual islands of resources, but that the islands 
need to start sharing data.  Yes, I mean support/plugin/theme 
distribution by RSS/XMLRPC -- syndicated resources.  I could select the 
site with the presentation I like best, and obtain all of the same stuff 
that any of the other guys have.  When one goes down, all of the same 
resources are available on one of the "mirrors".

The reason why I don't bother with the forums:  I don't often need help 
because I know what I'm doing, and I don't want to sift through a ton of 
posts that other people have already answered.  It's also a waste of 
time to review posts that someone with non-developer knowledge could 
answer.  So create a flag that marks posts as "need dev help", and start 
marking posts.  Give me a page I can see them, and I'll stop by now and 
then.

For the record, every post that you (Podz) have posted to wp-hackers, I 
have looked at, and if someone else didn't answer first and I knew the 
answer, I replied.  This method *works*.

Would we consider a payment model for support on the forums?  Something 
like ExpertsExchange?  Users contribute a few cents into a pool.  Users 
who post answers that the original requester approves receive a share of 
the pot.  That way, support contributors are compensated for the 
successful work they perform.  (I expect that this suggestion will meet 
reluctance.)

I had a big long response typed up and then realized it boils down to 
the universal axiom: you can't please all of the people all of the time. 
To get up and running with a functioning blog in WordPress is typically 
a 2-step process that no one can beat. People that want to do advanced 
things with no knowledge of PHP may have a hard time. Some plugins are 
easy to use and others aren't. The support forums are incredibly helpful 
and supportive, but few people are willing to write someone's site for 
them with every little quirk that they want so sometimes people will be 
disappointed at the level of support.

That said, some thoughts:

1. For plugins, turn wp-plugins.org into more. I know there are plans 
for that. Perhaps have it be more moderated, such that plugins are peer 
reviewed to certain standards before listed, standards that would 
obviously need to be defined (e.g. plugin doesn't diminish the security 
of the install). Perhaps more code sharing and discussion in terms of 
plugin functionality so that less user-level PHP diddling is required in 
some cases (e.g. some plugins have elegant ways of using filters to 
insert/manipulate data such that actual function calls aren't added to 
templates) for more "one-step plugin installation" situations. That 
doesn't mean that only certain people are allowed to write plugins, but 
plugins that aren't "on the list" aren't supported on the forums and 
will be handled by the plugin author.

2. Further support forum functionality would be helpful, as mentioned by 
others. If nothing else, paging through the "Latest Discussions" would 
make it easier to browse the entire list.

3. There is no three. Currently.

    Brian

Subject: [wp-hackers] Rewriting search URL
Message-ID: <ade92a0e0504211328672b8a1d@mail.gmail.com>

One of the things I love wp for is it's permalinks systems that utilizes 
mod_rewrite. I have tried tens of blog scripts in the past but wp's is the 
best one. One thing I have noticed, however, it does not rewrite the search 
URL. So instead of something neat such as ' 
http://www.unicorns.com/search/unicorn', I see
'http://www.unicorns.com/index.php?s=unicorn&searchbutton=Go%21
' (using the Blix theme). If you ask me it looks completely out of place 
compared with the complex rewriting system used for every other possible 
link in the blog. So the question is, it it possible to rewrite the search 
URL? The rewrite itself is already implemented in .htaccess and the problem 
is how to redirect all search URLs to search/blah? Firas and me had a nice 
long conversation in #wordpress today and Firas wrote a small script that 
redirects search requests to search/blah. However, it only works on index 
and the solution itself isn't the best option. Any ideas people?

I'm a user, who wants to develop my own theme.  I do not know php.  I do
know basic HTML and I hope am intelligent enough to place tags in my theme
from the codex to make something pop up or not.  However, I'll be damned if
I can figure out how to make a horizontal menu going across the top under
the header image.  I could not find any plugins.  I wanted to make a menu
going across the top with the menu options the categories and pages in my
blog.  I gave up for now.

I remember back in 1.2 there was some site that had broken down the css file
as to what it did exactly.  Had it mapped out and everything.  I used it to
modify 1.2 css to create www.radialmonster.com

I can not find anything similar to this mapping for theme use in 1.5.  My
1.5 is at www.urbandestruction.com/blog.  There's nothing there really, just
testing.

With no docs easily found on how to use the 1.5 themes, the only thing I
could figure to do was load up the theme in 1.5 and firefox with the web
developer extension and modify the css and see what happened in real time.

Thanks

Phil Hart

The way I do it on my weblog [1] is to set the search form (i.e., the
form in wp-includes/sidebar.php) method to POST to
/archives/search-results, then redirect this with .htaccess to
/index.php. However I've written my own search code [2] so things are
actually a little more complex than that... however I think what I've
just mentioned should work straight off, as the query-string stuff in
wp-blog-header.php looks at both $_POST and $_GET.

This isn't a perfect solution either, as it means you can't bookmark
(or link to, etc.) searches as they don't have a specific URL. However
I'm not sold on the idea that bookmarking searches will ever be
possible unless you pass the search parameters through GET which makes
for polluted URLs, which I really don't like.

Anyway, some thoughts there.

I can add some perspective as well that I hope is helpful. I was a programmer but have not been f/t for many years, and am casualy proficient at PHP. That means I know what I need to do but lack the skills to get many things done fast enough to be worthwhile.

One the one hand I read frequent statements and commentary, especially around the WP sites, that WP is awesome in large part because of the large number of plugins. There are numerous referrals to plug-ins as solutions to issues.

Then when I dig deep into it I find many of the plug-ins step on each other, many are known not to be compatible with 1.5, and in my research I come across comments from those "in the know" to that effect. It can certainly make one feel duped. 

For examle I find a tech note on a WP site about making a static home page, via a plug-in. It looks authoritative, and it works. Only after really spending alot of time with WP do I realize that the example takes over the loop and if I want to do anything with it, I will have to completely understand all of the code and probably re-write it differently. As this commenter says, it all seems to suggest "learn to program and you'll be fine" but it seems to be promoted as "just use the plug-ins".

It also displays an air of primadonna-ness amongsth the developers, which is never good for acceptance.

Phil,

Horizontal navbars have nothing to do with PHP. Learn some CSS. Google for 
horizontal navigation bars in CSS and you'll find a lot.

There are tons of themes that use horizontal navbar, Blix being a more 
popular one.

Plugins are often born of an itch the plugin author needed to scratch.
WordPress makes it remarkably easy to make plugins that do all sorts of
things.  That, and the core WordPress development process' attention to
only those items that the overwhelming majority of users need, probably
encourages a lot more plugins than are necessarily helpful.

I know that the phpBB team has a rigid process for submitting mods. Each
submission must include a description file which must adhere to a strict
format.  The description file is parsed when you upload it.  If the file
doesn't parse properly, the submission is rejected outright.  Then, a
member of the team (or possibly several members) reviews the code, and
makes a determination as to whether the plugin is safe.  It's a slow
process, and plugins stay in the "pending" queue for a long time.

But, the upshot is that vetted plugins are pretty well guaranteed to
work for end users (as much so as is possible, assuming a default phpBB
installation on the user's end).

I spoke with DrDave about such a vetting process when he launched
wp-plugins.net, but it never went anywhere.  I realize it represents a
massive investment of time and energy for whoever would participate in
this kind of thing, but it might be one way to help filter known good
plugins up to the top for end users.  I'd be willing to help with this
process.

I remember back in 1.2 there was some site that had broken down the css file

as to what it did exactly.  Had it mapped out and everything.  I used it to
modify 1.2 css to create www.radialmonster.com

I can not find anything similar to this mapping for theme use in 1.5.  My
1.5 is at www.urbandestruction.com/blog.  There's nothing there really, just
testing.

With no docs easily found on how to use the 1.5 themes, the only thing I 
could figure to do was load up the theme in 1.5 and firefox with the web

Yes.  Thank you.  To customize Movable Type fully, you need to learn a) 
the Movable Type templating language with its loops, it's tags, its 
options, its if/else loops and b) Perl.  To customize WordPress fully, 
you learn some basic PHP.  Maybe it's just me, but PHP is a much more 
approachable language than Perl.

I've used Movable Type.  I wanted to do some fancy stuff that wasn't 
supported out of the box.  It was a major, major pain in the ass.  In 
fact, to be able to do fancy stuff in MT templates, I eventually started 
sticking the MT tag output into PHP variables and then using PHP to 
perform logic on them.  Heck, Brad Choate runs his entire site that 
way.  So now, you have to learn MT tags, Perl, and PHP.  And CSS is 
something you have to learn for any webdesign, no CMS can eliminate that.

Robert - Just to be clear, the first part of your answer made me cringe.  It's exactly what people don't want to hear: "Learn some CSS".  That's not to say it isn't (somewhat) true! ;)  Just that it's part of the 'stigma' of WP right now.

Another example/sample for the codex, or a plugin anyone? ;)

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/sem-theme/

you'll find a plugin which defines sem_header_nav() and sem_footer_nav()
template tags. They reflect your having a few predefined categories and pages.
You can hand edit the related arrays in the plugin's source if needs be.

That changes my url into the form of http://www.unicorns.com/?s=string, 
which is a progress. The aim, however is to change all search urls to 
http://www.unicorns.com/search/string

How about this?  Seems to work for me.

<?php

if ($_REQUEST['s'] && strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], '/search/') === 
FALSE ) {
$redirect_to = get_bloginfo('home') . '/search/' . $_REQUEST['s'];
wp_redirect($redirect_to);
exit();
}

?>

to your submit-button ... replace "searchform" with whatever name your

Keep on doing what we're doing. That's the first set of complaints I've seen 
and they're mostly valid, but we're not offering a panacea for blogging 
[yet]. That post is simply defining the set of people who can't handle 
WordPress in its present incarnation. With time and development, if we keep 
channels open for the average user to request features and we endure the 
flames that follow wise refusals, that set will diminish.

Perhaps, to handle the alleged lack of a templating system, someone would 
like to write a plugin. :-)

The question is: is Phil willing to learn it? Most users aren't. (I love 
learning it.) When we decide what to do to ease the learning curve for 
code-phobes, we must also leave the doors wide open for code-philes to go 
totally nuts with the guts of their themes. It should not become as 'easy' 
as Blogger at the cost of becoming as limited as Blogger.

For now, it would do wonders to help people understand that depth of 
customizability is lost in direct proportion to gains in ease of 
customizability. Translation: you can't make 3-D holograms with an 
Etch-A-Sketch.

This reminds me of the comment I left before about using modular 
themes.  If themes are the composition and layout of various modules, 
then it would be fairly easy to write a javascript layout manager that 
would let you drag modules from a palette into a template...

Thanks,

Allow me to restate:

In the absence of bloat, depth of customizability is lost in direct 
proportion to gains in ease of customizability.

When you put it that way, it sounds like we should have a dozen of them by 
now. The trouble with modular themes is that everyone wants them, everyone 
knows they can be done, but nobody has stepped forward with one. Seeing that 
it involves authoring not just a theme but a complete UI to manage the 
modules, plus massive documentation for the gamut of users, it's no wonder 
we don't have it yet.

But I trust we will at some point.

Here's a proof of concept for rewriting a query string into a url... 
works on apache. I'll leave integrating it in WP for you.

1. Create a test file 'testsearch.php' and put it in your WP root dir 
with the following:

<?php
// put search term back in form if exists
$str = (isset($_REQUEST['s'])) ? 'value="'.$_REQUEST['s'].'"': null;
// always submit form to your-WP-install/search/
$self = preg_replace ( '@/search.+@', '/search/', 
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] );
// note: form must be GET, POST won't work
?>
<form action="<?php echo $self; ?>" method="get">
<input type="text" name="s" <?php echo $str; ?> />
<input type="submit" value="search" />
</form>

2. Put these rules in your .htaccess above your WP rules, changing 
your-WP-install as needed:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /your-WP-install/
# get the query string, append to path and redirect.
# '?' in the rewriteRule removes query string from URL
# 'R' is an external redirect so new URL appears in location bar
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} s=(.+)
RewriteRule ^search/?$             search/%1/? [R]
# redirect to our search page, scraping URL for querystring if it exists
RewriteRule ^search/([^/]+)?/?$    testsearch.php?s=$1 [L]

Ok, follow up I guess.

Here's a thought - If I had to learn the ins and outs of php to create a
simple theme for my website, why not suggest me to start from scratch and
write everything, backend and all.

When Robert wrote: 
>  Horizontal navbars have nothing to do with PHP. Learn some CSS. Google
for horizontal navigation bars in CSS and you'll find a lot.  -  There are
tons of themes that use horizontal navbar, Blix being a more popular one.

I completely skipped over "learn css" and moved to "Blix does this already".
I HAVE looked up CSS horizontal menus.  I found several things on Eric Myers
web site, but I don't know how to translate that into wordpress.  I did
learn from his site, and several books I bought on css to do some things I
have on my site now.  I can handle looking at an existing theme that does
what I want, I can copy and paste code.  So, is wp designed only for people
who know css and php?  Or is Customizing it only for those who know it?

I guess my point being I shouldn't (in my opinion) need to be a master of
php and css to move the sidebar from the right hand side to the left.  (I've
already figured this out, no need to send suggestions, it's just an example,
but thanks!)

And I'm going to say something I will probably regret, so please don't take
offense anyone.  I'm kinda thinking out-loud here.  But, the lady who wrote
the original article that started this was last 40's.  I'm 27.  Young
whipper snappers like Matthew and Ryan who do this php stuff in their sleep
because they look at code all day don't have a problem creating themes.  But
the average joe blogger doesn't know php, nor css.  The don't care to buy 10
books from amazon on mastering php and css just to do move around items on
their blog.

Perhaps even this thought - the guys who create all the great php plugins
and look at the WP code all the time and help answer the support forums with
code questions could easily create a theme.  They know what the triggers are
to put something where and that sort of thing.  Know the limitations of what
that code would do, know the implications of parameters and the like.  But,
again, the average joe blogger does not look at the code for WP, maybe ever.
They don't care to know the code, either because they are scared to mess
something up, or simply don't understand it.  So, for everyone in the know,
it's easy to tell a theme newbie to learn css to modify their theme, but for
the user, it may be a hugely daunting task.

All this being said, I do not know how to make it any better.  I agree some
plugins seem so basically needed they should be included in code.  Or, have
an official recommended place on the wp site that lists known working and
compatible plugins to do different things.  One thing that comes to mind is
easy image uploading and posting to a thumbnail to a post.  What blogger
doesn't want to do that?  

I guess wp needs to decide if it's for blogging or cms like several have
already said.  What level of experience are you shooting for the end user to
have?  

I would of never said any of this unless this discussion was going on.  I
love my wp, and what it enables for my site.

I've taken to PHP and CSS pretty rapidly considering I'll be an old man in 
August when I turn 27 :-)

For your rhetorical questions, this answer makes sense to me:
No, anyone can use WP. There are so many custom themes CENTRALLY available, 
it might take you an hour to browse them all. If you want to get more custom 
than that, you will have to learn SOMETHING about CSS and/or PHP. You don't 
need to master them just to move your sidebar across the page.

IDEA: A one-click theme downloader that also browses screenshots from a 
server. Blogger has it, they just don't have as many themes to browse in one 
place. If it were in the core, the audience for WP would multiply so fast...

Just a bit of perspective.  Average joe bloggers use prepackaged themes
(usually the default).  Average joe wouldn't know what to do with a
drag-and-drop UI tweaker any more than he would know how to rearrange
tags.

That's not to say that we shouldn't endeavor to make templates as easy
as possible, but anyone looking at a template is not an average joe
user.  Anyone posting to the forums is not an average joe user.  Someone
who wants to make each category have a different look is not average
joe.  Average joe didn't even install WordPress himself.

27 years old.  I remember 27.  The youthful idealism hadn't worn
completely off yet.  Things seemed new and exciting when in fact they
were just the same old stuff in new togs.  Things like "tags" made your
eyes sparkle and your extremities tingle.  Ah, yes, 27.  Almost old
enough to know better, but not quite.  ;-)

What totally blows my mind is that someone who knows virtually nothing 
about performing the task would feel correct to complain that the task 
is too difficult for them to perform.  This is like me getting pissed 
because I botched that surgery I expected to go so well, relying only on 
my extensive experience applying Band-Aids.  Completely unrealisitc.

Nonetheless I do think improving the editability of templates is 
do-able.  (Obviously, since I attempted to craft some of this 
customizability in the RedAlt tool.)  Documentation could be brought to 
bear on "Creating Theme Templates From Scratch".  A library of code 
patterns for templates might be helpful.

Actually, I'm only 31, so my fogyism is a bit overplayed.  Still, there
seem to have been a lot more years than four between 27 and 31.

The more I read the discussion, the more I feel it's simply a 
"growth-pain" moment for WordPress. Matt, don't change anything, keep 
doing what we're doing.

It's all in the users expectation. Somehow, people now expect having a 
rich weblog with lots of features and a unique design on top of that to 
be easy. I think that, should we magically be able to make php and css 
ridiculously easy today, people will start complaining about the design 
and how *photoshop* is too difficult (1). Or how spelling and grammar 
are too hard.

I've been weblogging since before there was a name for it and I had to 
handcode each page in html (2).

A well designed site with rich content is hard work. It is slowly 
getting easier, and the fact that people are complaining about 
wordpress is a compliment: it means wordpress is being seen as the next 
logical step. Weblogging will get easier still, but it takes hard work 
by developers.

The "complaints" about plugins I have seen in the discussion are valid 
- perhaps we need  a system to 'validate' plugins to help that.

The "complaints" about the support forum are valid as well - perhaps we 
need a system that makes it easier to respond. If the main forum had an 
rss feed (as opposed to each individual thread) I might read it more, 
but that's just me.

The "complaints" about php and css being hard are valid, but sorry, 
there's nothing we can do about that right now. Either stick with the 
themes available, or wait for wordpress 3.0

But the overall picture that Matt and this group here is doing things 
"wrong" is not valid.

I have to disagree here.
The CSS - I asked when 1.3 was still young if we would have a fully 
commented guide to the CSS like Craig did for the original. I was told 
yes, not to worry, not to bother. It does not exist. It NEEDS to exist.

There is no basic guide for the new default template anywhere - it is 
needed.

The CSS / templates in the default need pulling to bits and redoing - 
have you looked at it in the editing window ? Mess City. Unfriendly. 
That is how Joe User will see them.

Put the links for help IN the css or in a commented piece somewhere that 
Joe User will actually see them. Stupidly easy for people to remove if 
they want.

Question: Do we actually WANT to make life easier for Joe User ? Some 
comments would hint that this is not the case. And if we do, then we ask 
JU what he wants, and we supply it. We don't run it past a board of 
enquiry, we don't compare it to what some guru says, we don't have 
conversations about the why / where / how - it's just done.

All you guys who can do php once wrote something along the lines of your 
first bit of code that went "Hello World". There are people wanting / 
trying / sweating to use WP who are not even there yet and if you want 
WP to be the complete success, you are going to have to help them. Codex 
isn't and cannot be that panacea.

Why no Help tab in WP ?

Forums: Another problem there is use of links. We ought to declare war 
on use of links. I'm as guilty as the next person for just dropping a 
link in, or saying Search, but increasingly it gives the wrong answer. 
Follow some links sometimes and they will lead to more links which then 
lead to dead threads. Asking people to search for some things does not 
give them the answer - and if I can't find it using Google and using the 
poster's names, then how in hell can Joe User ?

This is NOT growing pains - that post which Matt highlighted points at 
faults, faults which either need correcting OR ignoring, but until a 
decision is made as to what WP is trying to be, no-one will have a clue 
as to what to do and this fudge will recur.

A clear roadmap is essential, absolutely essential. The time has come 
for such a thing to be written. What /is/ WordPress ?

That's great.
I really think using smarty template would be great for wp.

I was wondering if we could adapt the sql code to have ir work
properly with many other DB (I was thinking about pgsql actually)
through adodb wrapper.
The main issue seems to be every database don't support auto increment
id like mysql so we would hae to do a select (MAX) on the id.
But maybe it's just a sweet dream

I think this idea would be somewhat overkill. I would say something much more
simple is enough, based on the positive feedback I get for my theme, e.g.:

> "I?m using your template... It?s by far... what i was looking for in the
wordpress system. Glad you made it, and also glad I found it at last."

I'm currently repackaging the theme as a set of tiles with built-in caching. In
their next version, they should be able to spit XML upon request, and eat an
XSLT file as an argument. And the theme should feature a few more tiles to put
in the sidebar.

I've a few other points regarding wordpress here:

I disagree, for many reasons stated many times elsewhere: Smarty is bloated,
it adds another level of complexity, and it is reinventing PHP.

Is it so much easier for non-programmers to use { wp_something } that <?php
wp_something ?> ?

Again, I'm starting to use AdoDB (and so far I like it), but WP already uses
ezSQL database class, which shares many same goals as AdoDB, only it is much
lighter (10KB vs 200+KB for trimmed-down Ado)

The problem with throwing the question of what WordPress needs to the 
masses is that we'll still end up removing chaff from the grain.  "It 
should include red-eye removal features for uploading images."  Getting 
a sense of what users really need without asking for noise seems like a 
better idea than fielding every crazy suggestion and then being 
denigrated for not including it.

I don't have an issue with attempting to improve WordPress' programmatic 
accessibility to Joe User.  Joe User needs to understand that even 
though he has made a suggestion, that doesn't mean it's a good idea or 
that anyone else would benefit by using their own time and effort to 
bring his ideas to life.

On the other hand, and here's where the forum and support is lacking, 
there isn't a well-defined place for Joe to lobby for his ideas where it 
gets visibility by developers.  Hell, I'm often looking for something 
dumb to code to waste an hour or so.  Set me up an RSS feed to these 
crazy user suggestions and watch the custom code fly.

Is it your expectation that WP becomes a tutoring ground for PHP newbies?

There is a lot of help in codex, some of it even assumes that the user 
doesn't really understand PHP.  Skippy's "The Loop" lesson is shaping up 
really well, actually.  Sure, it could use (a lot) more documentation 
like this, but there are so many other better online/offline resources 
for PHP that I don't think we should reinvent the wheel just to appease 
users who want something more complicated than can be accomplished by 
using the evolving Codex documentation to tweak existing template tags.

This is why I keep saying that there needs to be a line that once you 
cross it, you're in development territory.  You can certainly use 
WordPress with virtually no programming skill.  But as you start to 
demand custom features, you have to expect a little programming 
knowledge.  We can try to help out by documenting how to do simple 
things in Codex, but the plain fact is, you're going to have to pick up 
a PHP book if you don't know PHP and you want to write new code.  
WordPress can't write the code for you.

Sorry if this sounds more confrontational than it was intended, but I 
think it gets my points across clearly, so I won't soften it.  :)

I don't think WordPress ought to be an explicit tutoring ground for PHP
newbies, but I think it presents an _excellent_ opportunity to ease
newbies into familiarity with programming concepts in a way that they
can find immediately useful.  If they realize along the way that what
they're doing is PHP programming, great!  If not, no worries - their
templates end up looking the way they want.

WordPress using pure PHP rather than a templating language means we can
(and arguably should) gently introduce variables, constants, flow
control (if, else, while), etc.  This introduction is immediately
hands-on, and it's possible to make it easily digestible even for people
who do not want to be programmers.

The default WordPress template(s) probably ought to include newbie
friendly comments for as much as possible; as well as present a best
effort at a clean, unambiguous style (the bifurcation of CSS between
style.css and header.php, as mentioned elsewhere, makes it hard for
newbies to jump in).

If people are completely uninterested in learning PHP, they'll _at
least_ see comments like "If you delete this line, the sky will fall
down" or "You cannot simply copy this to a different place in your
template".

More in my line of fire was options or the lack of. Pinging could be 
switched on / off per post in 1.2 yet in 1.5 a decision was made to 
remove this. The "Options are bad" has already been voiced.
Where is it clear that if you want help you click a Title in the admin 
posting screen ? Hardly intuitive is it ?
The release of 1.5 has caused the number of CSS questions to rocket yet 
despite the knowledge gained from before, this was not used. 
Consequently, valid questions are being lost due to numerous questions 
about the default template. A proper guide for that is essential.

Yes - there is - it's the forums. Just go look but again you will have 
to look correctly. The problem is EXACTLY what the post matt referred to 
said. Now whether the software is at fault can be discussed but from 
what's been said, should I be flagging one thread for the hackers list, 
another for the devs list, another for another list ? No.

I appreciate that but who does the work to supply the feed ?

No.

So lets be a little more truthful on wp.org ?
Not wrap it up so nicely, be a touch harsher, lower expectations ?

How widely available is Smarty? Would basing WP's templates on it
exclude users on cheaper hosts?

Smarty is not an appropriate solution.  You'll be replacing WordPress's 
PHP template layout system with an equivalently complex templating 
solution that is ultimately less powerful, and equally confusing.  
Smarty does not add any additional abstraction that hasn't been already 
accomplished with PHP and a proprietary WordPress API.

Thanks,

I'm currently working on a plug-in that, when configured with your A/S/L

Of course we do. I don't think anyone could compare WP .71 to 1.5 and 
say that hasn't been something we've been doing our very best at. Sure 
there will be mistakes along the way, but the end goal has never changed.

What IS the 'end goal'?  Is there a roadmap for where WP is going in the 
future, how to make the product/experience better for Joe User?

http://wordpress.org/

"WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing platform 
with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability."

I think we have a lot we could improve in at least two of those three 
categories.

"More simply, WordPress is what you use when you want to work with your 
blogging software, not fight it."

People are still fighting, we need to make it as easy as technically 
possible.

http://wordpress.org/about/

"We hope by focusing on user experience and web standards we can create 
a tool different from anything else out there."

Again, the focus on the user experience. We all love software that is a 
joy to use and elegant to work with. As far as WordPress can become that 
software to more people, I think we're doing a good job.

It's tough work -- it hasn't been easy and it won't get any easier. 
There are proprietary and commercial companies trying to do the same 
thing, except with millions of dollars and dozens of full-time 
employees. However they don't have the community or passion that we 
have, and I think we can do a better job and make the world a better 
place in the process. I truly believe this, otherwise I would have given 
up or sold out long ago.

Great Matt! 
I too think that usability in all its guises is key to making
WordPress the blogging/CMS application for the masses.
I think the usability report from Gabriel White is probably a good
starting point. Not that we should implement everything slavishly, but
there are some very good points which I think are worth considering.

I know there is a list of new features/major changes for 1.6 on the
codex but I think that post 1.5.1 we need a detailed road map.

Much more than a bullet list, though its a good starting point.
Something with specific details fleshed out. Not implementation/coding
details, but how things will work, what things there will be to click,
what will happen when they are clicked. Use cases, however informal,
practical, functional design.

I know I always harp on about it, but we still need the design
decisions to be documented somewhere other than in real time on IRC!

Mike

Good point, and reminding me that I haven't been on IRC much lately. Why 
don't we have weekly IRC meetups just to powwow and brainstorm and get 
community feedback?

I would suggest 2 PM PST on Wednesdays, that's 4/5 PM on the east coast 
and 9/10 PM over in England. (Daylight savings is confusing me.)

Are there feeds for the individual sections (e.g. Installation, How-To and 
Troubleshooting, etc...)?

Matt, that would be fantastic.  The session should be logged and posted 
somewhere as well.  I've seen a lot of great brainstorming on #wordpress 
end up going nowhere, but if we had a set time where there could be a 
roundtable session, these ideas could get wide exposure to the devs and 
you guys would be able to give feedback right away.  Very excited.

Totally, we can post the logs from that hour or so to this list so 
everyone can catch up.

  <form action="/" method="get">

<input value="<?php echo wp_specialchars($s, 1); ?>" name="s" id="s" />
<input type="submit" value=" !" id="searchbutton" />

Some more:

0001239: Allow a 'redirect_to' parameter on logout.  io_error wrote some 
great code to show the login/logout form on the front page of the blog.  
With this patch, when using his code, you won't be thrown to the default 
login page after every logout, but instead go back to the page you were on.
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1239

0001240: Allow 'redirect_to' parameter on login for level 0 users.  
Currently, it /always/ goes to their profile page, ignoring the 
redirect_to parameter.  This is also handy for io_error's nice frontpage 
login/logout code
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1240

0001148: Perhaps consider moving the paged comment editing plugin by 
Coldforged into core.  Currently you are restricted to viewing 20 
comments at a time.  His plugin allows you to view them paged, as well 
as look at the spam comments if you want.  Very cool.
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1148

Those, and the ones you mentioned, and I think we're really, really close.

They are both WordPress functions.  wp_redirect() is 1.5.1, I think, so 
you'll need to upgrade to a recent nightly.

Just IMHO, those sound nice, but all look like 'features' and not bugs. 
Personally, I want 1.5.1 asap, as there's been a LOT of bugfixes that need 
to get out to users in a 'supported release'.  Certainly 1148 shouldn't hold 
up this release, as it is already available and working in a plugin -- add 
such functions to the core in a future 'feature release'.

Again, just IMHO -- would like to see 1.5.1 finish up with necessary 
bugfixes, and move onto a new version for continued feature enhancements, 
usability work, user experience work.  1.5.1 is a moving target otherwise. 
;)

Sorry to crash the coding party here, but could I just point out that 
this is rather a bad idea?

Because an URL like this doesn't have any "?"s in it, Google (and other 
search engines) won't know it's a page of search results, so whenever 
someone happens to link to it, search engines will index it *in addition 
to* the actual article pages. The end result will be that search engines 
are cluttered with result pages from your own search engine (indeed, 
I've seen sites trying to game Google using this technique). Worse, the 
results will often be irrelevant because they'll be plucking keywords 
from the summaries of several distinct Weblog entries.

If you want cruft-free search result URLs, I suggest aiming for 
something like <http://example.com/search?cat+pictures>. Same number of 
characters, but the ? tells indexers (and geeky humans, who should not 
be neglected) that the page quite probably isn't static writing.

Your form needs to have an attribute "name" with the name of the form 
(e.g. "searchform"). Then the onclick-thing should be placed into the 
submitbutton tag.

 <form action="/" method="get" name="searchform">
  <fieldset>
   <input value="<?php echo wp_specialchars($s, 1); ?>" name="s" id="s" />
   <input type="submit" value="   !" id="searchbutton" 
onClick="document.searchform.method='post'; 
document.searchform.action='/search/' + document.searchform.s.value ;" />
  </fieldset>
 </form>

If the user has no javascript the form behaves like before. If he/she 
has it the method gets changed to "post" which can be a bad thing when 
the user tries to reload the search results ... but it works (see 
www.sebbi.de) ...

Good point, but I have linked a search result in one of my blog posts 
and I am having visitors from Google for exactly that search. If there 
is a link to a search, google (and others) are likely to include it in 
their index (unless you add some special meta tags or robots.txt). If 
there are is no link, how should google ever know what to index? It's 
not like the googlebot sits in front of my searchform and tries 
different phrases ;-)

Guilty as charged!  But to be fair, I submitted patches for the first 
two, so they're "low-lying fruit"

This is a gross use of links. Use static addresses (or pseudo-static) whenever
possible. Search engines will index dynamic search results pages, but the gain
in terms of ranking (e.g. PageRank) is low or non-existent. This was a
-discussed topic in alt.internet.search-engines.

Plugins can hook into the wp_logout action to redirect somewhere other
than the login page.  For example:

add_action('wp_logout', 'example_logout');
function example_logout() {
  header('Location: ' . get_settings('siteurl'));
  exit();
}

I already have an enhanced version of the paged comments and paged posts
functionality working as a core code submissions and am getting
something for paging pages together, but I wasn't necessarily targeting
the 1.5.1 bug fix release due to when I started the work. I would rather
it be in a follow-on so it could get some good exercise in nightlies
before hitting the public, as it _is_ a substantial change. I plan to
post here with a login to my sandbox to get some feedback on a live
install of it before submission as well.

They don't really cost that much more than any other dynamic page in 
WordPress, if at all. I could see permanent search URIs being useful as 
aggregators across different categories for a topic. I like how 
www.a9.com does it as well. (I use them as my primary search engine now.)

Also I've talked before about how a search result page could be like a 
wiki, anyone could edit it and tailor things to their liking, basically 
allowing you to create some exciting community-driven results for 
popular phrases. (This was the original idea behind the bbPress search.)

Great, then we're back to themes that require plugins. You certainly
can't hook into the wp_logout action from a theme. I tried it. :)

1239 and 1240 are by no means showstoppers. We'll all live if they
aren't "fixed" in 1.5.1. Neither should they be dismissed so casually.
A plugin isn't the right way to "fix" 1239. I marked it "feature"
because it is indeed a feature request.

1240 is a little different. It's some unexpected and surprising
behavior, and someone should look at it.

Can we get RSS of a search result?  That would be slick.

Sure, but I wasn't talking about how much they cost WordPress. I was 
talking about how they generate irrelevant search results in external 
search engines. You might get more hits (and who'd say no to extra 
traffic, right?:-), but most of the extra people won't be getting 
anything like what they wanted.

Which the "?" equivalent could do just as well.

<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW, NOARCHIVE">

Well, that's one way of fixing it.

That wouldn't alter the problem, unless you're suggesting that the 
majority of search results will contain original user-contributed text 
that's not in any of the results themselves.

Heh.  Good in theory, except that the wp_logout hook is /*completely and 
utterly useless*/ because there is no way for a plugin to use it.  You 
can put that code in a plugin, but it will not be run on logout, because 
plugins aren't loaded when you do /wp-login.php?action=logout      Doh!

Anyway, both 1239 and 1249 have a patch (actually, one patch for both), 
so the time (about 10 minutes) has already been spent.  1240 is a bug.  
1239 wouldn't be a problem if the wp_logout action worked, but it 
doesn't, and it makes the logout action consistent with the login action.

The wp_logout action works from plugins in 1.5 (just checked).

To be sure, wp-login.php includes wp-config.php, which includes
wp-settings.php, which loads plugins.  If it's not working, make sure
you're calling exit().  Otherwise your redirect is overridden by the
code following the wp_logout action.

I wasn't doubting the reasoning for the issues, just throwing an idea
out there for consideration.  There are plenty of situations where the
wp_logout action isn't appropriate, and 1239 is one of them.  My
apologies.

And how would that happen? Google (and others) doesn't try different 
searches, they only follow links. And if someone finds a search result 
on your blog interesting enough to link it, why shouldn't this be in the 
Google index?

Next time you announce a plugin please consider assigning the plugin a 
"tag" that's the same as your plugin's sanitized name in the repository. 
This would make it really easy to watch discussion about your plugin 
across the blogosphere and also for people to tag threads in the support 
forums that you should keep an eye on.

For example, here's the "coffee2code" tag on the forums:

http://wordpress.org/support/tags/coffee2code

Also, if you have a few minutes please consider tagging some topics in 
the forums, it's a great way to contribute to WP 5 minutes at a time.

Would it be possible to put up a quick heatmap of popular tags at 
http://wordpress.org/support/tags/ instead of the "not found" message 
that currently sits there?  It would facilitate finding tags...

Soon! The plan is to replace the current forum list with a heat map, as 
soon as we have enough data in there. Why should people work in the 
"forums" we created two years ago rather than creating their own on the fly?

I was playing with Latent Semantic Indexing this morning, more or less 
because I was bored, and I discovered that it gives some interesting 
search results.  My personal biggest gripe with WP is the searches 
really suck.  On the other hand, doing LSI is impossible because it

This can be interesting too, when I'm finished with it.

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/search-reloaded/

It's not based on LSI; rather, it is based on my own research in search
engines. At the moment, it merely identifies a seed of potentially
interesting posts, and sorts them using a rather simplistic criteria.

The next version will use the seed to find and return clustered results -- I
forecast a huge improvement in relevance when compared to the first version.
What more, the upcoming version of the clustering plugin will mutate the
clusters based by interacting with users. I might also add a plugin hook to
add a search criteria analysis step (e.g. to automatically correct common
spelling mistakes).

I've found quite a number of available rss aggregators for WordPress. In no
particular order:

http://www.feedhacks.com/blog/?p=4
http://www.auburnmedia.com/wordpress/?p=892
http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/

http://blog.carthik.net/vault/2004/04/09/fof-powered-subscriptions-page-hack
/
http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/

I'd need one that creates posts out of feeds. I understand several of the
above can do this. 
I'm curious to know if any of you have experienced difficulties using them.

Subject: [wp-hackers] JSP in WordPress?
Message-ID: <426FBDD3.3000006@cygnusinteractive.com>


I'm trying to integrate WordPress into a site that is written in JSP. We 
want to have WordPress/PHP use the same include files as the JSP pages, 
which will work fine for the static JSP files with plain HTML and no 
code, but for the JSP files used as includes that actually have JSP code 
that needs to be executed, is there a solution?

I guess what we need is a way for PHP to include JSP pages, and execute 
the JSP within them when doing the include. Possible?

thanks...

I've used the one from LaughingMeme to power my War on Spam site for 
some time now (http://spam.gunters.org/). I just made a few 
modifications to suit my needs, and it works fine.

It would also be great if the Magpie updated provided with FeedWordPress
was integrated into the standard WordPress distribution.  The additional
charset support is "a must" and I use it for other projects.

I should add that the FeedWordPress version of Magpie has preserved the
mods made to Magpie when it was included with WordPress, so it is not
attempting to undo any of those changes.

The only possible issue I saw was that it introduced one or two new
functions in the global namespace (unless I misread it).  However, since
it is being used with WordPress as is, at least it shouldn't break
anything.

If you're using Apache with mod_jk2 as a connector to your Servlet 
container (Tomcat?), you should look into the Apache specific virtual():

http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.virtual.php

This should pass a subrequest through the Apache request chain, and I 
assume you're mapping to your JSP connector via file extension or 
something.  I suspect you'll run into trouble, but this is a good place 
to start.  Use virtual() in header.php and see what happens.

Or, it might be completely irrelevant because you didn't tell us 
anything about your setup.

Actually, the feedwordpress version of magpie is totally messing everything 
up. One one hand, it detects the feed's encoding fine but on the other - it 
doesn't display it right (using a Russian windows-1251 charset). The default 
magpie does not detect the charset but displays Russian characters just 
fine. I have reported this bug to the hack outhor but he was yet unable to 
find a solution.

It works fine for ISO-8859-1 -> UTF-8 for me...

Do you have a sample feed for reproducing the issue?  I'd like to take
a quick look.

To: helpout@wordpress.org

Hi,

I installed wordpress 1.5 and it kept complaining that php had no mysql
support.
Fortunately I could solve the problem by adding a few lines of code. I
thought lets contribute this back.

Currently wp-settings.php includes the following lines:

if ( !extension_loaded('mysql') )
         die( 'Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL
which is required for WordPress.' );

I recommend something like the following which will load the module if
its not loaded but available:

if (!extension_loaded('mysql'))
{
         if (!dl('mysql.so')) {
                 exit;
         }
}

It solved the problem for me (I am running Ubuntu Linux Hoary with
apache 2.0.53).

I like wordpress! keep up the good work!

Regards,

Herman Bos

ps. I hope I contacted the right e-mail adres. I couldn't find any bug
reporting stuff on the site.

Looks like a good patch to include to me, minus the exit and plus die('Could 
not load the mysql extension for mysql')

It also says we could use some better linking to mosquito.

Hi, I'm a newbie to this list, but since patches seem to be on people's 
brain's here are these two modifications I made to get ssl working 
properly:

in wp-admin/install.php

#$guessurl = str_replace('/wp-admin/install.php?step=2', '', 'http://' 
. $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] .dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) );
$scheme = "http";
if ($_SERVER['HTTPS'] == "on")
{
     $scheme = $scheme."s";
}
$guessurl = str_replace('/wp-admin/install.php?step=2', '', 
$scheme.'://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) );


and in wp-admin/upgrade-schema.php

#$guessurl = preg_replace('|/wp-admin/.*|i', '', 'http://' . 
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
         $scheme = "http";
         if ($_SERVER['HTTPS'] == "on")
         {
             $scheme = $scheme."s";
         }
         $guessurl = preg_replace('|/wp-admin/.*|i', '', 
$scheme.'://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);

Hope these are useful.

PS. List moderator, my apologies, I'm such a newbie I initially posted

Most of you have seen the Blogs Of The Day announcements on the plugin 
competition blog. For the rest, BOTD is a site I've been building to 
maintain a list of WordPress sites (more generators later) indexed by 
popularity (more indices later). The client end of the system is a very 
simple plugin that adds an invisible image to the footer of every post, Page 
and WP homepage. This is something I'd eventually like to see bundled in WP,

I now have the plumbing roughed out and working with some efficiency (thanks

Freewordpress is quite awesome. And the built-in plugin hooks are exactly
what I was looking for. Thanks for saving me a great amount of time with
your recommendation.

> Actually, the feedwordpress version of magpie is totally messing
everything up. One one hand, it detects the feed's encoding fine but on the

The default magpie does not detect the charset but displays Russian
characters just fine.

I get the opposite: The default version of magpie displays characters in an
erronous way. Whereas the included version corrects this.

The default only allows you to choose one category, I needed to choose
two. The plugin, which I should have found myself(!) allows one to use
URLs of the form:
http://site.com/feed/atom/?cat=17,4,5&intersection=1

to get a feed of all items that are in ALL THREE categories...

Oh, beautiful! I emptied the tables less than 24 hours ago and it's already 
at over 14,000 hits. And now that PhotoMatt and WordPress have taken over 
the top ten by hits, I'm forced to work out the categorization scheme.

I was going to use the RDF that WP generates by default but it's 
conveniently missing from some sites, e.g. PhotoMatt. Maybe later the plugin 
will generate a little RDF data for its own indexing purposes: author, date, 
title, site name and URL, categories, MPAA rating...

Matt, you're pure evil for hacking it to run on every page wordpress.org 
generates. Especially the forums and the search results. Really, really 
evil. I deactivated the Generator filter, which would have blocked all 
wordpress.org pages because they lack the meta tag. Thanks for all the 
traffic, though; it's just what I needed. Any time you want to knock it back 
to handling just the blog and pages, go right ahead. Until then, I'll just 
populate this here referrer blacklist and... :-)

Does anyone know of any service that utilizes vote-for/vote-against tags 
yet?

Thanks to all other testers, too. Email me if you have suggestions or 
concerns unless you think it would be of interest to the list. Check 
www.blogsoftheday.com periodically for updates to the plugin source and see 
where your site ranks!

Top ten 0wn3d! ;) I'll take it off WP now. Don't rely on the RDF, I 
don't even think that's in the new default templates.

Really? Huh. I get stats with display:none. Maybe it's browser-dependent. 
Maybe you were seeing the five minute delay before hits appear in the 
database. Anyway, I'll take it out of the next version and meanwhile 
encourage everyone to delete this line from their plugin:
$botdImgTag.= 'style="display: ' . $display . ';" ';
This will make the image visible on your page. If you really don't want it 
there, change the height and width to zero (0). If you really like it a lot, 
change it to 800x150. What the heck, right?

It would have been cool that to make it clear on your plugin's page what
license your are using to distribute your work. Please answer ASAP if GPL
applies. ;)

To wp-hackers:

I've reworked Jonas' yahoo2tag plugin to make it more suitable for plugin

for instance.

The documentation is available at:

Yeah, I'm going to need more servers before I know it and I don't know how 
I'll fund them. Sound familiar? I asked Matt if I was crazy and he said he 
didn't think so but he wasn't very convincing. Just do me a favor and DON'T

Loads. I just have to work out how to get the data into BOTD. I'll probably 
end up adding Dublin Core-based meta tags to the head section just like 
dougal.gunters.org already does. That makes parsing super easy.

Matt, are you using a hacked BOTD plugin? I'm still getting hits for 
specific ranges on your random number generator and I don't think 
the_permalink($id) should be replicating a user-entered query. 'Fess up! Oh, 
and I'm running into 404's when I try to reindex your site's titles. Is that 
Bad Behavior?

I've three projects that could use some beta testing:

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/extract-terms/
http://www.semiologic.com/res/sem-extract-terms.zip
Extracts yahoo terms from a post, returns an array for use in other plugins

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/terms2search/
http://www.semiologic.com/res/sem-terms2search.zip
Extracts yahoo terms from a post, returns search queries on your site to
find related posts

http://www.semiologic.com/projects/terms2tags/
http://www.semiologic.com/res/sem-terms2tags.zip
Extracts yahoo terms from a post, returns technorati tags for your post
(like Jonas' Yahoo2tags, but more relevant)

The first plugin is a prerequisit for the two others and can be used for a
variety of other purposes.

You'll notice I haven't put the download links yet on the plugin pages. I'm
not sure the extract terms plugin handles non-utf8 charsets properly. Thus,
I'd be very interested if a cyrillic language user tested this if any
happens to be reading this list.

Any other kind of beta tester is of course welcome to play with the plugins
as well.

Jonas has no dibs on anything he writes. If no &copy; is stated, we

Andy - I just added a customized version to CHAITGEAR, so you should be 
seeing hits.  Looks like it's working.  When I upgrade to 1.5, I'll be able 
to use the raw plugin, but I had to add some hackery for my CG codebase. ;)

I'm just removing the display: line, to see if that makes a difference. 
Also, I'm urlencoding the botdURL -- lemme know how that comes through.

You should see a good 1000 or so a day coming from me.

Also, talking about scalability, you may want to go to a single-pixel image 
(the http headers become the bandwidth), and may want to try something 
faster than apache (lighttpd or one of those).

Glad to see someone starting a raw WP counter!

The plugin led to absolute b0rkage for me.  I use a second Loop to pull 
out a single category into my sidebar.  The post that the plugin detects 
for is_single() never is.

I think this is probably an issue only on my blog, and I should revise 
my sidebar a bit to compensate for it, but I thought I would mention it 
in case anyone else noticed this on their blog and didn't know what was 
going on.

Also, I'm not crazy about just stuffing the image into the footer.  I 
removed the add_action() call and just call the output function directly 
from the sidebar.  I don't know if others had switched to this method or 
not, but I suspect if it's done more often than not, you might consider 
packing the plugin that way to begin with.

Sorry.  I'm rambling after having gorged myself on a couple of cups of 
these delicious "dark side" M&Ms.  Mmmm...

Yeah I had the same problem, I just ended up putting 
_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] on the end. I'm taking it down from my site shortly.

This reminds me that WP really needs a kickass (and fast/efficient) 
stats plugin, especially one that covers RSS like feedburner does.

(Oh, please no.  This is the kind of thing that gets me running off to 
finish those unfinished projects all at once.)  I'll throw BAStats into 
the wp-plugins repo if someone else will commit to taking it over.

wp-stattraq isn't half bad.

No worries, O. The whole point of the function/add_action combo was to allow 
you to use it as a template tag wherever you like. It's not documented yet, 
but that's the intention. I don't use a sidebar on all of my pages, but the 
footer is always there so it seemed a decent catch-all.

That explains the query hits I got from photomatt.net. I believe I could 
make this work with RSS: in the simplest implementation your server will be 
the one pinging BOTD, which makes stat gaming easier and is the reason I 
went with the hosted image paradigm. What else would you like to see it do 
and why else are you dropping it from photomatt.org?

PhotoMatt.org is some other guy. All .NET here. ;)

It was good for a few hours but I'm just not entirely comfortable with 
my stats being public.
