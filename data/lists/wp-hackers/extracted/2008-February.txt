Yes, and I wanted to make an example using a table and sorting by

I think "whooami" did a decent job in responding so far.

It seems to me that if there's anywhere that "we" (WP dev/hacker community)
dropped the ball, it's the period of time between 12/12/2007 (when trac
ticket #5313 was closed) and 2/2/2008 (when it was reopened after an exploit
had been published).

Judging by the timeline illustrated by that ticket's history, in combination
with the ongoing discussion in the linked support forum thread insisting
that the threat was real, there is a nearly two month period of time in
which potentially no one was looking at this very closely. I could be wrong
on that, and maybe people were working hard behind the scenes and just not
finding anything, but it seems to me (after looking at the exploit) that one
of us should have been able to definitively confirm or deny that issue
within the last four months.

It's easy for me to say that, since I obviously didn't take the time to look
into it either, but I think maybe we should at least acknowledge this
situation as a mistake and resolve to learn from it.

As to the age old debate on whether full disclosure is appropriate or not,
the trac ticket history in this case again gives evidence to its "effective
motivating value" (for lack of a better term): closed on 12/12 for lack of
POC, reopened and quickly fixed on 2/2 when the POC code was released. Of
course, he could have / should have sent the POC exploit in privately, but
it's just surprising to me that none of us was able to reproduce it without
the exploit in these last four months.

Well thanks Jared, since I'm whoami :P

Fwiw, the discoverer of the problem and the POC (atleast not the one thats
on my site and is functional [it's actually an exploit]) didnt come from the
same source. Not that that matters, but I wanted to make that clear. I wont
express my frustration here since I think it's clear within the actual
thread how I feel....

Jared, instead of speaking generally, could you share what evidence
was overlooked?

I wasn't saying we overlooked any evidence, just that we didn't follow up on
it as well as we could have.

The evidence was basically just the reports of people's posts being
compromised in this manner. Since they were pretty serious, I think we could
have done more to either confirm or deny that there was a vulnerability that
caused this to be possible. I didn't say anyone overlooked this; I was only
suggesting that perhaps the issue shouldn't have been dropped as soon as it
was when a cause could not originally be identified.

BTW, I'm intentionally using language like "we", etc. because I'm not
intending to bash anyone or start flame wars. My simple point was that if
more of "us" in the WP dev community looked more closely at this issue I
believe that the root cause would have been discovered. Of course, that's
easy to say in hindsight, but since there are a limited number of places in
the code where a post can be modified like this (outside of SQL injection,
etc.) we theoretically could have found this one if we had enough people
seriously looking for it, IMHO.

Also, I think I was clear in lumping myself into the group of people who
didn't put enough effort into working on this problem. I have no good
excuses (other than the standard "not enough time"), but like I said,
perhaps we can just learn from this and do better next time. Perhaps more of
us can dedicate our time to this type of stuff instead of more "user facing"
/ recognizable stuff like adding more features.

The perception that WordPress has a poor security record is an issue
close to my heart.

I'm not not certian what should have been followed up on? whooami and
otto42 and others were proactive and tried to get additional
information and pursue the issue. Maybe, could you provide an timeline
with people's actions describing how the issue could have been pursued
more proactively?

My feeling is there probably isn't many specific insights in this
scenario, but you are correct there is great opportunity to contribute
to WordPress' security profile.

I imagine more interesting is analysing characteristics of individual
and classes of WordPress security problems to see if there are more
lurking, opportunity for programmatic protection, or training.

Unfortunately, for me, I have little programming juice, and none in security.

Aside, I find http://blogsecurity.net/ awkward participation, because
I don't think I've ever seen a reference to a trac ticket number in
any of the posts, or updates when issues are resolved.

That is no more or less true than any other exploit discovered or yet
to be discovered. There is only a short list of goals of compromising
a system.

I don't think there is any excess of people working on "user facing"
stuff either unfortunately.

Are there specific things that you are now working on related to this now?

Well, Im pissed. Why?

this, posted to the forum thread by Matt, and followed by my being banned
from the forums
"whoami, your fix does not. I would rather not have people think they're
safe and really not be, and there is a release coming shortly anyway. If
you'd like to post more to this thread please reply to the email I sent you
this morning. If  anyone is scared and wants a fix NOW, they should either
turn off registration (which is off by default) or delete xmlrpc.php.

1. the fix isnt mine. It's securiteam's.
2. Its tested, and yes, it does work, for the exploit provided.
3. I never got an e-mail you from this morning and I'll stop short of
calling you out on that fact except to say that I was at my computer most of
the day, and would NOT have missed an e-mail from you had I received it.

I think your apparent anger is a little misdirected Matt , especially given
all the dates that have been tossed about regarding this.

whoo

Yes but we think there's a different issue it doesn't address and it's 
generally bad policy to have people mucking around editing a huge PHP 
file. They should do one of the fixes above, both non-harmful, or wait 
for the release.

Thanks, Andy, for a great entry-point I can use to say hello.

I won't go into why I've been so slow/reluctant to get into things WP ... maybe

Say what?
It should be a matter of toggling a bit somewhere.

The editor window opens. It displays WYSIWYGAISS. (What You See Is What You Get

That click toggles how much logic?

Thanks. It's usable. But I have to wonder why it was so hair-pulling.
Have we here confounded "tabs" with "WYSIWYG/AISS"?

I take that as a fault indication.
We're talking about a presentation that has one of 2 states.
One of those 2 is default.
The other is selected by a single click.
We would benefit by having that 2nd state become default.

Oh, wait ... are you talking about the tabs that would allow that selection?

I didn't mention anything about that, outside of the context of this
particular issue. I didn't mean to imply that anyone on this list (including
you) don't care about security problems (only encouraging that we could all
do better); sorry if it came across that way.

I'm really not interested in making this an argument at all, so I'd rather
not do a full on reconstruction of the events here. You may disagree with my
view on this, and I certainly respect your opinion.

To keep it as short as possible: the original report may have been lacking
technical details (which is understandable for most users). Lots of people
responded, asking good questions to try to get to the heart of the matter.
Lots more people chimed in stating that they had been hit as well.

"rawalex" posted one month ago pointing directly to xml-rpc as the cause of
the problem. Between that point and now is primarily where I feel that we
could have found this, if enough people were concerned.

I believe that the fact that we didn't until an exploit was finally
published (even though it has apparently been in "private" use for months)
may send a message to some that disclosure is what it takes to get moving on
this type of issue.

I couldn't agree more. This is what I was alluding to earlier in my closing
remark about new features usually taking a much more prominent focus.

This is where I disagree. I think we had enough info in this case (see my
comment above about rawlex's post from a month ago) to make this different
than just a random 0-day security breach that we couldn't be expected to
prepare for.

Perhaps, but even as a topic of conversation (on this list) it doesn't seem
to come up much, outside of the context of addressing a specific known
vulnerability. I suppose it's like that with most open source projects,
though, and I certainly don't have an answer for how to change that.


>
> Are there specific things that you are now working on related to this now?


As time permits, but unfortunately it usually doesn't. Perhaps in the eyes
of some, that disqualifies my statements here, and I recognize that. That's
why I was sure to include myself in the list of people who could have done
more on this issue and didn't.

But since you asked, the last thing I did regarding security was submitting
a patch to WPMU ticket #528, which ported over Ryan's password salting and
cookie authentication fixes from the standard WP trunk. It didn't get
commited, and the ticket was closed with an indication that it would wait
until the 2.5 sync. I'll also note that I didn't come back and whine about
it (here or elsewhere) or get into a close/reopen battle on Trac.

I do really believe that those security related changes were important
(arguably moreso with MU since there are likely to be more registered users
per install), but if the commiters and/or enough users disagree, I'm not
going to spend any time arguing about it. I barely had the free time to
write it, and definitely don't have the excess time to debate and campaign
for it.

Lastly, I got the feeling that you (perhaps on behalf of the project as a
whole) were feeling attacked or criticized. Let me clarify again that that
was not the intent of my comments. My only hope is to motivate others here
in the community to do more than we have been regarding security, especially
in cases where there are multiple reports of active exploits with strong
hints as to the source of the problem.

I feel I should chime in as the original owner of that trac ticket. I
hope this is evidence that I was taking the issue seriously and wanted
to work to fix it.

At the time the ticket was closed there was no evidence that what was
being seen was anything anything more than people noticing a past
exploitation through a known, fixed, issue. No one could provide even a
rough guess as to when their site was exploited, only when they had
noticed it. There was no evidence as to the vector the exploit used.

No one doubted that users were experiencing problems, one of my own
installations had been exploited. My logs didn't go back far enough to
pin point when so I couldn't confirm an issue with the current release.
I extended my logging across all my installations with the hope of
catching it again. I've been monitoring my logs over the past month.

I didn't see anything wrong with closing the ticket as until actual
evidence was found, there was little to do beyond stare at the code and
hope for enlightenment.

James

Jared, I disagree that there is evidence that anyone "dropped the
ball", and assuming that was the case, I don't see solutions being
presented.

"rawalex" did provide some great clues, and I hope that he sent that
information and all the details he had to security@wordpress.org.

If we look at the log of xmlrpc.php, we will see a number of security
improvements around the time:
http://trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/xmlrpc.php . Clearly an exploit
wasn't identified, or there would have been a release, but
opportunities to harden the code were found.

http://trac.mu.wordpress.org/ticket/528 is an awesome example of
participating Jared! And I know first hand how hard it is to find the
time, and how frustrating it is when the same priority I give to an
issue isn't shared by others. The original ticket by "drmike" isn't a
good one. No ones mother knows "how easy it is to lift a password hash
in wordpress", because the first requirement is getting access to or a
copy of the database, which if happens your mother is already really
upset with you. It is still a very important issue, and the
collaboration that has taken place around resolving the issue is
brilliant!

I long ago learned that if you don't have the time to champion an
issue, there is no point in reporting it, and even less in providing a
patch. The exception is the bug whose stink has be smelt in the next
room. You seem to be suggesting that donncha disagreed with the
importance of this issue, but I don't think he wrote that or thinks
that. He wrote "it's such an invasive change to the users table it's
better to wait until it's 100% reliable." Donncha's belief that the
fix needed more venting is sound, and a number of fixes to it have
been made since then.

Maybe becomes I'm sensitive to it after being the QA owner for
security issues on Netscape 8 and then Flock, but the perception that
WordPress has a poor security record is an issue close to my heart. I
say "perception" as I don't have the expertise in PHP or web apps of
this nature to know how founded it is, but it still hurts and I hope
people with the expertise and passion will shape the path to changing
that perception (it is safe to assume that the core participants write
more secure code today than yesterday, as they have been to the school
of hard knocks, and take the security issues personally).

You can lead the horses to water, but if they aren't as thirsty as you
they won't drink. Or, actions inspire more than words, and mostly I
just got words,

Message-ID: <5cc93d950802031015w2a8d3ba7ic8f8f572a571fe35@mail.gmail.com>

Hello
want to ask for support or code help to develop a rss feed from a users
machine c++application, which is generating in a p2p style a list if top
webnews urls.
these urls then should be sent from the application to the blogpage of the
user.
So a rss feed could be used, that all the news each day is sent to the
blogging page,
Is anyone interested in coding such a plugin, second, how can the dynamic IP
of the users machine be solved, to communicate with the wordpress blog?
(not using dyn-dns). would it be possible to have in the word press software
a pull in method, so that the machine at home of the users can be reached?
or: that the users can press a button, to push the content of the url-list
each day from the machine at home to the wordpress blog ?
What is then needed, as wordpress has a rss feedb, but that needs a stable
ip, would it be possible, to habe a plugin in wordpress, that wordpress is
the stable IP, and users could push from their home machine each day the
content? e.g. the news of the day, or the bookmarks of the day of a user?
If anyone is interested to discuss that or expand any plugin for wordpress
to send each day the new bookmarks of a user to his wordpress blog, then
feedback is appreciated..
Thanks Mike

Sorry to ask this here but I've gotten no response on the forums or

No problem putting a static dir in the WP  docroot. But if you  
protect  that static dir with .htaccess, suddenly WP tries  to handle  
it and  gives a 404.

I tried adding "Rewrite Off" to the static dir's .htaccess, and also   
tried this trick:

... but no joy. Is is possible to have a static  dir with .htaccess   
auth protection?

<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"
href="http:/blah.com/comments/feed/" title="Records On Ribs Comments
RSS feed" />

How can I, within a plugin, replace these default feeds for the whole
blog with my own custom feeds that are from my plugin, and exist on
the pages the plugin generates? Sure, I can add an action to wp_head
but this won't remove the already existing feeds, thus confusing a
browser when they click the rss icon.

Thanks very much indeed.

I get your point, in that since no one was able to definitively point to a
specific time & version when their installations had been compromised there
was no solid proof yet that the very latest version still contained the
vulnerability. I'd still disagree with closing the ticket so quickly under
those circumstances, but I respect your differing opinion.

OK, my only point in my comments (that I keep repeating) is that in general
I think that we (including myself) could do better when it comes to
proactively hardening security in WordPress.

I'm not sure what else I can personally do in terms of "presenting
solutions" other than participating in these discussions in hopes of
encouraging people to that end, and contributing patches when I'm able, but
I'm open to suggestions.

If you disagree with my point (that we could do better in this area) that's
fine. You certainly invest a lot more time in it than I do, so perhaps
you're right. Either way, I'd rather not argue about it, since I don't think
that will be productive. I appreciate your responses, and I respect your
point of view.

Thanks,
Jared

Completely unusable if the plugin directory is symlinked to another location.

+1. I thought WordPress was about open standards and open source.

Flash is not an open standard nor open source. The argument for
including a Flash animation based on the fact that it is "ubiquitous" is
as bad as saying that we'll cut our development times by coding only for
MSIE, because it is ubiquitous, and now we only have one browser to code
for.

Is this not, when all is said and done, about user experience and ease of use?

Allowing a bit of Flash into the code isn't necessarily endorsing
every unopen and bad technology out there, its just using the right
tool for the job and degrading elegantly. The rest of Wordpress
doesn't suddenly close source and become invalid XHTML or open
standards because of this. Isn't this just another development
compromise - like
Wordpress being Mysql only or not using the Smarty template engine or
not making the core object orientated like Habari...

I don't see the big problem.

Without knowing the back-story to this thread, it reminds me of the 
fundamentals discussion in OpenLaszlo circles concerning 
Flash/Javascript after it went OpenSource.

This said - looking at the Flash uploader I am positive something
similar could be developed in js.

To my knowledge, no such thing has been demonstrated and it cannot be
done with HTML+JS+PHP. Flash is not being used to add UI or do
anything else that I know how to do in HTML+JS.

To clarify, what we get by using a Flash uploader is the ability to
select multiple files in the OS file dialog and the ability to monitor
the progress of each upload. Flash is not displaying the progress
bars; it merely triggers our JS callback which then updates the
progress bar.

Does anyone question the utility of these features?
Does anyone know how to accomplish the same experience without Flash?
Does anyone want to argue that improving the experience for the
Flash-enabled is wrong?
Does anyone have suggestions or code that can improve the uploader for
non-Flash users?

What is the utility of prohibiting distribution of a useful
open-source Flash program with WordPress on the basis that Flash
itself is not open-source? I hope that everyone will see that
WordPress is better for including it.

That seems cool, but I don't think multiple file selecting is all that
important, however you might be correct, in that HTML uploading doesn't
allow for this. However, I don't see how adding new html file inputs by
using JS can't be the same feature. A little less smooth, but most people
are used to that anyway.

No, in my opinion that is quite hot and the addition kicks ass.

> Does anyone know how to accomplish the same experience without Flash?

Yeah, but you won't like the requirements. In PHP 5.2, there is a Upload
Progress extension, but requires that the extension be compiled in PHP,
which I'm unsure whether or not it is by default. Last time I checked PHP
5.2 was not a requirement and checking for it and providing a JS solution
is obviously not something I think is worth the time/hassle of supporting.

> Does anyone want to argue that improving the experience for the

No, the flash vs JavaScript debate is pointless, in my humble opinion. It
is more like the debate between ASP.NET vs PHP or C vs C++. You can go
around in circles, but the fact is, is that Flash is supported widely
enough that most arguments don't stand up against JavaScript.

> Does anyone have suggestions or code that can improve the uploader for

Fall back to regular HTML file inputs and either use JavaScript or add
more by additional page loads as needed.

I think the main point of debate is more or less giving the source of the
Flash file (.fla) and including it with the distribution. I also think
that most would perceive it as a lot more difficult to edit/modify/fix,
because it isn't JavaScript.

However, I think most arguments can be broken down to that most people
can't work well with Flash (myself included) and so we are left out with
any future modifications. Also, do you know how much Adobe Flash costs?
Holy cow!

I'm neither for nor against the inclusion, since I rarely use the media
management. I'm also unsure where you guys put it, so I'm unsure what the
actual debate is about.

Message-ID: <54526ec20802032033l7a54e7dbvfdf0e3d302080b21@mail.gmail.com>

Hopefully, someone can tell me where I am going wrong with this?

I am in the process of updating my plugins for 2.4.x and beyond, and one of
them hooks into register_post (wp-login.php).

The old plugin only required one global, $errors, and in keeping with how
2.3.x and lower handled them, displaying the error message was only as tough
as using: *$errors['plugin'] = get_option('plugin_message');

*2.4-bleeding has changed the error stuff to a format like so:
*$errors->add('invalid_email',
__('<strong>ERROR</strong>: There is no user registered with that email
address.'));

*I have tried everything under the sun, globalized everything I could think
of, $errors, $error, you name it, and made sure that my error message
follows the pattern above, and yet for some reason I cannot get WP to "see"
my error.
I've went so far as to place a *var_dump( $errors ); *after
do_action('register_post'); inside wp-login.php, and of course, it sees all
the standard errors, but doesnt see the one I'm adding. Yes, the actual
checking is working.

Am I missing globals? Something else that I need to add? If I take the
plugin code and paste it right above the hook, it works -- so I'm obviously
missing something.

Ideas?

Thanks in advance

Yeah, you are too late and that was shot down fairly quickly in the debate
as it would require too much work to maintain.

You are looking the wrong place for the errors. Most of the time when
errors are encountered, they are redirected. In the process of wp-login,
you'll want to look in either wp_signon() (pluggable.php??), or
wp_safe_redirect() for a filter of some kind, or login_header() for a
filter. If none exist, then I guess the WordPress source doesn't want to
you see the errors.

There are no other actions or hooks that reference the errors, so I
suppose you are SOL in WordPress 2.5. You can lobby for them to add an
action that references the errors before the redirect.

Come to think of it, if it worked in WordPress < 2.5, than it should also
work with WordPress 2.5 and a regression occurred. A trac ticket should be
filed to add the same behavior back in.

I have not used the uploader period, because as I said, I have not been 
able to find the new uploader. I'm sure it is awesome, but I'm not going 
to uninstall Flash just to find out that it already does as I suggest.

Would be an easy way to DoS a site (e.g. for sites with >1000 posts) if
there were.

Except if your blog is hosted on sunriseroad.net, in which case _any_
page hit results in DoS'ing the site. ;)

Yes, please avoid this. I created a forehead-shaped crater in my desk
from when I was trying to share a single K2 installation between two
WordPress installations by using symlinks, and it was realpath()'s
fault.

No, but I did find it though, so thanks. Your tip only gave me enough 
hint to try to enable the RTE. In the future, or when creating the Codex 
page, you might want to mention the addendum below.

You have to have the checkbox "Use RTE" checked, I've always had it 
unchecked. I think that should be fixed so that I don't have to have it 
enabled to use the new media uploader. It doesn't appear to me to be 
dependent on the RTE, so it should work when the checkbox is unchecked.

 From what I can see, it is pure awesome and I don't notice the Flash 
elements. I haven't been following this thread to closely, so I'm unsure 
what exactly the debate is. It works fine for me and I don't think the 
majority of users will notice the flash or care that flash was used. 
That is in my humble opinion.

In many cases it's the only way to go.

for my plugin to work for 99.99% of the users that does not use symlink, 
I am willing to make the life of those who does harder.

Actually it's a good idea if it were paginated.  First 100 posts.   
2nd 100 posts, etc....

So please help me to understand this issue with this well-known plugin  
(Gengo) I'm trying to mantain:

http://code.google.com/p/gengo-wp23/issues/detail?id=34

I really can't understand what kind of directory structure actually it  
has, and if this is my plugin's fault or just an "extreme" setup I  
can't understand... I'm getting crazy :-)

By the way, this is not the only thing that's getting me crazy with  
this plugin, actually... it was not a good idea trying to mantain  
plugins authored by someone who disappeared (anyone knows him?!?). If  
someone of you are willing to make this multilanguage plugin work with  
a recent version of WordPress, have a look at

http://code.google.com/p/gengo-wp23/

and maybe help me find the way :-)

Thank you!

Let me check on what you're trying to do... You're making a
subdirectory under WordPress. You're trying to make that subdirectory
require basic authentication using .htaccess (and possibly a .htpasswd
file).

If that's correct, then add these lines to the beginning of
WordPress's .htaccess file:
ErrorDocument 401 /path/to/somefile.html
ErrorDocument 403 /path/to/somefile.html

Create a "somefile.html" somewhere. It can be blank, but it must
exist. I call mine blank.html.

Oddly enough, your authentication will then start working. The reason
is because of the odd combination of circumstances setup here. When
somebody tries to access that subdirectory, they are first denied
access with a  401 Unauthorized error code. This normally would be
sent back to the browser, and would cause it to ask for a
username/password.

However, WordPress' .htaccess file redirects everything to index.php.
Including that 401 error. This lets WordPress take over and suddenly
you're not sending a 401 back anymore, you're sending back the
WordPress page.

By forcing the 401 to point at an actual existing file, the
RewriteRule won't take effect, because of the condition that the
request not be asking for an actual file. That's the !-f part of the
WordPress rules.

The 403 doesn't necessarily need to be forced to a file, but it
doesn't hurt and might help in some edge cases.

I also have some troubles with trunk and the plugin I'm trying to  
mantain:

http://code.google.com/p/gengo-wp23/

In WP 2.3.2 the alpha8 version adds correctly language codes to pages  
(like /page-slug/en/) but it triggers an infinite URL rewriting loop  
in WP trunk (as of a week ago, the first time I've noticed it). I  
can't find in trac any changes, but probably I'm looking in the wrong  
place.

For what it's worth, actually I have some troubles with rewriting even  
with WP 2.3.2, but I'm trying at first to be sure it's not fault of  
mine; I'll share evidences if I'll find them.

jacob,

I think you don't understand my question. let me rephrase it.

Inside wp-login.php there is error checking, for the email address, for the
username, etc..

Like so, and this right out of the SVN:

*if ( $user_login == '' )
        $errors->add('empty_username', __('<strong>ERROR</strong>: Please
enter a username.'));
    elseif ( !validate_username( $user_login ) ) {
        $errors->add('invalid_username', __('<strong>ERROR</strong>: This
username is invalid.  Please enter a valid username.'));
*



For the sake of simplicity, lets pretend I have a plugin that checks that
the username is "jim" and will not allow the user to register unless the
username == Jim.

In *2.3* and below, this was simple:

if ($username != "Jim") //example only
        {
        $errors['deadbolt'] = get_option('deadbolt_message');
}

that was all it took, using only one global.

As you can see, 2.3 and 2.4 dont handle these "errors" the same way.

As far as the hook goes, its already there, has been for some time; its
register_post, and it's for just this purpose.

Heres another example, this might make it even more clear

In 2.3, if I had wanted to check for an email address at registration all
that would have been needed is this:


function email_check() {
        global $errors;
        global $user_email;
        if ($user_email != "secret@secret.org")
        {
        $errors['icky'] = get_option('icky_message');//set elsewhere
        }
        }

A 2.4 equivalent, with the changed error handling:

function email_check() {
        global $error;
        global $errors;
        global $user_email;
        //$errors = new WP_Error;
        if ($user_email != "secret@secret.org")
        {
        //$errors = new WP_Error;
        $errors->add('icky_email', __('<strong>ERROR</strong>: your email
blows.'));
        }
}


 a dump of the array containing the errors AFTER the hook, indicates that
the function is not adding the error to the error array.

I've found that this bug involves canonical.php in the same way bug  
#5023 affected preview pages:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5203

if I add to that array || is_paged() or || is single() the endless  
loop disappear and the paged archives works like a charm.
Can someone tell me if I'm doing right, and I have to submit a patch  
for this? I can't confirm the needs for this change without using my  
plugin, neither I'm able to understand if this have some downsides..

If you want to make the thing paged, just change the posts_per_page
number to how many you want to show on each page, then add some next
and previous link calls to make it paged.

This should be in the codex. It's one of the clearest examples I've  
ever read.
I'm just undecided on where to put it :-)

How about the examples section on:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/query_posts

That has a bunch of other examples, and it is linked from the 
all-encompassing resource page for themes and templates:

Is there any consensus as to whether people should be using  
wp_reset_query() at the end of custom query_posts() loops?

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4741

The function seems to be a really good idea, and it _is_ implemented  
-- but nobody seems to actually use it....

I've mentioned it on the forums before, but generally speaking I
prefer to discourage the use of query_posts() except to modify the
main loop for special cases. It's really better to create a new
WP_Query object and use that (for those "extra" loops you might happen
to need). That way the main loop for the page stays unmolested.

wp_reset_query() is useful, but only in special cases. Creating a
separate loop is usually more appropriate.

I forgot to update api.wordpress.org.  Should be fixed now.  You might
have to wait for WP to timeout its cache to see the proper message.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Logging API
Message-ID: <47A803DD.2040707@santosj.name>

I'm undecided on my own work. It feels dirty, somehow and I'm not sure 
how to improve it. I'm thinking I'm putting too much into the patch and 
should contain just the requirements. 
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5669 is the location of the bug and 
where the code is.

I tested the code and I do like how it works, very well. If I can 
convert parts of the WordPress core over to it, it should produce good 
results with reporting. Indeed, it is also possible to get rid of the 
error_reporting code completely by using the new API. There will be no 
need and will catch (based on PHP.net documentation) notices and warning 
blocked by the damn '@' character. This is both a boon and also an 
annoyance.

I've come to the conclusion that, in my opinion, the display code should 
not be part of the WordPress core and the only function(s) that should 
exist in functions.php are wp_log() and wp_log_error_handler(). I added 
wp_log_exception_handler(), but since WP_Error isn't an exception, it 
would be quite pointless to catch exceptions. It is doubtful, but 
probably only a handful that actually use exceptions in their code. 
However, my plugin does have exceptions (which I should catch anyway, so 
I have to add that to the todo) and it might be worth having a exception 
handler. However, it would require checking for the function existence 
and from the debug.php, it is quite ugly code and doesn't belong in 
functions.php. It should be left to the replacement.

I'm beginning to realize what pishmishy was getting at and the end 
result might end up looking like that person's draft. However, I would 
rather have some more eyes on it, if you will. I can see the increased 
benefit to core developers, plugin authors, and testers now.

I'm thinking have the wp-content/debug.php file used to supplement the 
functionality along with the non-pluggable wp_log(), which doesn't have 
to make use of the functions, the file could easily be moved to a plugin 
also, if WordPress also handled exceptions.

I think the latest addition is just fine. The display code was moved to 
a plugin and since the plugins hook into the shutdown action, the 
function has access to all of the globals and only need to open a file 
once to write all of the errors. I'm thinking this is better. WordPress 
core shouldn't be concern with the display of the functions and if 
WP_DEBUG is not defined, then error_reporting will handle everything as 
it should.

I'm unsure if this will get into 2.5 for plugins, but the work involved 
should at least give a starting point for further discussion for 2.6.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp-rewrite
Message-ID: <op.t51l21prk6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

I'm writing up a plugin at present, and i'm wanting to add in a rewrite rule for 
/custom_page_name?hash=13246

I'd like to map it so that i can catch custom_page_name, and re-map ?hash to the postname (To prevent wp_query having to make 2 requests to the database)

function tp_add_rewrite_rules( $wp_rewrite ) {
    $new_rules = array( "(custom_page_name)" => 'index.php?tp=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(1) );
    $wp_rewrite->rules = $wp_rewrite->rules + $new_rules;
}

Accomplishes the first part of it pretty simply(Note that i've allready added the tp queryvar/etc)

I was pretty sure i did this before:
    $new_rules = array( "(custom_page_name).*hash=(.*?)" => 'index.php?tp=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(1) . '&name=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(2) );
And it worked... But, I cant seem to get that working again, It simply breazes straight over the rule as the $request according to WP is now simply only "custom_page_name"

Upon looking through the sourcecode to find a better explanation, It seems to me that WP is trimming the query params off when doing the matching.. Yet i swear i managed to redirect ?hash=abc to the pagename yesterday..

Changing the input isnt a go-er as its a pre-made protocol i'm working with, And i'd prefer to prevent WP making a 2nd query to the database..

(Little background, I'm basically using the loop, But its being output in a custom way, and a custom input stream, the hash will allways be the post slug i'm after)

Any thoughts on how i should be going about this? Maybe i should be simply matching it myself using my own regular expression before WP does its wp_rewrite matches somehow?

I've come up with this version:

add_action('generate_rewrite_rules', 'tp_add_rewrite_rules');
function tp_add_rewrite_rules( $wp_rewrite ) {
    $new_rules = array( "(custom_page_name)" => 'index.php?tp=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(1));
    $wp_rewrite->rules = $wp_rewrite->rules + $new_rules;
}


And either of these:

add_filter('request', 'tp_request');
function tp_request($r){
	if( isset($r['tp']) && isset($_GET['hash']) )
		$r['name'] = $_GET['hash'];
	return $r;
}
OR:
add_action('parse_request', 'tp_request');
function tp_request($wp){
	switch( $wp->request) {
		case 'custom_page_name':
			if( isset($_GET['hash']) )
				$wp->query_vars['name'] = $_GET['hash'];
			break;
		default:
	}
}

It works as expected.. And am starting to think i was dreaming that my other method worked :P
I'll be using a few request lists hardcoded, so, probably use the 2nd method.

DD2 -

I think your second try is on the right track -- I've used a 
combination of generate_rewrite_rules and parse_request successfully 
to define custom URLs with custom behavior.

Another option that I have gotten to work is to use a combination of 
'query_vars' (to define 'hash' as a valid URL argument and query 
variable), and then adding some of the filters that modify the query, 
such as 'posts_where', 'posts_join', 'posts_groupby', 'pre_get_posts', 
etc. This may be a bit simpler and more direct.

Cheers Jennifer

I've got a feeling i might've been doing something stupid such as "(custom_post)/hash=(.*?)" when it was working first time around.. which would explainwhy it worked :P

I think using add_action('parse_request', 'tp_request'); will be the best method forward for me..

G'day,

Apologies if this has already been discussed, I've been off the list for 
a while and couldn't find it in my searching.

With the improvements to password hashing that are now in trunk and 
presumably will make it into core soon, is it also time to review the 
default password length?

I install a lot of WordPress sites, mainly for testing, and I notice 
that the passwords are predominantly numbers and only 6 digits long. As 
part of the password handling changes, can we push that out to 8 
characters and improve the random algorithm?

Cheers - Callum.

I definetely -1 this. I expect that the software I use has the ability to

The password generation function has been updated in trunk, although it 
still defaults to six characters length. The password generation 
function can be changed using a plugin if you wish.

I think Callum was simply refering to the default automatically generated passwords.

They're a 6 character(going off his post) hexadecimal number.

I dont see a need to increase the length, its a good length for remembering in your head while your setting up a new installation, and honestly, people should be changing that password as soon as they login, or if they've just reset the password.

I think you misunderstood my suggestion.

When you install WordPress it *automatically* generates an admin 
password. It's that auto-generation I'm talking about.

I agree, users can choose any password they like, that's up to them. But 
I think we should at least start out by generating a relatively secure 
password.

Cheers - Callum.

Ok, great. I'd support switching it to 8 characters by default.

While I know that some people will change their passwords, I also know 
that a lot of users simply won't. Personally, I don't bother generating 
new passwords when I create test sites because it's more hassle than 
it's worth for a testing site.

Changing the options via a plugin is fine for users updating their 
passwords, but doesn't work for the first admin password when the site 
is installed.

Cheers - Callum.

I haven't looked in the code - yet - but it seems to me that WordPress  
MU have a different algorithm, or at least random generated password  
looks slightly different from WP ones. I'll check it later, but maybe  
someone knows best.

What might also be useful would be if WordPress nagged the admin user until
they changed the default password.  I'm thinking like a bar across the top
of the admin pages with a link to where they can change the password.

Looking at the code in MU I don't think it is (was!). My main motivation 
with rewriting this code in trunk was to provide a default generation 
function with a greater character space than the output of md5().

Actually, I believe that default pwds as they are generated are way more 
secure than most password people pick ;P

Haha, you're probably right.  You just can't win with users can you?

Seriously, though, adding the functionality that wordpress.com has with the
tips and strength indicator might help.  It certainly couldn't hurt in any
case.

Message-ID: <20080206210519.6ee70577@Monza>

I am wondering if there is a way to stop and activation request.
Example:
A user clicks on activate in the admin->plugin menu
The script does a register_activation_hook($file, $function)

In the function there will be tables created but when they fail you
should see an error message, like the message when it succeeds but with
an error and the plugin isn't activated.

I hope it makes sense.

I cant find my previous posting on it..

But, As of 2.4/2.5 at least its easier to deactivate a plugin.
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5210


Simply register a activation hook:
register_activation_hook(__FILE__, 'plugin_Activation_hook_here');

function plugin_Activation_hook_here(){

if( <Check if other plugin is installed> || <Check PHP extension required is installed> ){
return; //Return, let the plugin activate.
} else {
//A requirement isnt met!
deactivate_plugins(__FILE__); //Deactivate ourself
wp_die("ERROR! You have not met a requirement of this plugin"); //add a more descriptive message of course.
}

}//end function


In 2.3 you need to do some array funky-ness to remove the plugins file from the active_plugins option array as the deactvate_plugins() function doesnt exist.

I run full date based permalinks, like this:
http://example.com/2008/02/06/hello-world/

For the longest time, WordPress would stick like a "-2" onto the end of the
stub if I tried to use "hello-world" again. Singular (
http://jamietalbot.com/wp-hacks/singular/ ) fixed this issue.

However, IIRC, didn't we at some point change this so that it would only do
it if there was an actual URL collision? i.e. it was changed to allow this:

Post #1: http://example.com/2008/02/05/hello-world/
Post #2: http://example.com/2008/02/06/hello-world/

It doesn't do it now though. Am I remembering incorrectly and it's added
prefixes this whole time or was the change broken / purposely put back? I'd
go back to using Singular, but I don't believe it even works anymore.

As I recall, that was discussed -- someone may have even made a patch,  
but I don't think it went in.

One issue we identified was that if your permalink structure is  
changed to something less specific (like to /year/month/slug/), you  
could introduce collisions.  Of course you'd have to redirect to the  
new URL structure, so maybe people with enough know-how to do that can  
also resolve slug conflicts.

It probably doesn't work without JavaScript, so if you had NoScript or
something running, you wouldn't have seen it.

When the permalink structure is changed (which is a fairly bad for SEO btw),
we could have it check for collisions and add in suffixes as needed.
WordPress already supports redirecting old stubs to new ones, so there ya
go.

Just drives me nuts that when I happen to make a post with the same name as
like a year ago, it sticks a suffix on it. :(

And apparently Singular DOES indeed work, so problem semi-solved.

The ticket is still open. There's a patch by JDTrower to enforce the 
same function using PHP. Less ajax goodness but it can actually enforce 
the requirements.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Special comments managemente
Message-ID: <sgllq35dd5nknnio4skq55adfc4qv7l8ed@4ax.com>

I've been asked to make a system to manage comments in a different way
than the usual one.

Every post will have 2 columns of comments a sort od 2 and only 2
categories (ex A and B). During omment post users should be able to
selec a radio button to choose the category of the comments A or B.

I suppose i shoudl have a plugin that:

1) When a comment is posted i ahve to intercept the post form read the
radio button, let WP save the comment and write a special new table
(created when plugin is activated) that assoicate the comment ID to
post category A or B

2) When post are showed i have to intercept the array and for each
comment check that special table to assign it to a category and then
output all the procesed comments in 2 divs that via css will show upp
as 2 columns.

I'm looking arounf to find the right Action or filter to use.. but i'm
not sure what to use.. any suggestion?

I didn't play with those filters, but I guess you need to look those:

> 1) When a comment is posted i ahve to intercept the post form read the
> radio button, let WP save the comment and write a special new table
> (created when plugin is activated) that assoicate the comment ID to

wp-includes/comment.php:476
	$comment_content = apply_filters('comment_save_pre', $comment_content);


> 2) When post are showed i have to intercept the array and for each

wp-includes/comment.php:94
	$_comment = apply_filters('get_comment', $_comment);

(this is for single comment)

wp-includes/comment-template.php:301
	$comments = $wp_query->comments = apply_filters( 'comments_array',  
$comments, $post->ID );

(this is for the array)




let me know if this help you :-)

Ok, I just figured out why I didn't see it.  It doesn't show up when you go
to edit a user, only when you go to the "Your Profile" tab under users.  Is
there a reason it's not part of the user edit form?  I'd hate to assume that
everyone with admin access knew what they were doing when it came to strong
passwords.

Can't wait for the #5 next summer! :)

Also, from a strict SEO perspective, I think it's rather negligible: 
adding a number to your slug doesnt add or take any SEO (keyword) value 
from it. Seems like the best option to me.

Since there would be exactly one boolean value attached to each  
comment, you should probably just add a column [saCategoryAB] or  
similar to the comments table.

I agree with this completely. in the codex query_posts() is presented
as the default/best way to solve the problem of multiple loops (and
for pretty good reason, it's very easy to use in conjuction with just
copy/pasting the other loop code).

But using query_posts() leads to a ton of weird behavior that I don't
think people expect at all, like, for example, when your category
pages no longer return true for is_category() because you used
query_posts() to get the 5 most recent posts site-wide for a widget or
something. The 'new WP_Query()' way is almost always what people want
because it leaves the original query variables alone.

It would be really nice to have a convenient wrapper function similar
to query_posts() but that has the behaviors of new WP_Query(). At this
point using the latter is relatively complicated and probably requires
actual php knowledge, rather than the simplified PHP knowledge that is
required for most other theme-related activities (i.e. using functions
and arguments but not much else). something like new_query()?

There might be a confound happening here.

a) From SEO perspective "rather negligible" is IMHO true about appending 
a suffix, as Ozh wrote here.
b) But if  Viper007Bond meant changing the permalinks of an already 
published blog when he wrote "When the permalink structure is changed" 
then that's true; it would be calamity for SEO if  (in effect) all those 
published articles disappear and an entire set of articles spring into 
existence as though new.

"URLs should be human readable"  is priority, but that has to come after 
"URLs should be stable / persistant".

At the least we might put in some way to turn it off.  I can see how  
people might like it either way.

Sounds like a plugin, Viper.

That's really not a minor change. The post_name is a primary key. It
can't have dupes.

I do not think that is accurate. Check the code... ID is the primary 
key in that table. There is an index on post_name, but it is not the 
type of index that requires all entries to be unique.

I don't know of any conscious decision as to why it is not on the user 
edit form.  With my patch (I just posted a revised patch that is 
compatible with the latest revision) if the administrator has enabled 
the function under settings>general that enables strong passwords, the 
PHP function will work on both the user edit form and the "Your Profile" 
tab.  If it isn't enabled, then that function won't run.  There is some 
JavaScript that will (unless JS is disabled) ensure that the password 
entered on the "Your Profile" tab achieves a password strength of 
better, strong, or very strong.  To test out the PHP function go to 
ticket #4470 and download the patch /password-strength-meter-revised2.diff/

If there is support to having the visual meter on the user edit form as 
well, I can add that code and post a new patch.

Try the "Media" plugin in TinyMCE (on the second row) or paste the code 
in "HTML" view. It should work good.

Hello all,

Sorry about the monstrously late reply, the problem had just slipped
out of my mind.

First I want to stress on one of the goals of this feature: to work
for both plugins and themes.

Although westi's method of explicitly defining the metadata in php
code is cleanest and is easier to deal with on our side, it will have
two side effects, which are not desirable:

1. Breaks current scheme.

It won't be easy to trick theme authors into adding a special php file
and calling functions and escaping strings just for writing their
plugin description. Users will want to use their old themes, so we
won't be allowed to deprecate comment headers. Ever. Of course, since
old headers are allowed, theme authors will continue using them. We
can push for the new ones of course -- but I don't think the gain is
worth it.

2.  Harder to parse, without including the php file.

Again, we can't make all plugin developers to start offering their
plugin in a directory with a special, metadata php file. If we allow
them to call the register_plugin function in the main plugin file, we
will have to either include it before it has been activated or try to
parse the strings out of it.

I really like the idea, but I wouldn't vote for it.

Running the metadata through translate -- it twists the idea behind
gettext, but could work very well. We can create both shell scripts
and web interface for generating pot files, which will add the medata
to it. It is totally doable and is a matter of hours. I would happily
volunteer to write the code, which does the extraction and formatting
it for gettext.

Apart from this one, I have another idea: we can keep the metadata
translations in the plugin repository.

First, imagine users can add plugin/theme translations to the
corresponding official repository (through the web interface) and the
translations are visible in the extension download pages. When
accepting a translation we can ask the translator to give us the
description, etc. in her language.

Once we have the translations, they will be available through simple
API and WordPress will download and cache the appropriate
descriptions. On certain plugin  events: e.g. upgrade metadata will be
downloaded again.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Message-ID: <47AC2DAD.8080905@szub.net>

Before submitting a ticket on this I wanted feedback from the gallery: 
Attachments, whatever sort of media we're talking about, ends up as a 
special kind of post in the posts table. So why shouldn't they have tags 
like posts and Pages do?

I can't come up with a reason they shouldn't other than lack of interest 
  incorporating a tags field in the Uploads/Media Library editor. 
However, I've begun to see the use of being able to tag attachments.

While I'm at it, why not custom field metadata for attachments?

+.5 It sounds reasonable, but attachments have never been shown
separate from the post/page it contains in WP.  You would need some
kind of change the UI that if they clicked on a tag it would return
posts and attachments.

I'd have to see a proposed programmatic solution before I could say
yea/nay.

 never is a long time, ;-),

its not just about presentation/front-end but also processing & organizing
data in a consistent & predictable way - especially when plugins come into
play - this approach would probably be good for interoperability of
WordPress plugins

http://szub.net/visuals/rlc/pastel-sketch/

I won't go into all the backend stuff going on at the link above, but 
basically, Pastel Sketch is an attachment (image displayed on that 
'Page') tied to my 'rlc' Page. The other links on the right sidebar 
under 'RLC Image Project' are also attachments.

Let me stress this: They are not child Pages to the 'RLC Image Project' 
Page, but rather attachments.

They can exist as posts/Pages in their own right. They can have comments 
and such. But presently they're barred from having post metadata (tags 
and custom fields).

I've not yet tested, but I'd be interested in knowing if the taxonomy/

Hi, Nikolay

First of all, I like the idea of using the gettext translation on the
metadata. It requires no extra effort from the plugin author and will
be backward compatible. However, one issue I can see is that it would
mean that each plugin will need a set of po/mo files, stored in a
folder structure. This will force some simple one-file plugin in the
folder /wp-content/plugins/ to be organized into subdirectories.

Your new idea of keeping the metadata in the plugin repository sounds
good, but I am not really seeing how you are going to implement that.
Does it mean that if the user installs a blog with a specific locale,
the plugin/theme metadata for that locale will be downloaded and will
be used to replace the original English metadata? If the blogs have
multiple authors and each one uses a different locale, would it be
possible?

Thanks.

Actually, even with MO files, you can install the plugin (and its MO 
file or files) in the top-level directory, so that isn't an issue.

However, there is one issue I can see with this idea of scanning the 
header with a special script: some plugins are internationalized, so 
they already have PO/MO files. Those plugin authors would have to have 
a way of getting the header strings into their main PO/MO files. 
Normally, you use POEdit (or similar software) and tell it to scan the 
files -- it looks for text in __() and _e() PHP functions, not for 
plugin header information.

Hi, Jennifer

I know you can install MO files in the top-level directory, but it
will be a huge mess.
Anyways, the problem you pointed out for the POEdit users will be a
hard one. It does impose extra work for plugin authors when preparing
the PO file. However, Nikolay was saying that it will be easy to do
with shell commands or in a web interface. So I guess an easy web
interface might be able to do the trick for the plugin authors who are
not thrilled with shell commands.

This make developers MUST have theyr plugin to the repository, the
metadata are translated with the localization of the plugin or it's
quite useless if not bad to have a plugin description in locale
language but the whole plugin (option pages, help etc) in english.

Would be different if the repository will offer the option to
traslation team to have access to the .pot file and metadata for a
plugin and a metod to upload locale files. This would encourage
developpers to make plugin I18N (lot doens't do yet specailly in the
them side, and this, IMHO caused by the fact that WP never come out
with a release with theme internationalized) If this would be done on
theme also would be great, pushing dev to make stuff I18N is important
and reduce the works for translation teams that actually have really
few resoursce localized in theyr language (20% or so of theme and
plugin used are localized)

We should have a more flexible po creation script so that we can parse
meta comments, providing the feature we want (localized meta) while
keeping annoyance to 3rd-party devs at a minimum (zero).

Is our po creation script not open source? ;-)

The problem with this idea is that people who internationalize their 
plugins and themes do not generally use WP-provided tools for making 
PO and MO files. They generally use third-party tools such as POEdit. See:

Deeper problem: ultimately accessible PO-making tools are not provided
by WP. How about a web form that uploads a theme or plugin and returns
a PO?

I didn't know about Ryan's i18n script until today. Now I'm looking at
it and thinking it would not be hard to augment the theme script to
locate the meta comment in style.css and to create a script to treat
plugin files the same way.

The logic: locate a comment beginning near the top of the file, split
it just like WP does, and put all the strings in the PO.

Then, WordPress core can filter the meta strings through __ as a
callback to avoid getting caught by xgettext:
$title = call_user_func('__', $title);

Why should WP be providing tools for what is a much more general 
problem, internationalizing applications with gettext? We don't 
provide web browsers, text editors, PHP debuggers, or any of the other 
tools that developers might use.

Just my 2 cents -- these translation tools have been around for a 
while, are used on other projects besides WP, and I don't think WP 
wants to get into the business of creating new tools for plugin devs.

There are a bazillion such tools for pulling strings from custom file
format X, and custom wrappers around xgettext are part of the build
process of many projects.  We could make our plugin headers compatible
with one of the many extraction tools out there, but we already have a
heaping helping of plugins using our custom format.  A simple PHP
script ( I hear WP plugin authors have PHP installed :-) would get the
job done, and maybe the plugin repo can offer pot generation so that
no tool is needed.

That would be a really cool feature, and yet another incentive for
people to get hosted.

My 2 cents feature request: the parser should be able to parse for
__(), _e() or any custom string. I like to use myplugin__() as an
alias for __($string, 'myplugindomain')

Something that is not PHP code should not be in PHP code. It should be in a 
configuration file.

I use YAML for all my configuration, it's easy to read and write and there are 
good parsers for it available.


A proposal:

---
name: My Plugin
description: >
    My Plugin is a very nice
    plugin for Wordpress.
author:
    name: Knut-Olav Hoven
    url:  http://www.hoven.ws/
.locales:
    nb:
        name: Mitt Innstikk
        description: >
            Mitt Innstikk er et fint
            tillegg til WordPress.
# END


When parsed using SPYC we get the following data structure:

Array
(
    [0] => --
    [name] => My Plugin
    [description] => Plugin is a very nice plugin for Wordpress.
    [author] => Array
        (
            [name] => Knut-Olav Hoven
            [url] => http://www.hoven.ws/
        )

    [.locales] => Array
        (
            [nb] => Array
                (
                    [name] => Mitt Innstikk
                    [description] => Mitt Innstikk er et fint tillegg til 
WordPress.
                )

        )

)



This provides default data, with posibility to override it with data from the 
locale of choice.


Other data that can go into this file is:
- version numbers
- release date
- changelog
- plugin url
- compatible with (wordpress versions)

Subject: [wp-hackers] TinyMCE 3.0 integration
Message-ID: <47AE2C65.1030905@laptoptips.ca>

TinyMCE 3.0 final seems to be working well. Over a week since it was
added to trunk and no major bugs reported (yet). However there are
several things that can be improved.

For example: can somebody with experience in dealing with MSOffice
produced html have a look at the configuration of the "Paste" plugin.
There are several options for it and some custom cleanup can be added as
a callback if needed:
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Plugins/paste

I'm also looking in the gzip compressor (tiny_mce_gzip.php). It works 
well, but half of what it does seems pointless.

- It starts with the server generating some js with php (the init 
array), then sending it to the browser.

- The browser runs it through couple of js functions, and sends most of 
it back to the server as a GET request.

- The server then uses the GET vars (that are exactly the same it 
generated in step 1), gathers the different pieces of TMCE, compresses 
them and sends them back to the browser.

I don't see the point of sending the init array back and forth, as all 
the settings the compressor needs to gather TMCE's pieces are available 
in the beginning. I've merged tiny_mce_config and tiny_mce_gzip. It's a 
bit faster, a bit more reliable (eliminates possible errors in the first 
two steps), and will eliminate some of the problems with TMCE when the 
browser uses cached copy of the init array.

To implement this in WordPress we will have to change two actions into 
filters. This will break a few plugins, so there's compatibility 
function that capture the output (the actions are outputting js) and 
insert it into the gzipped file.

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5807

Comments/opinions are welcome :-)

Nice to see filter -> mce_external_plugins

Starting to standardize the methods for adding TinyMCE functionality  
and buttons is going to hurt some folks, but  would be good in the  
long run. It will eliminate some very icky conflicts that happen now  
because there are several ways you can hack TinyMCE for WordPress.  
I've seen plugins shim JS directly into the head of editing pages and  
the tiny_mce_config.php. It's not very nice.

Hmm, I'm not seeing this now? I haven't even been online in a couple 
days, so I haven't even sent Dreamhost customer support any emails about 
the memory issue... I still just think it's them doing their normal 
"upgrades/maintenance" on their servers or whatever. All my sites are 
hosted by them, and they all are like yo-yos... few days they are up, 
few days later they down... ANYTHING that could possibly go wrong does, 
so... I dunno. I'll have to send them an email then...

This sounds like a patch feature request for a bigger issue:

what will it take to have

__($str) and _e($str) just work without having to specify the
translation domain?

IE: what if they used the translation of the current plugin automatically?


I suggestion a solution for this 9 months ago here:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4260


be sure to go through the thread mentioned to understand the context of
the proposed solution.

Just wanted to note that in my experience using the general tools is
about as fun as things like configuring your own Linux distro, which
isnt' to say that it's not fun, but that it's not fun for everyone and
lots of people probably get stuck (i.e. me) and just avoid the whole
i18n scene. That's not WP's fault, it's just a solution built by and
for (Linux) programmers, so it doesn't necessarily fit with the skills
and desires of everyone who might otherwise contribute to wp (theme
developpers especailly).

Also, WordPress doesn't provide text editors, but they do provide a
plugin repository and a theme repository, so if people also need help
specifically with the internationalization of wp plugins and themes, I
think that wp is in a privileged position to provide that help for the
sake of the people who need the translations to be possible.

That said, it should obviously be possible to translate your plugins
and themes WITHOUT using whatever tool WP would conceivably provide,
but having it there for the noobs sounds like a very good idea (if
it's something that could be put together quickly).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Renamed hooks
Message-ID: <b3ac26c20802111022v7b3f50d4se4dd038708fe7bdd@mail.gmail.com>

In WP 2.3, several hooks were renamed to have a variable name. For
example, "publish_post" now  appears in the source as
"${new_status}_$post->post_type". By request from some WP users, I'm
updating the WP hooks database [1] to give clearer information about
these renamings. (As it stands now, the database says that hooks like
"publish_post" no longer appear in the source, which is misleading;
that's what you get from a regular expression-driven database.)

There's one problem. For a handful of hooks that disappeared in 2.3, I
can't figure out what the new hook is (if any). I need help. I've
created a Google Spreadsheet [2] that lists all 37 hooks that
disappeared in 2.3 (in the first column). The second column shows what
I *think* the new hook is. Note that for a handful, the second column
is blank. For reference, you can find a list of all the new hooks
(including all the new variable hooks) that appeared in 2.3 here: [3].

If anybody can correct or add to that Google Spreadsheet, please let
me know. I'll update the spreadsheet as I get responses. As soon as
I've got all the info I need, I'll be able to update the hooks
database.

Here are the URLs you'll need:
[1] WP Hooks database
http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks

[2] Google spreadsheet

It won't let me edit your spreadsheet. However, here's some:

link_description has not been removed, it's now done by the
sanitize_bookmark_field function. Same goes for link_rating, although
it's been deprecated in general.

Note this line in bookmark.php:
$value = apply_filters($field, $value, $bookmark_id, $context);

These are both $field when they are pulled out and sanitized.

apply_filters('tiny_mce_before_init', $initArray)

do_action('mce_options') is deprecated

apply_filters('mce_browsers', array('msie', 'gecko', 'opera', 'safari'))

apply_filters('mce_external_plugins', array()) is new

I can't find on forums/wiki any information about how essential is the

it has a lot of usernames with the character "-". So, can I modify the
sanitize_user() function to allow users with the character "-" or it will
have some bad consequences?

I think there will be a little problem.
usernames can contain spaces, and sanitization replaces spaces with a
dash ("angus young" -> "angus-young")
If you do what you're thinking about, you won't be able to tell if the
sanitized dash is a space of a dash, so "angus young" and
"angus-young" will have the same sanitized username.

Makes sense?

So why not use "angus-young-2"? I mean, I thought that you of all people

Hi,

I've uploaded a plugin I wrote: 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comments-statistics/

The plugin page was wrong in readme.txt. Meanwhile, I've launched 2 
other versions of the plugin (0.2.1 and 0.2.2), but the one which 
appears on the page is 0.1

I've already erased the SVN repository and send the new ones, but they 
only appear if I click in "Other versions".

Can someone give me a hand on this mess, please ?

Well right now your SVN directory is empty:
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/comments-statistics/

So I guess they can't create a new page for your plug-in.

Thanks Otto. The hooks database is now updated to connect old hooks to
their new variable names. It's been getting heavy traffic the past few
weeks, probably from folks on this list mostly, so let me know if
there's something that you would like to see improved in it.

Andrew, I don't see those changes in 2.3.3. I'm guessing they're in
trunk? I'll deal with those ones when they show up in a stable
release.

That repository needs to contain the following directories:

trunk/
tags/

trunk/ holds the in-development version of you plugin and tags/  
contains sub-directories each with a released versions of your plugin:

tags/0.2.1/
tags/0.2.2/
...

At a minimum, trunk/ and each tags/sub-directory/ should contain a  
readme.txt file and a WordPress plugin file.

readme.txt files need to follow the following standard format:
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/comments-statistics/readme.txt

A WordPress plugin file is a PHP file with a plugin header:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Standard_Plugin_Information

By default the WordPress Plugins Directory will use the trunk/  
version of your plugin.  If you want to tell it to use one of your  
tagged versions (a version in a tags/sub-directory/), you must  
specify in trunk/readme.txt a "Stable tag" line such as the following.

Stable tag: 0.2.2


So, for your Display Comments Statistics plugin, your repository  
should look like the following.

trunk/readme.txt
trunk/dcs.php
trunk/... (other files)

tags/0.2.1/readme.txt
tags/0.2.1/dcs.php (the old 0.2.1 version of you plugin)
tags/0.2.1/...

tags/0.2.2/readme.txt
tags/0.2.2/dcs.php
tags/0.2.2/...

And your trunk/readme.txt file should look something like:


=== Display Comments Statistics ===
Contributors: gamito
Tags: comments, stats, statistics
Stable tag: 0.2.2

Display comments statistics about platforms and browsers.

Subject: [wp-hackers] adding array to query vars
Message-ID: <47B1F898.5080202@gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to add an array to the query variables, but this seems not 
possible using add_query_var filter or at least I haven't found a way to 
do this.

My objective would be to get access to a variable holding all active 
checkboxes and use this to retrieve a set of post based on these 
parameters.

Could someone please explain to me how to add a variable of the type 
array to the WP_Query object? I know it is possible as there are query 
variables of this type such as tag__in

Thanks,

All the best

grtz

Subject: [wp-hackers] tags, categories and selecting posts
Message-ID: <47B21611.8000805@gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to use a category and some tags to select a post in the 
2.3.x version of Wordpress?

Something along the lines of:

http://website/?cat=3&tag=foo&bar would give me all posts tagged with 
'foo' and 'bar' in the category with id 3

I can see that there is some function get_objects_in_term() in the 
taxanomy.php file which seems to do what I would like to achieve.

Is this already working in Wordpress, if not is it desired to get this 
working in the core? If yes, how can I be of asisstance?

All the best and thanks in advance,

grtz
BjornW

just refer them here.

w00t! I'll put in this:

function muahahaha() {
	header('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');
	header('Location: http://jeremy.visser.name/'); // coolest site around
}
add_action('init', 'muahahaha');

It is possible,  but it requires sorta abusing the API a little (I use it
for magic purposes here: http://www.neato.co.nz/tag-search-experimental/ p.s.
it is an experimental interface.  May cause birth defects, randomly display
white pages because I'm editing things etc. etc.).

Roughly,  if you make a query with the categories and explicitly use the
tag_slug__and (or tag_slug__or) query parameters;  then you'll end up with
posts that match the category and tags.

(The way I use it,  I create my own query object and set a bunch of
parameters;  since I'm conditionally using a bunch.  And I just like it
better that way.  Alternately,  if you pass query_posts an array of values
instead of a query string;  I understand that also does the business.)

So the short answer,  is that you kindof can already it's just not all glued
together properly (:

Message-ID: <47B2E764.1070309@interconnectit.com>

Hi,

I'm wondering why the html generated by wp_list_pages and 
wp_list_categories has changed in the current 2.4-bleeding. I know 
things in this are not set in stone so I'm hoping it's not a permanent 
change as it makes coding CSS menus that work with 2.3 and 2.4 very 
difficult especially as child item are no longer in a single container.
The new structure also makes less sense semantically as each child is 
now a separate UL.

Changed from:

<ul>
  <li>
   Text
   <ul>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>text</li>
   <ul>

Hi Christine,

Could you eloborate a bit more about the query part? I've re-read your 
email a few times and looked at your experimental interface, but I can't 
seem to get my head around the query building part.

In the end it would be very cool if I could use the URL to access this 
behaviour...sort of a poor man's API ;)

All the best,

grtz
BjornW

I can't think of a technical reason for that change to have been
implemented.

Could you raise a ticket on trac (and write a patch if you can track
down what has changed to cause this)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Stability of admin...
Message-ID: <47B30551.1070307@poplarware.com>

Since WP 2.5 is coming out March 10 with major changes (at least, the 
schedule still says that), and we're about at the "freeze" time frame, 
my question for today is:

Are the features of the admin section, composition and layout of the 
admin nav menus, markup of the post/page edit screens, and hooks and 
other API functions related to the admin section pretty much stable 
now for 2.5? In other words, can plugin authors whose plugins add 
sections to post/page edit screens, and/or pages/tabs to the admin 
menus, start updating their plugins for 2.5, or are we still shooting 
at a moving target?

In a related question, did someone write a simple function for plugins 
to use to generate wrappers for a post/page edit screen section? (Ryan 
had mentioned that was in the plans at some point in an email 
discussion, as a good way to support migration to the new wrapper markup.)

If there are still layout/markup/API changes coming that make WP 2.5 a 
moving target for plugin developers, how can those of us who might 
have time help stabilize it? (Pointing to bug #s in trac, or creating 
them, would be helpful so we can write patches.)

Thanks,
     Jennifer

I've been going through some of the older tickets in trac, bumping 
suggested features up to 2.6, leaving genuine bugs at 2.5 and 
reconfirming admin interface bugs.

Guess I should have caught up on RSS this morning. :) So that answers 
part of my question, but a feature freeze is not the same as a 
layout/markup/API freeze...

There could still be bugs in the layout/markup.

I believe Ryan has added some api for Post boxes.

I don't think we could guarantee being stable layout/markup wise until
we go Beta.

Well, you could fix the bug preventing it from working:

Yes.  You are free to suggest this on the ticket especially if working
patch exists.

Subject: [wp-hackers] tags and categories combined not working: is it a bug
	or a feature?
Message-ID: <47B3170A.9080004@gmail.com>

Hi,

After some trial and error and some pointers by Christine and people on 
IRC it seems that using both 1 tag and 1 category produces SQL code but 
no results. However using multiple tags and 1 category does give back 
results. This is odd as there should be a result both times. Perhaps 
this is a bug?

== what I did ==
I have a lot of posts which belong to categories. Every post belongs to 
at least 2 categories, namely a parent category and a child.

i.e.
parent category: mediaskills and awarness
child category: media-awarness

Every post has also been tagged with at least one tag and mostly with 
more than 2.

i.e.
elderly, kids, teens

Now I would like to get all posts in the category media-awarness (let's 
say the id for this is 12) with the tags 'elderly' and 'kids'. I do this 
using query url parameters:

http://mediawijsheid/?tag=ouderen+kinderen&cat=12

This results in the following query code which I dumped using
<?php global $wp_query; print_r($wp_query) ?> in the search.php template:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts INNER JOIN 
wp_term_relationships ON (wp_posts.ID = wp_term_relationships.object_id) 
INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy ON (wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id = 
wp_term_taxonomy.term_taxonomy_id) WHERE 1=1 AND 
wp_term_taxonomy.taxonomy = 'category' AND wp_term_taxonomy.term_id IN 
('12') AND wp_posts.ID IN (7, 8, 17) AND post_type IN('page', 'post') 
AND (post_status = 'publish' OR post_status = 'private') GROUP BY 
wp_posts.ID ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10

And I get the results I would expect. When I want to get all posts in 
the category media-awarness (still using id 12) and just the tag 
'elderly' I get the following SQL code and no results :

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts INNER JOIN 
wp_term_relationships ON (wp_posts.ID = wp_term_relationships.object_id) 
INNER JOIN wp_term_taxonomy ON (wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id = 
wp_term_taxonomy.term_taxonomy_id) WHERE 1=1 AND 
wp_term_taxonomy.taxonomy = 'category' AND wp_term_taxonomy.term_id IN 
('12') AND wp_term_taxonomy.taxonomy = 'post_tag' AND 
wp_term_taxonomy.term_id IN ('19') AND post_type IN('page', 'post') AND 
(post_status = 'publish' OR post_status = 'private') GROUP BY 
wp_posts.ID ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 10

What the heck is going on?

Any help much appreciated!

All the best,

grtz

Look closely at the WHERE clause:
WHERE 1=1 AND
wp_term_taxonomy.taxonomy = 'category' AND
wp_term_taxonomy.term_id IN ('12') AND
wp_term_taxonomy.taxonomy = 'post_tag' AND
wp_term_taxonomy.term_id IN ('19')

That's not possible. No taxonomy can both equal 'category' and 'post_tag'.

Trac ticket is here: http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5433
I attached a potential patch to that ticket. Have not tested it yet,
so don't know if it will work.

Ok, Otto just mentioned a bug (http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5433) 
which seems exaclty what I encountered.

Thanks Otto for mentioning this!

ps:Just out of curiosity how do you use Trac in order to find these? I 
searched through it but this never came up...

All the best,

Because WAMP/LAMP and therefore WordPress are so easy to setup (there
are also prepackaged virtual machines), I wonder as to the usefulness
and appropriateness of demo sites, specifically for a release still in
development.

You're kidding, aren't you? Not everybody is able to setup a LAMP/WAMP
server and install WordPress. Not everyone wants to install a VM engine.
And not everybody is able to use SVN to always run the latest version. 

As for me, I do see the benefits of a demo installation, especially a
self-upgrading one.


Best regards,
Alex

This is almost certainly due to one of the changes to the walker
classes. There have been quite a few.

Hi,

I was already looking at the walker class, the problem seems to lie at 
line 445. It calls the end level function if the depth is greater than 
zero rather than checking that the level is less than the level on last 
run through. For eg if the depth on last run though was 3 and the depth 
on this run through is also 3 then it should be called, if on the next 
run through the depth changes to 2 then we should call it if it goes up 
to 4 we should not. I'm not sure if this would cause problems for the 
none UL LI version of the page and cat lists.

Thanks,

James R Whitehead

Of course, everyone is not, wants not. But every member of wp-hackers can.

I shudder the same way when people throws out the general question on
wp-hackers or wp-testers if it is safe to run on their site. Feelings
like setting themselves up for disaster.

General demos and demo sites of pre-beta software has always seemed
like a good way for people to get their feelings hurt -- specifically,
people getting expectations that aren't met.

Cheers,
Lloyd

Good work on the patch draft Otto.

Christine, the page you linked looks amazing! I've been dreaming of
somthing like that for a long time. Will it be a plugin or are you
planning to release the code in some way? (I'd love to see it even if
it's just the experimental code).

I think considering the level of user interest in Wordpress, and
specifically the changes to the administration interface which come
with 2.5, having a demo site is actually entirely necessary. It
creates a far better interaction between end users and developers for
one.

Providing people are aware that this is pre-beta, which they are, I
don't see any problem with it. No one in their right mind would think
it production ready. Even if they asked, it would be simple to say no,
and no one monitoring this list would ask as they know the state of
play.

As for every member of wp-hackers can, well, I could. I can use svn
and my home server as much as the next guy. Can I be bothered to mess
around setting it up when I all I am interested in is seeing what
changes have been been made, partially at a purely aesthetic level?
No, even when it would take only about 20 minutes. I just want to be
able to log on and have a quick look, and this demo site amply
provides for this.

Regards

Alex

It also creates a level of pre-release hype, which can never be a bad
thing for big changes...

Ok, I thought that you meant that every potential WordPress user can. I
understood that the test site set up by Chris is especially for the
"usual" WordPress users, who might want to have a look at the new Admin
interface and discuss it (not at wp-* lists, but in the community).

Best regards,
Alex

There's been lots of talk so I'll let ya know why I did it.. I did it so anyone, able, not able, doesn't want to, etc. could check it out.. If someone on wp-hackers wants to look at it and doesn't want to take the time to set it up so that they can play with it for 5 minutes and be done, then so be it.. If Joe Wordpress heard something about a new version and wants to see it, they can.. I just used WP-hackers as a good way to let people know that if they *want* to try it out, they can, and if they don't want to, so be it. There's someone today on wp-testers who wants to see it, without having to install it. Given, he wants to see it because he wants to see if he can run it now safely, but he wants to see it none the less. That's what I put it up for.

Ok, I thought that you meant that every potential WordPress user can. I
understood that the test site set up by Chris is especially for the
"usual" WordPress users, who might want to have a look at the new Admin
interface and discuss it (not at wp-* lists, but in the community).

Best regards,
Alex

They _could_, but mightn't be _bothered_ if all they wanted to do is get
a sneak peek at the new interface.

Boy, why is everyone dissing Chris? He went to the trouble of setting up
a demo site because he thought there would be some kind of demand for
it, and now everyone's dissing him.

If there is demand, people will find the demo site useful. If there is
no demand, nobody will use the demo site. Life goes on.

Jeremy, yesterday alone I served up 331 MB and 197000 mysql queries. Demand? Maybe.

Agreed. The point is that if we ever need it, it's there. I think it
could become popular for demonstrating new features, answering questions
about WP-trunk, etc.

+1 to that.

If they don't see a need in a demo install, don't use it/comment on it. I
personally think its a great way for lazy people like myself to find out the
latest changes in trunk. Thanks for setting it up!

See, and I thought research was important when you're a hacker. Like,  
knowing what mailing lists you're posting to.

'course, I must be mistaken, I'm not a real hacker after all.

No, no, I think my comment came across the wrong way. I wasn't meaning to
diss Chris at all. I was merely saying that installing a webserver wasn't as
hard as Alex G?nsche had made it out to be.

Installing a webserver just to check out the new UI is indeed overkill and I
think Chris' demosite is a great idea, especially once he makes it properly
secure. :)

I did never say that it's hard to install a webserver. I administrate a
couple of server systems, and I know that it's not to hard. I also saw
people using XAMPP, and that seems to be even easier than managing
everything by hand.

What I said is that *not everybody* (meaning not everybody who might
want to try the new admin interface) is able to do it. And even most of
those who could, wouldn't do it *just for a preview*.

When you say "... installing a webserver wasn't as hard as Alex G?nsche
had made it out to be" then you might have misunderstood that "not
everybody is able to do it" or "not everybody wants to do it" does not
equal "it is hard to do it". Or, to make it fully clear, I did not mean
myself or anybody from this list, but normal WP users who might like the
idea to see the new WP.

Looks like some butthole redirected it to his site.
As it is a demo site with open admin access, that doesn't even require
any skills, it only requires being bastard enough to set his own site
URL in the WP Options. But maybe it also was stupidity, because that guy
wrote an article an links back to the original demo site.

Anyway, as the demo install will reset itself (according to Chris), it
should be back in less than a hour, assuming an hourly cronjob.

Best regards,
Alex

You can set the site URL in wp-config.php, it might be an idea to do that to
stop it happening again.

Chris,

I sent the link to your Wordpress 2.5 demo site to 3 of the most important
lists about WP and blogs from Brazil (yes, I'm brazilian). I think you made
a good job offering this opportunity. I was so eager to see the new version
of WP and, sincerely, I loved.

I know that WP developers have lots of things to make until the release, but
I just liked what I saw. Congratulations!

A little about me

I'm a 23-year-old brazilian web designer and web developer, I have a personal
blog <http://www.cadudecastroalves.com/> based on... hum... WP (of course)
and I'm a WP lover. I joined to this list to give more experience using WP,
to help and (why not?) to make some friends around the world.

Best regards,

Cadu de Castro Alves

Hi,

A very simple solution would be to add

$output = preg_replace("/<\/ul>[\t\n\r ]*<ul>/","",$output);

to wp_list_pages and wp_list_categories in post-template just before the 
apply filter. It might be considered a little crude but it would be more 
efficient than having a whole load of conditional checks in the walker 
class and keeps the walker easier to read.

Just my thoughts on things.

Thanks,

James R Whitehead

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin Feeds Conflicting With Main Application Feeds
Message-ID: <e9f3ce460802140522g5d1c4a37oc9c320c7c8a5a836@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

As I mentioned previously I'm adding custom feeds to my application
using the http://site.com/artists/artist_name/feed format. This
appears to be conflicting with the main wordpress feeds which would be
located at http://site.com/feed .

This is I suspect because somehow Wordpress mod_rewrite rules capture
everything with "feed" at the end of a URL and do something with it.
My re-write rules are conflicting with this.

Is this right and if so how would I go about solving this problem? Is
there some kind of "feed hook" I can latch onto where when my 'feed'
ending is called we get an interrupt and my plugin kicks in.

Regards

Alex

You just need to login directly to the admin (
http://wp.chrisjohnston.org/wp-login.php) every so often, and change the
site URL. Apparently whoever keeps changing the URL is too lazy to make it
terribly difficult to fix.

Looks like some butthole redirected it to his site.

Chris,

please make sure that people cannot modify the Blog options (at least
not the home and site URL settings). After every reset, some other jerk
redirects to his site.

Now that this thread has hopefully cooled down to a "lets actually
help him make it secure" level, I'll just point out that while XAMP
and MAMP make it stupidly easy to run a local web server (just tell
people to download a simple app and then run it), installing and
running SVN is WAY harder.

There's a lot of conceptual work involved in knowing what the hell you
even WANT from 'SVN', let alone deciding how you want to implement it
(what interface) and how to make it work with your web server. Reading
about it also tends to drop a lot of command-line advice that is hard
for non-programmers to parse. If WP had snapshots or something (not
saying it should or that it doesn't somewhere out there) then it
wouldn't be as big of a deal, but telling people to make system-level
changes so they can SVN-up the new unstable WordPress really is a
fairly big request, and for people who are just curious, I think this
site is a valuable resource.

That said, I think the important thing to remember (for Lloyds
concerns) is how anyone pointing to the site is talking about it. We
should never say anything like "this is the new wordpress", but
instead stick to descriptions like "WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA AND FOR
VIEWING ONLY!" (someone will break this rule but if most people are
responsible i'm sure WordPress' integrity will survive).

 Chris: It might also be worth making the fact that it's an Alpha
release clear in the title (so it's visible in the whole admin
section). Also, please hardcode the url as people have said before,
it's pimping venetian blinds right now :S

Most of the admin redesign is done.  There are still a few pages under
construction.  See here:

http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2008/02/14/pages-still-under-constructionupl/

We're ready to start fixing layout bugs and tidying things up.  We
have some IE problems that need to be fixed, some tables need column
alignment tweaks here and there, the post preview view needs
attention, and so on.  Submit your patches to trac and we'll get them
in.

Thanks so much for putting up the demo, it's cool that WordPress users have
the opportunity to see what 2.5 looks like.

I don't know if there are any plans to address this in 2.5 but my #1 wish
for WordPress is a subscriber interface that can work with the theme of the
blog, so subscribers don't see the backend at all (including the Dashboard)
when they are editing their profile/signing up to be subscribers.

There's been lots of talk so I'll let ya know why I did it.. I did it so
anyone, able, not able, doesn't want to, etc. could check it out.. If
someone on wp-hackers wants to look at it and doesn't want to take the time
to set it up so that they can play with it for 5 minutes and be done, then
so be it.. If Joe Wordpress heard something about a new version and wants to
see it, they can.. I just used WP-hackers as a good way to let people know
that if they *want* to try it out, they can, and if they don't want to, so
be it. There's someone today on wp-testers who wants to see it, without
having to install it. Given, he wants to see it because he wants to see if
he can run it now safely, but he wants to see it none the less. That's what
I put it up for.

Ok, I thought that you meant that every potential WordPress user can. I
understood that the test site set up by Chris is especially for the
"usual" WordPress users, who might want to have a look at the new Admin
interface and discuss it (not at wp-* lists, but in the community).

Best regards,
Alex

<snip entire discussion>

You can also mark certain tables as read-only in MySQL (I think), so changes
cannot be made....
I know it can be done on a schema-wide level, but I'm not sure if it's also
possible to do it to tables. IF it is, you can use it to lock down the
options, users, etc. tables from changing.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Codex on 2.5 plugin/theme migration...
Message-ID: <47B4D0DE.4000208@poplarware.com>

We might need a Codex article on migrating plugins and themes to 2.5. 
The last "migrating" article was for 2.1:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes_to_2.1

The only issues I know about right now for 2.5:

- Plugins are activated in a non-global scope, so you may have to add 
a couple of 'global' declarations to your plugin to get the activation 
to work.
- Format/markup of the post edit screen has changed, so if your plugin 
adds sections to this screen, it needs to do it differently.
- Admin menu has been reorganized. This didn't break any of my own 
plugins, though. I think I may have to make slight changes to the docs 
  (e.g. "Options" is now "Settings" and it's in the upper right 
corner), but probably nothing else. Anyone else having a different 
experience?

So, any comments, thoughts, etc.? Right now it might be a pretty short 
article, but I think it may still be worth writing. If you have 
thoughts about 2.2 or 2.3 migrations that should have been mentioned, 
let me know that too. Thoughts on that:
    2.3 - tagging (add to themes), canonical URLs (this bit me on a 
plugin)
    2.2 - widgets (make themes widget-compatible, add widgets to plugins)

Thanks,
     Jennifer

Sad thing is, Tags were added in 2.3. I still don't think everyone's 
themes are up-to-speed for em. Not to mention how many plugins/themes 
that needed updated for the last few versions of WordPress... I guess 
what I'm trying to say is, I wonder if they'd really care or not, to 
update their plugins/themes for 2.5? My guess is, Nope! =(

We can register some common globals within activate_plugin() and in
includes files where they are used outside of a function such as
schema.php.

Could do something like this:
if (function_exists(add_meta_box()) {
  // 2.5 style
} else {
  // 2.3
}

$wpdb would be the obvious choice. I also had to globalize a couple of 
plugin-specific variables.

Oh, I didn't see the add_meta_box function. I just followed what the 
other "advanced" edit sections on the default edit page were doing, 
and checked for the existence of the postbox_classes function as a 
clue that the new formatting should be used, within the 
dbx_post_advanced action function I already had in the plugin.

Where does add_meta_box add its box, anyway?

This would only be useful if the plugin author has their code outside of 
a function, which they shouldn't be doing anyway. I know of one plugin 
which makes this mistake, however, most plugin code, should contain its 
own functions and use add_action() and add_filter() functions. In any 
case, after thinking more about what you stated in the ticket and what I 
realized, it wouldn't matter if you place it in activate_plugin(). If it 
was such a hassle, then it would have broken all plugins in existence 
and it hasn't.


function bugtest_test_activate() {
    require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
}

should be:

function bugtest_test_activate() {
    global $wpdb;
    require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
}

However, if it existed outside of that function, like this:

require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');

function bugtest_test_activate() {
    global $wpdb;
   
}

Then it would be activate_plugin()'s fault. However, since the 
responsibility is on the plugin author and not the core of WordPress, it 
should then be up to the plugin author to first test for whether $wpdb 
is set and if not declare it a global.

if( !isset( $wpdb ) )
    global $wpdb; // Inside function scope.
require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');

function bugtest_test_activate() {
    global $wpdb;
   
}

This problem should not have been solely isolated on WordPress 2.5, 
since activate_plugins() has existed long before 2.5. Sprinkling 
extraneous global declarations where the variables should already be in 
global scope will confuse the hell out of developers ("Isn't this a 
bug?" No, some plugin author needs it).

This is all in my humble opinion. You learn something new every day it 
seems.


I agree with the rest of Jennifer's points as, there have been many 
times where I need a quick reference guide and the 2.1 information was 
practically worthless when dealing with 2.3 and 2.2 for that matter. 
Widgets as far as I can see are fairly easy to grasp, once you have a 
working example or two. There is also probable that the information 
already exists on the Codex, but isn't referenced anywhere or in a hard 
to find location, as is a lot of great priceless and awesome resources. 
I think it would help if the codex was more organized, but that would 
require an army.

Anybody else think that the "Log Out" link in the 2.5 admin should be to the
right of the other links? Looks a little weird where it is now, and having
it to the far-right is the usual with most sites, so it's easier.

Not really a problem or anything, just wondering why and such.

Message-ID: <f24a0219-3de6-4e38-b886-7461808bbdb6@s8g2000prg.googlegroups.com>

Group,

I would like to submit some IA/UI suggestions on the admin UI before
we close the book on it for 2.5.  I want to say that the new UI is
great, and I don't want to diminish the work that Happy Cog/Automattic
has done as they are far more talented than I.

You want to see an image before reading I know so here's my mockup.

http://flickr.com/photos/cpoteet/2266424936/sizes/o/

You'll notice that I've obviously moved a few things around.  The
first thing that struck me about the interface was that it included 5
different areas of navigation (not including the sub-menus) on the
prominent navigation.  I felt a need to make a clearer distinction and
combine/collapse some areas.

- I removed "dashboard" in lieu of having the h1 blog title link to
the dashboard.
- I changed around the main navigation.  I have also put together a
layout to the navigation that can be seen here:

http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1369362/

- I have changed "Write" into "Create", because you don't really
"write" links.  I felt it more consistent to describe all three.
- I moved "comments" next to "manage" although I think that maybe
comment moderation can be moved under "manage"
- I removed "Link categories" because all category moderation should
be on one page
- I combined import/export
- "Design" became "Theme" to more aptly describe the sub-content (the
page it links to is even named "themes.php")
- You'll noticed I moved the "Settings" up to the upper right.
Conceptually, I would like this to toggle via jQuery to present
options below similar to the navigation in the CodeIgniter
documentation (the toc): http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/
- The link to "visit site" was also moved up there.
- I removed "help" and "forum", because I found them more in line with
WordPress.com and not the stand-alone software.  That would be a good
place for them for WP.com
- I also included "Users" under "settings" because (1) it's only 1
page and (2) it's only 1 page because your user name in that same spot
links to the same thing

If any or all of this might be considered for the trunk then I will
happily generate the patch.

Having the Blog Title go to the Dashboard is unexpected and not clear. I
think Dashboard is fine where it is now.

I think it should stay as Write, it's clearer.

Meh, looks better on the far right (Plugins which add top-level menus will
ruin this though)

Design is better, as Widgets aren't really part of the theme.

I liked where Settings and Plugins was "originally".


> - The link to "visit site" was also moved up there.


Visit Site fits more beside the site name, as having visit site near the
user's name might confuse the user into thinking it will go to the site they
enter in their profile.

Help and Forums are related to WP.org. They might fit better in the footer
by leaving Documentation as it is, and changing Feedback to Forums.

I think Users should stay seperate, for Plugins to add menus under it.
I like that the Log Out link is on the far right, though. ;)

Which should be this, to avoid calling the function and to avoid calling 
the non-existant function:

if (function_exists('add_meta_box')) {
  // 2.5 style
} else {
  // 2.3
}

Yes. I wrote a plugin as a demostration:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tdo-tag-fixes/

You can see it in action here. Go any category and then the tag cloud
in the sidebar updates to show only tags within that category. Select
tag from the tag cloud and it'll list only posts in that category with
that tag.

For example:

http://thedeadone.net/moc/games/the-unfathomable-sea/?tdo_tag=equipment

Points to posts in the category_slug the-unfathomable-sea  with the
tag_slug equipment. You can use multiple tags too:

http://thedeadone.net/moc/games/the-unfathomable-sea/?tdo_tag=pc+background

Is that what you are looking for?

The main navigation tabs need looking at, basically tidying them up to look
more like the tabs here http://flickr.com/photos/cpoteet/2266424936/sizes/o/

Is anybody already doing this small fix, or should I whip up a patch to the
admin CSS?

I just meant fixing the styling on the tabs, not redoing the menus.
The menus have had lots of user testing done on them, and we'll leave
them as is for 2.5.

Chris I wasn't really talking about integrating any of your changes, just
fixing the current styling. Just using your design as a reference really. If
your changes are accepted then you can of course code them up yourself.

Okay so I have a fix for the navigation, and it all works great, except the
only way I could see making it work included a small image used as a
background, its only a small 1*1.gif so it wont affect page loading times.

I've also included a bugfix for IE6, where the current list item in the
submenu would have a blue background/border for some reason - that's now
gone.

Should I make these into a patch and submit it to trac?
I've never made a patch before :P

Some plugins add a submenu to Dashboard.  Also, having the explicit

I like that idea.

To Matt: How is "create" unclear?  It's specific but leaves a bit of  
room for flexibility.

Comments are a significant enough thing to warrant a top level menu.   
Also it would again mess up plugins that add submenus.

Sounds reasonable.

"Design" works better for the same reason "Create" is better than  
"Write" ;-)

What happens to submenus?

NO.  That should stay next to the site name.


Just my two bits.

I think I like the new admin interface, overall. :)

Is there anything special (other than having your plugin hosted at

plugin update notification work?  I updated my configurable tag cloud 
plugin today, and I'm not getting any notifications that there's an 
updated version available.

I really, really hate it myself. But only because the usability of it
has dropped to basically nil.

The Write posts page is now almost completely unusable. Why anybody
thought it would be a good idea to have to scroll up and down the
whole page every few minutes I do not know. Do the people testing this
thing not do anything but write posts? I have to scroll off the screen
to screw with categories or tags, the post box is less wide than it
was before, there's a lot of wasted blank space (not everything needs
20 pixels of margin on all sides, fellas, some of us can see clearly).
What's more, the sidebar space is completely empty and wasted, why not
put some of the items below the fold back up there? Better yet, why
not let ME drag them up there and leave them there? That would be
awesome.

What happened to the drag and drop on the Widgets page? It's one thing
to have an alternative method that is non-javascript friendly, it's
another to get rid of a perfectly easy to understand interface and
replace it with something that should have been rejected on sight. The
drag and drop from the main area to the sidebars area needs to come
back.

I like the new uploader, I don't like the integration with the editor.
Those buttons are barely visible, took me lots of searching to find
it.

Anyway, I forsee a lot of dashboard replacements/plugins coming out if
this is let stand. I mean, this is simply beyond the pale. I don't
mind new looks, but you're supposed to *add* functionality, not remove
it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Uploader to  send to different field
Message-ID: <47B6058B.5060409@pixelplexus.co.za>

Hi

 I'm building a plugin that creates posts (and meta stuff) through a 
customized editing screen that contains a couple of fields in stead of 
the usual content editing field.

 I would like users to be able to use the default uploader to upload 
images etc. as per usual - but want to send the uploaded item's uri to 
one of the custom fields instead. (e.g place  a dropdown  listing 
available fields to send to in the uploader or  something like a upload 
button next to the relevant custom field that uses the normal upload 
behavior/functionality)

 Hoping a kind soul might share some ideas on the best (or even just a 
workable :) way to achieve this in 2.3.x?

 What's the prognosis for doing this with the new uploader?

 Thanx

A

I am trying to make the new uploader code as reusable and
plugin-friendly as possible. Your use case won't be directly supported
by a single function call in 2.5. That might happen in a subsequent
release. You will have to replicate several parts of the system
yourself but I am fairly certain that you will be able to make use of
much of the existing code.

After 2.5 is final I'll be happy to answer your questions more thoroughly.

Cheers,
Andy

I agree with Otto.

I liked the new admin interface, but I think you could use the same WP
2.3write page/post architecture. I wouldn't like scrolling down the
page to
much just to select simple (but important) post options. You're doing a good
job, but I think it can be improved.

Subject: [wp-hackers] New Filter Request: get_tags_to_edit
Message-ID: <84ce626f0802151414v49a93aa9jbeac2b9c48f26790@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'd like to request a new filter.  I want the filter so I can write a
WordPress plugin that will set a default list tags to be
pre-populated, on the write post page, when the user is writing a new
post.


>From what I can tell, the function that sets these tags is...

function get_tags_to_edit( $post_id ) {
        global $wpdb;

        $post_id = (int) $post_id;
        if ( !$post_id )
                return false;

        $tags = wp_get_post_tags($post_id);

        if ( !$tags )
                return false;

        foreach ( $tags as $tag )
                $tag_names[] = $tag->name;
        $tags_to_edit = join( ', ', $tag_names );
        $tags_to_edit = attribute_escape( $tags_to_edit );
        $tags_to_edit = apply_filters( 'tags_to_edit', $tags_to_edit );
        return $tags_to_edit;
}

(This can be found in "wp-admin/includes/taxonomy.php".)

I'd like the hook to be something like...


function get_tags_to_edit( $post_id ) {
        global $wpdb;

        $post_id = (int) $post_id;
        if ( !$post_id )
                return false;

        $tags = wp_get_post_tags($post_id);

        // NEW HOOK HERE
        apply_filters('get_tags_to_edit', $tags);

        if ( !$tags )
                return false;

        foreach ( $tags as $tag )
                $tag_names[] = $tag->name;
        $tags_to_edit = join( ', ', $tag_names );
        $tags_to_edit = attribute_escape( $tags_to_edit );
        $tags_to_edit = apply_filters( 'tags_to_edit', $tags_to_edit );
        return $tags_to_edit;
}


Or something similar.

Thanks.

The hook isn't necessary to do what you want.  You can add a jQuery event
that, when the Write page is loaded, changes the value of either the newtags
or tags_input fields.

I've been reading the post about the demo site over here:
http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/02/14/wordpress-25-demo-site/

It seems to me that a lot of people are complaining about it being...
well.. big. Lots of white space. Lots of scrolling. A few simple CSS
tweaks to remove some of the unnecessary padding and margins would not
be out of order. Would be a good start, at least.

I made a few tweaks myself and there's definitely some room for
improvement there. I'll post something on trac later tonight with my
modifications to the admin CSS files to show what I mean. I need to
tweak it a bit more first.

Great! Lets isolate the problems then, and propose solutions.

Hi Andre,

I have a plugin, tdo mini-forms[1], that allows you to create forms
with any kind of fields you like to make posts. It doesn't currently
support editing of posts (its in my long-term road map) but it does
allow you to upload a file with the post and it has the option to be
added as an attachment and/or as a URI as a custom field. I don't know
how useful it might be to use a reference as it doens't use the
built-in Wordpress uploader (as the intention of my plugin is slightly
different than what I think your intention is).

I like create, and we may switch to it in a later version, but not for 
this one.

As for the other stuff, these ideas are not necessarily good or bad, bet 
they're not backed up by research or usability testing, which the 
current choices are.

Right now all energy is focused on getting the admin up to spec, and 
there is lots of work left to do. After the release of 2.5, it's fine to 
re-examine our assumptions again, and we can do things like look at the 
adoption/downloads of 2.5 vs previous releases to get a sense for which 
of our decisions were correct or not.

We have another release in June. :)

This was caused by the (unnecessary) use of the <a href="..."> in your  
plugin file's "Plugin Name:" header line.  That line should just be  
the plain-text name.  The link is made automatically from the "Plugin  
URI:" header line.

Thanks for finding the bug :)  It should be fixed now.

Note that your own personal blog only checks for updates every 12  
hours or so, but I've installed an old version of your plugin and  
confirmed that an update notification is sent telling me to upgrade.

I think the scrolling thing on the write page might take some getting
used to. If there weren't so many options (like, say, Tumblr or
clones) then it would be fine, but right now it really feels clumsy.
While this opinion might not be backed up by usability tests, I do use
Wordpress a hell of a lot and may find this incredibly frustrating.
Then again, if I think how often I use, say Custom Fields, or even
edit the slug or timestamp, scrolling down isn't going to cause too
many headaches.

At least it should be easily editable, so one can "stick" stuff to the
sidebar if one likes. Rearrangement and personalisation should be the
thing.

Uploader is sexy though and I like the other changes - the settings
are really well placed and the design is lovely and clean. Love the
permalink under the title on the write page with built in edit thing.
It would be best, I think, to have this kind of behavior throughout
the page. For example, on the published bit you could edit the
timestamp etc. This similar "flickr style" editing could be duplicated
in many areas like this across the admin interface.

Thanks for your work on this. Its gonna be a big release!

Regards

Alex

Also, I do think Logout should the last thing on the right on the very
top bar. It feels far more natural, and one of the most easily
accessable points of the screen. When I log off Wordpress, or many
sites, I automatically drift there even without looking sometimes. I
know it normally goes logout - profile, but to have two more options
to thr right of logout seems excessive.

 Help | Forums | Howdy, admin! | Log Out perhaps...

I agree a simple solution would be have over the title of posts or
pages a series aof tabs that switch to the various option available,
so there is no nedd to have them open closed, no need to scroll etc...
but i suppose this would be an option for 2.6... for now this is what
we have.

OK, I've had time to look, and I really don't think I'm going to like the
new write page. In 2.3.x, I can arrange the parts I need in the sidebar. I
can move the sections I use more frequently so they are immediately to the
right of the main elements (title, writing area). This means that I very
rarely need to scroll up and down.

With the layout as it appears in 2.5 so far, it seems I have no control over
this. Some plugins add sections to the posting page - Cricket Moods is one I
use, and I have the pane it adds right at the top of my sidebar, as I use it
for most posts. It now appears at the bottom of the page, and much scrolling
is required to find it. And that's with Firefox at nearly full screen on a
1680x1050 display. 

I use custom fields (not on every post, but generally once a day at least).
More scrolling. 

These are quite significant reductions in usability, which does make me
wonder if the usability testing followed the same methodology that led
Microsoft to produce Office 2007 (otherwise known as "where have all the
features gone?").


I'm not keen on the excess spacing, but that can be fixed with CSS or a
relatively simple theme.

Hi,

I have a plugin here:

Does anyone knows how to edit the page ?

BTW, if you like the plugin, download it from SVN. The release system is

You have to edit the readme.txt file in SVN. The contents of the page
are grabbed from readme.txt.

The readme.txt file has to be in a specific format -- here's one you can

Hi Wordpress

it is so ugly, that a bogger never has his email adresss published.... can
you change this by default, that the mailadress is published as a picture?
How can a blogger be reached by email?

The reason email addresses aren't published is, I think, not only a spam
issue but also a privacy issue. Your best bet is to see if they provided a
website address, otherwise you're probably out of luck - unless you contact
the blog owner and they give it to you...

What is the policy on giving out comment poster's email addresses?
I've never come across any situation like that before.

Well, it's really up to each individual blogger. I always publish my
email address on all my pages, for example. I've never noticed an

It's extremely rare that I find a site which publishes commenter's

Ideally, you'd add a checkbox next to the email field, default it to
unchecked, that says "allow other commenters to contact me via email" or
something along those lines..........

You can sign your comments with your email address if you want to.
Very few people do this. I think new UI elements having that effect
would not useful to most.

Enter the URL of your public identity page if you want to. That is
common and supported.

I'll just come right out and say what everyone is thinking: this
feature would primarily benefit email harvesters.

Heh, yeah, I saw that too. That's got to be the most awesome way to

Message-ID: <47B9FA81.1010806@gmail.com>

Hi,

I've posted about this same subject the other day, but I'm still stuck.

I've messed up with my plugin SVN as yoou can see:
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/comments-statistics/

The structure of the SVN repository is gone. No trunk, tags or branch 
directory. The auto release system doesn't work either, of course.

Does someone know how can I fix this ?
I've already contacted WP, but no answer :(

Any help would be appreciated.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

I'm just guessing here, but couldn't you assume that perhaps, I don't 
know, adding the trunk, tags, and branch directories will correct your 
problem?

You know, what would be even more funny if is you actually contacted 
them and they give you a job. Actually that would be sweet. Easiest job 
hunt ever.

I think also, that is why I never contacted them myself. First, it is 
too easy, HTTP /should/ be common knowledge to you if you are a web 
developer, so they should have hundreds, if not thousands of resumes 
already. Second, I don't like my outlook if that was the only 
qualification. "So basically, I look at headers all day and try to find 
easter eggs?" I said.

I'm sure scoring a position at Automattic is a pretty sweet gig, but I 
think it should be/is a lot more difficult than "find the header."

I don't think so, the structure of the SVN repository is more than that.

Your best bet it to do a full checkout, and then if anything is
"checked" out, use your SVN program to delete it and commit the the
changes. Then recreate the folders, as Jacob suggested. It should
work.

I'm talking from personal experience, I had to recreate my SVN
structure several times when I first started.

Message-ID: <13af0b630802180704v198862d2ra57f8d91a42845c@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to customize a theme here and part of the customization I want to
do is to change the search parameters.

I would like to change it from domain.com/?s=oldtest to something like
domain.com/search?hl=en&q=newtest

so changing s= to q= and adding the search?hl=en to it.

Is that possible using the functions.php page in the theme?  I asked around
in #wordpress, but no one really knew and I didn't see anything on the
forums about it.

thanks!

I think it is possible to do, if you define your own custom rewrite 
rules to convert your form of the URL to result in the same query 
variables that WP uses for its form of the search URL.

Suggested reading:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Query_Overview - to understand how WP 
converts URLs into pages of posts - this will also point you to 
sections of the WP code, in which you can find the default rewrite rules

http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries - has examples of how to use 
rewrite rules and query variables in plugins

(And of course, anything you can do in a plugin can be done in the 
functions.php file of a theme, too.)

"Should" is probably the word there.  I don't think I've met one other
person, face-to-face, that can write HTTP by hand.

Whenever I've told people to use telnet to debug their script or to
verify their script works properly (for things like conditional GETs,
which are sometimes difficult to verify from a browser)...... I've
gotten confused looks.


See ya

I don't know why that hasn't been prioritized but this plugin works great:

I think integrating something like this would be a great idea.

Hi,

I got the SVN working, but the release system doesn't put the newest 
version on the main plugin's page, just in the "Other versions" page.

So, I have 0.1 version in the main page and 0.2.8 (the newest) in the 
"Other versions" page.

Is this the way it is supposed to be ???

Jennifer,

Great, thanks for the suggestion.

Is there anything, maybe in more detail, that anyone else (or yourself
Jennifer), can offer to get this working?  I'm not an experienced
programmer, but I know how to hack my way around with PHP.

Thanks everyone!

I have answered your question twice.
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017680.html
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017803.html

If what I have said is unclear, I would be happy to clarify, but I  
need to know what part to clarify.

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/comments-statistics/
It looks as though you have correctly set up the original repository  
structure, so I'm glad you've gotten that working.

All that's left now is to clean up your plugin file and your readme  
file so that the proper information is displayed on your page at the  
WordPress Plugins Directory: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/comments-statistics/

That page still says your plugin is at "Version: 0.1".  This is  
because your plugin header says your plugin is version 0.1:
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/comments-statistics/trunk/dcs.php

Also, right now your readme file is ignored by the Plugin Directory  
because it is not formatted according to the WP readme.txt standard.

Oops.  Sorry - I didn't see this message and answered this question  
already on your other thread:
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-February/017821.html 
  (the last few paragraphs).

In the future, it would be helpful if you replied to the same thread

Sorry if this has already been discussed before, but I was just looking
through the open tickets and saw this one:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5301

It was suggested in one of the closed duplicate tickets that this issue be
discussed on wp-hackers to find out the general consensus.
I'd personally like to see this go into the core, what do you guys think?

Hasn't this been covered before?

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3708
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4290

Both are wontfix's, and I agree with the reasoning. Knowing if the
username is valid or not is not a security flaw. Security comes from
the system actually being secure, not whether or not somebody can work
out the usernames.

I mean, okay, I understand it in the case of other utilities. Look at
the old SSH documents, and yeah, a username leak makes it that much
easier to run a brute force attack. But this is not SSH. This is a
webpage with a login form. The same solutions should not instantly
apply just because that's what people think of as 'secure'.

What's the potential for harm here? What can somebody do knowing that
the username is wrong or the password is wrong? Brute force attack? If
we want to protect against brute force attacks, hiding the usernames
isn't the right way to do it. The right way there would be to
recognize rapid repeated failures to login from the same IP and block
that IP for a period of time.

I vote for closing #5301 as wontfix *unless* somebody changes the
thing to actually point to a potential exploit and not some
theoretical "you can't know the username" security-theater idea.

I have to say I agree with Otto. Every attacker already knows a username
they can bruteforce with: "admin". Every single Wordpress installation has
the admin user unless someone's gone in and changed the database, so an
attacker doesn't need to use this method to gain a hack-able account.

If we're really worried about the security of usernames and being able to
guess them, then we should do away with a default, unchangable administrator
username, instead of an indication that a username exists.

I agree with both Will and Otto. Security through obscurity is
repeatedly shown to result in laxer passwords and generally more
insecure programs.

>From a user point of view, I use several different emails, or user
names with many different passwords. It can be difficult remember
which exact email/name I used with which password for which website,
and I hate having to try combinations of a username with several
passwords before realizing that I either didn't register with that
username or I didn't register at all.

Even if an attacker knew a person's user name, the amount of time and
tries it would take to brute force it makes it unlikely that it would
pass unnoticed, and if social engineering is used to narrow down the
password choices, something similar can be done to determine the
username.

As I see it, vague error messages have mostly downsides and few, if
any, up sides.

I'm not disagreeing with how these tickets should be closed but you've 
not illustrated why a brute force attack against WordPress is different 
to a brute force attack against SSH and why they shouldn't be afforded 
the same protective measures.

Almost all WordPress installations already disclose usernames because 
the user has instructed it to do so in post metadata or permalinks. 
There's nothing to be done about this. Brute force attacks against SSH 
rarely have such a glut of information readily available and so 
disclosure of valid names is a greater (relative?) risk.

(I'm not sure that blocking IPs is such a great idea - probably left to 
a plugin.)

HTH,

I can repeatedly send password attacks to an SSH server very fast
without it being particularly impacted by it.

Hitting a WordPress server very fast would either a) have a very long
round trip time or b) bring down the server due to the sudden high
amount of database activity.

A webpage is slower than SSH.

Agreed, just pointing out that the solution to a brute force threat is
straightforward. Making error messages less verbose and useful doesn't
solve any real problems.

That's terribly inaccurate.  most fantastico installations will force

My Fantastico setup uses admin as default, with the option to change it 
to whatever you want, within the constraints of the WP user name format.

Just my .02 cents.

Even if you know a user name, WordPress' track record for security is a 
mixed bag anyway- most (all?) of the exploits don't need a user name or 
a password to work.

Hi
In 2.5, the hook 'dbx_post_sidebar' remains in edit-form-advanced.php

Is this on purpose or is it an accidental removal and it will return?

Considering there is no longer dbx or a sidebar, maybe we should
remove it everywhere.

Well, there's not really a sidebar like there is in 2.3, but there is
the submit box.  Some hooks were added that allow pending stuff to it.

I'm missing something here. Are you saying there is going to be no  
opportunity to add to the 'Advanced Options' on a page in the same way  
that can be done with Posts? (currently with the 'dbx' hook which is  
still there).

Hi,

Take a look at Yahoo email registration and see how they protect "user

You can add to the advanced options using the add_meta_box() API.  The
sidebar doesn't have meta boxes though.

I don't know about Fantastico installations, but I know that the default
Wordpress installation doesn't give you a choice. I was only using that as
an example - I just feel that if we were worried about people finding
usernames, then we shouldn't have a default username that you're basically
forced to use (unless you use Fantastico).

Hi dear,

	I need your help, could you tell me a proxy website which is
free for all time, and form where I can download any thing what I want.
Because in my office downloading is restricted and I cannot download any
thing.

If you know some one please tell me.

By the way, I usually make another account the superadmin, and de- 
privilege admin at all, like a subscriber. :-)
Call me paranoid, but it's just a little step to do.

Hello there

Just a couple of thoughts/questions, nothing productive really.

I'm in the process of getting myself used to the new backend look before I 
start updating my plugins, and there's something I don't get in the new UI 
: how various admin links are spread all over the header.
1) link to dashboard in the upper left corner
2) link to your profile in the upper right corner
3) links to plugins / users / settings on the right hand
4) rest of the regular menu on the bottom left.

Maybe I just need some arguments to convince me, but I fail to understand 
how this is supposed to make things simpler. At the moment I just have to 
look around to find the link I need. Mainly, I don't get why the Dashboard 
link is alone over there, and why the "Design" link (presumably something 
you don't use every day) is not grouped with the settings / plugins links. 
If there's a point in segregating some admin links from others, I think a 
"frequent links" group (dashboard, write, manage, comments) and "settings 
links" group (options, theme, plugins) would be more efficient than the 
current 4 places.

I really must concur.  I don't care how many usability studies, etc.,
have been commissioned, there's some serious anti-Fitts' going on in
the new layout.

Having that many targetable mouse-based navigation areas is, simply
put, cluttered.  (See http://katidev.com/blog/?p=20 for some
interesting musings on "Computer Administrative Debris)  I know we're
trying to fit the layout to the most common use scenarios, but there
/has/ to be a better way to implement it.  JS-based hiding/dropdowns
(yes, I know, usability issues galore there too),
cross-platform-friendly keyboard shortcuts, etc.    The "mean mouse
distance necessary to accomplish a task" in 2.5 has gone way, WAY up
when compared to 2.3.  Yay! for simplification.  Booo! for making me
scroll my mouse the whole way to the bottom of the frickin' screen to
send a trackback to those poor souls still using MT or Haloscan.

Another side effect of this link spreading is that when you click on 
"Plugins" on the upper right, you get a plugin-related submenu on the 
lower left. Seems very very odd to me, submenus should be close to their 
parent menus I think.

Great idea, I think I'll do that when I get home!

I've closed the ticket following the discussion here, and the reasons given
in the previous tickets which followed the same theme.

The reason for it being opened was because a correct username could be
"leaked", however this can be achieved in multiple other circumstances, and
the default admin username is known by all (unless they change it as Paolo
mentioned).

Feel free to re-open it, but those are my reasons and we need to close up
the tonnes of open tickets which can be closed

Usability wise, I think it's definitely a step in the right direction,
especially for new users.

A new user just wants to:
 * Write stuff,
 * Manage the stuff they've written,
 * Manage their comments,
 * and Customize their website.

That's exactly what the new menu makes available for them straight from the
outset; it makes the day-to-day tasks more accessible.
They don't need to worry about settings, uses and plugins on a regular
basis, so those links are stowed away at the top.

And I'm not really sure about the dashboard link... Maybe just a space
saving measure; lots of plugins add tabs to the admin menu so it needs to
start off with the least amount of items possible. But it's probably
something else.

*Improvements:*
I would lean towards removing the "Help" and "Forums" links from the header,
we have these in the footer already; makes it look a little cluttered and I
feel quite strongly that the "Log out" should be to the far right. It's
become a habit for me to go straight there to log out of most web
apps/websites - and its a habit I've heard other people have.

I would personally move the "Dashboard" link into the main navigation, but
thats just because I haven't heard the case for its current position.

Dropdowns! Most users would certainly appreciate this, and I know I sure
would.
I want to manage my categories, but I have to first visit the "Manage Posts"
page to get access to the sub-nav. Dropdowns would speed things up a lot.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Making local changes to default filters,

Message-ID: <47BAEC70.3030909@freecharity.org.uk>

I'm looking at pluggable functions such as wp_install() and thinking 
about how I'd replace that function in a fresh install.

Is there a file where I can make changes local to my WordPress 
installation without stepping on core files or using a plugin (which 
wouldn't be active at this stage)? Something like a

wp-includes/local-functions.php

which would be gracefully included, but not present in the core code.

I can vouch that my drop-down admin menu plugin - for all it's faults  
- is far and away the most appreciated and I bet Ozh can say the same  
thing. Having to load two pages to get to where you want to be is like  
returning to DOS before GUI's became available. There may be an army  
of users who need simplicity but I doubt there is one that doesn't  
understand how to use menus and is constantly irritated by the lack of  
them in the WP admin.

Although I would rather see all of the buttons on one line, it does
make sense moving them because in the current admin menu, if you have
two or three plugins that add top-level menus, the menu expands beyond
the edge of the screen rather quickly.

The dashboard link, however, is off in the middle of nowheresville,
and, at the very least, it needs to be made easier to see.

I concur. It is one of two or three plugins that go into every
WordPress install -- and the others are my own.

Good! Great! I'm really happy to hear that you guys have that plugin.
Now would you please take steps to convince Liz and Matt that there is
a better way to arrange the menus than the one that is slated to be
released very very soon?

Excuse my insistence. I dislike the admin structure as much as you do
but I'm working on other aspects of core for 2.5. At this late date,
there isn't anyone to code your ideas. You will have to pick up the
ball and write some code. Please!

And a suggestion: separate the problem of scattered top-level nav from
the problem of multiple page loads. They may be solved with one stroke
of brilliance but it's more realistic to go after them separately.

Also keep in mind that submenus can still be added to Dashboard, an
effect which was not considered by the designers.

I hope I don't read any more bright ideas that will be wasted because
they didn't come with mockups, screenshots, or code.

Cheers,
Andy

Yes - I read it first time around. Having been in the commercial/ 
corporate software industry for 25 odd years working mainly as a UI  
specialist I well know the value of usability testing and it is 100%  
down to what you actually put in front of them to try and use. In my  
experience, the outcome is always flawed and biased towards the lowest  
common denominator. Along with a few others I am deeply puzzled by  
some of the design decisions which are going into the 2.5 admin, many  
of which seem like a backward step. But no matter. As to drop down  
admin menus - so easy to achieve - these appear to have never found  
favour with the WP devs despite the enormous gain in usability that  
they offer and their acceptance in just about every major interface  
you can name. I shall now step out of this thread and go back to  
getting my own plugins 2.5 ready.

Subject: [wp-hackers] New add_meta_box function
Message-ID: <47BB19C0.8000009@poplarware.com>

So, I'm trying to use the new add_meta_box function in a plugin. The 
issue I have is that I want to have a plugin that works for old and 
new WP versions. So I put in this logic:

if( function_exists( 'add_meta_box' )) {
   add_meta_box( something );
  } else {
   add_action('dbx_post_advanced', something );
  }

The problem is that add_meta_box is not defined yet when the plugin is 
loaded. Normally all the hooks in a plugin are added at that time, 
using add_filter and add_action in the main body of the plugin (i.e. 
not within a plugin function), but this doesn't work, because the file 
containing this function hasn't been loaded yet when the plugin is 
first loaded.

Thoughts? Is this a bug I should file in Trac, that 
wp-admin/template.php needs to be included before the plugins are 
loaded, or is this just something the plugin has to work around (e.g. 
put this logic into an init function or something like that)?

Maybe just check for version #?

A bit kludgy, I know, but you do know exactly when the change was  
made....

Actually, this is a really good question in general terms, as making  
this distinction is probably going to help a number of plugins  
seeking backwards-compatibility.

Yes, I know that is possible, and I agree it is very very kludgy; much 
better practice to use function_exists in my opinion.

The reason that I asked was that Ryan et al, who removed the 
dbx_page_advanced action, suggested this method (checking for the 
add_meta_box function's existence), so I was hoping they'd weigh in on 
whether they planned to include the function early enough so that 
would work, or if they had a different suggestion, or if we needed to 
move this one action into the init function, or what. I haven't tested 
in init, by the way, to verify the function is defined then...

Aargh. add_meta_box isn't apparently defined by the time the init 
function is called, either.

I think that's enough to say this is broken... I'll file in Trac.

I played a bit with add_meta_box() to understand how it works and had
the same problem. So instead of hooking things in 'init' or
'plugins_loaded' I hooked them with 'admin_menu' -- at this time, the
function exists.

Good idea. I've noted that on the bug report (Ryan indicates they 
probably don't want to load any more functions at startup), and in the 
Codex migrating page:

Absolutely. I experienced this first hand.

I was trying to convince a friend of mine to switch away from MSN
Spaces, so I got her her own domain name, set it up with WordPress on
my hosting, imported all her posts and such, and gave it to her to
play with. She tried it for a couple weeks, then had me switch it over
to Blogger. Her reason was basically that the number of menu and
Options were too confusing. So I do agree with splitting the main menu
up into two sections like this.

The dropdown idea sounds good though.

I can't agree with this.  I don't think drop downs are a big usability
step forwards, I actually believe often times it's a step backwards.
I am of the opinion that if you need all these levels of drop-downs
then chances are the problem is in your IA.  It's like throwing more
hardware at poorly designed software--eventually it will catch up to
you.

For some reason, my plugin Google Analyticator's WordPress.org listing title
recently changed to Plugin Name. I can't figure out why that would happen as
all my files have the correct name. I also thought the name was controlled
by however added the plugin to the database, so I didn't think I had control

Mike is rolling out new code today, so that WordPress and bbPress
plugin directories will be using the same code. Expect some hiccups.

Interesting enough, it corrected itself. Might have just been a glitch.

You do have control:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/faq/
(second to last question)

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/google-analyticator/trunk/readme.txt  - the  
top line says "Plugin Name".

Don't feel bad, that's a really common mistake :)   So common that  
WordPress Plugins Directory should have caught and corrected it for  
you.  That explains why it corrected itself eventually, but not why it  
ever showed as "Plugin Name" to begin with.

Must be a bug somewhere...

Hi everyone...

I've been murmuring about it for months, and finally have it up to 
"closed Alpha" stage:

http://www.alistercameron.com/2008/02/20/vanilla-theme-alpha-testers-call/

I would love the participation of some of the "better" themers out there :)

I'd be really delighted if anyone could promote this Alpha on their 
blog... the better the testing, the better the theme!

All is explained on my blog.

Thanks :)

I have had a similar experience with menu overload.

I manage a blog, with a half dozen writers, where I customized the
permissions to just the tasks they actually do. I removed permission for the
blogroll because they were not using it and it help simplify the UI. We even
discussed it and they all fully agreed they didn't want to see it.

Ditto on the ZIP issue. All ZIPs of older versions of plugins seem to be
broken.

I agree because I've observed so many users getting confused over drop- 
down menus and not being able to find the link they need.

There was study done on this several years ago at User Interface  
Experts:
http://www.uie.com/articles/users_decide_first/

They found that sites without such things were more effective at  
getting users to where they wanted to go. Here's the gist of it from  
the article:

Is there any way to essentially turn off the blog features of  
WordPress and use it as a pure CMS?

Essentially, Turn off Posts and just have Pages ?

I know you could easily "hide" it by setting the blog page to  
something different -- but how would we make it be "not there".

Thought I'd throw this out to the list, as it seems it would be a  
good feature (or tutorial) for the growing number of people for whom  
WordPress is more CMS than blog app....

A strange server configuration issue affecting only Akismet.  This  
should get fixed the next time the cron jobs roll around.

If everything's working correctly, it should be based on downloads in

Hmm, well i'm a little confused on this one, why not just not use the 
features?

You say you could hide it, and it seems to me that this is in effect a 
very easily implementable idea(assuming that we ignore the ignore 
principle), that I think has two possible routes.

1. The removal of the post write/management screens. This would be an 
option, like the removal of the visual editor. However, this would 
involve point two.

2. The use of theme templates to not use all the post listing functions. 
This then requires specific themes designed for the purpose.

For a site i run that is cms, i still use posts to make announcements, 
so there are different needs in a cms. just my opinions.

I agree with Alex. I use WP as a CMS a lot and always have a need for
content that is outside the normal page hierarchy (news items, products,
etc).

2. The use of theme templates to not use all the post listing functions. 
This then requires specific themes designed for the purpose.

For a site i run that is cms, i still use posts to make announcements, 
so there are different needs in a cms. just my opinions.

Just curious, but, wasn't this new and improved design already done up 
before basically? I mean, if there's a design mock-up already there.. 
why so many constant changes when implementing it in Trunk? Just put in 
the original design and be done. Box it, wrap it, and ship it.

I'd venture it's not by taking away features/functionality from it that
WordPress that it becomes a CMS. The existing data architecture of posts,
the taxonomy system, everything involved their listing, the fundamental
user experience both in terms of admin and audience is incredibly useful
in a CMS context.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/astickypostorderer/

(for what it's worth I've been exploring this with aStickyPostOrderer (my
first plugin :-)) that allows you to arrange posts in non trivial orders,
e.g make the most recent 3 posts with the tag 'events' sticky in any
listing of posts that contain it, or in this category when someone is
looking at the site show my very first post to this category that
introduces this category first, or move all posts with a given tag to the
end of the listings . Then everything else in the usual reverse
chronological order - blogging conventions aside, and given RSS and
agregators I'd guess most visitors to most front-ends of blogs are first
time visitors.)


(I'm also currently working on a plugin that uses the existing posts to
display a directory systems, easily manageable data types, specific search
prarams etc. all eventually exported to posts.

I do this exact thing at: http://tinyurl.com/2dtqrq [1]

No need. You just don't use the features. If you go to the above URL,
you will find absolutely _no_ evidence that the site uses a blogging
engine, apart from the WordPress generator tag.

Well, you could always hack the global $menu and remove the Write Post
and Manage Posts pages from the admin. Of course, it's a little more
complicated than that, but it could be done.

Unless, of course, you're intending to strip the blogging functionality
out of WordPress entirely. Eek. I wouldn't attempt that if you paid me.

Because the "original design" is most likely a bunch of Photoshop source
files, or prototype HTML mockups.

With regards to all the tweaking going on: sometimes, things that seemed
okay a week ago make absolutely no sense at all today. There's always
room for improvement.

Totally understandable. I had to code a WP theme based on that 
(Photoshop source files) before too. It SUCKED. Thank God it was a paid 
job though. LOL! fyi; I was just being a sarcastic prick, lack of sleep 
and personal problems gets me miserable and spiteful. I'll spank myself 
for it.. no, not that way either...

Matt, there is a difference between open source and open development.
What would have been achieved if the mockups had been shown to the
community before the implementation began?

Just in relation to this quote:

"Well, you could always hack the global $menu and remove the Write Post
and Manage Posts pages from the admin. Of course, it's a little more
complicated than that, but it could be done.

Unless, of course, you're intending to strip the blogging functionality
out of WordPress entirely. Eek. I wouldn't attempt that if you paid me."

A quick search brings up over 100 references to post-new.php and edit.php, so this would be a mammoth task!

Another way top look at this would perhaps be a user level issue, so remove the post write/edit capabilities, but in that case why not just ignore, unless we want to prevent people from accidentally making posts. Still though, themes would have to be adapted.

Certainly a lot less questions on the mailing list about where the design
was going, and I just don't see any reason for the mockups not to be shown.
Just keeping them secret for the sake of it, it seems.

My 2 cents (and options would be)
1. Post or Page, remember which you used last when clicking in Write or
Manage.
2. or have an option in settings to use post or page as default.

...just change the word 'Post' to 'News Items' in the admin interface,
and bang, it's a $50,000 CMS. :)

I agree with everyone else, if you don't want to use the 'blogging'  
features then just don't user them. Meaning your site does not need to  
look like a blog site. I mostly create non-blog sites for clients and  
have done so for the last 2 years using WordPress. These sites are  
generally build out using Pages in some hierarchy. But don't sell the  
'blogging' aspect of WordPress short. Even on these non-traditional  
site the client still has the need to post news, press items or  
events. This is handled perfectly by the chronological Post side of  
the WordPress engine.

Here are some example:

http://acbushnell.com
http://thrillsfromthegrill.com/
http://davidshanks.com/
http://www.eia-usa.org
http://www.intelligentfirstaid.com/
http://www.southernstudio.com/


As for actually hiding the blogging menu items in the WordPress admin  
area I think there are a handful of plugins that will actually allow  
you to disable. One for example is clutter-free  http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/clutter-free/ 
. Another is the roles plugin that can be used.

Ironically, a followup to such language is "Pardon my French". ;)

Perhaps I phrased it wrongly.  WordPress is a heavily blog-oriented  
CMS.  The question (which has been largely answered) is:

Can we remove the blog aspects of the admin and make it a purely page- 
based CMS?

Yes, you can use the WordPress API and build pages at the root which
either pull from the posts table as page type in the WordPress
installation.

If you mean CMS in the sense that you can add news area, forum area,
comments area, etc easily by dropping a plugin, I would say you need to
use an application built specifically for that purpose which has those
features.

In the basic sense, WordPress makes it extremely difficult, but not
impossible, to enhance the base feature set. You can't really (that I know
of and I don't know much about the query and theme workflow systems) add
new theme conditions to pull in specific pages (without using page
templates). You can't extend the query system (again, I've looked at it
and much of it does not look like it is extensible.

You can get around this by using techniques, some intelligent people have
posted to the mailing list, but I doubt it is common knowledge and without
their permission, it is unlikely to be added to the codex (it would be
very useful, if those people would add or if they have already, posted a
link) that gives instructions on setting up redirects to custom pages.

You can add custom tags by using a plugin and modifying themes to use
them. You can also customize the navigation by using Widgets.

I will say, that you have to choose the best application for task, you
/could/ make WordPress into a task tracker, like Trac or Bugzilla, but I
would just as well advise using either Trac, Bugzilla, etc because of the
amount of development hours that has already been invested in making those
applications the best they can be.

Now, if you wanted something simple, like a mini or medium sized site,
then yeah, WordPress could be your CMS, however, if you want something
more powerful, then you'll probably want to use something built
specifically for CMS.

The answer is yes. You can do whatever you want, however you want it,
depending on how much work you are willing to put into achieving it.

Just change the permission of the menu link and the permission to the post
page. You can also decide to change the homepage page and the posts page
to something different. You can also add administration pages.

You can replace the administration by having the page in the plugins.
There is a bug report, but all indications says that the behavior is
intentional.

You and I know that, but bosses don't know it. Because WP has focused  
on being the best blogging platform, and because that's 99% of its  
usage, it can take quite a bit of selling and example showing to  
convince bosses and clients that it's up the task for their site. I  
personally think there's still a lot of work to do to get that message  
out, to convince people that they don't necessarily need Drupal or  
whatever. I'd love to see a Codex page listing WP sites that look  
nothing like blogs. And I'd love to see a line on the homepage of  
wordpress.org  and linking to that page.

Just calling it a "semantic publishing platform" on the homepage isn't  
enough - it should  be made explicit on the homepage that WP is a  
great CMS for many types of sites. If we don't  use the actual words  
"content management system" on the homepage, it's no wonder suits  
aren't getting the message.

I think this thread is getting a little off topic from the original  
question. But I just want to add that I've worked in Documentum,  
Sharepoint, Drupal, EzPublish, Vinette, RedDot (shudder). Creating  
small and very large-scale multi-departmental sites using these tools.  
And you know what they all suck mainly because the decision to use the  
tool was decided long before the requirements for the project were  
discussed. In my experience clients have a lofty idea what they think  
a CMS should be. In simple terms a CMS should allow the client with  
very little technical abilities to maintain content. Some of the  
larger system add various 'features' that are so complicated many tech  
folks scratch their head when attempting to simply put a calendar on a  
page.

I like WordPress and use it to make my living by enabling my clients  
to maintain their own content without the need to ping me or worse  
have me charge them for entering content. Sure WordPress lacks some  
features like content versioning. A really robust workflow system like  
Drupal. But most of my clients are less than 3 people who enter  
content. They don't need to complicated system because they decide  
outside the WordPress system what is ready to be published.

Just my comments.

Hey all -

I worked as part of Happy Cog with Automattic on the user research  
and IA for the new admin, so I wanted to put some of the rationale  
out there:

Not an explanation per se, but here was our process:

To start to understand how people were using the navigation, and more  
importantly, how people needed to use it, we looked at two things:

* Task analysis: we watched, in person, how people across different  
segments used the admin to perform basic tasks
* Site analytics: we looked at the data to evaluate the most visited  
screens and paths to screens

(Both of the above were informal, rather than rigorous measures, and  
this kind of testing of the admin will be ongoing.)

Based on the above, we found that most users primarily do four basic  
things:
* Write new posts
* Manage existing posts/pages
* Manage comments
* Tweak the layout

We also found that people tend to think of the comments area as a  
kind of inbox?almost like email. So we wanted to treat that a bit  
different (e.g., placement on the right with a count of open comments).

The IA work recommended that the utility navigation be moved away  
from the primary navigation. This was in part because:

* The content under these links perform separate kinds of tasks  
(plugins being sort of a mixed bag)
* The primary navigation has room to grow as additional plugins often  
add to the primary navigation
* It provided a clearer toolset for the most common activities  
(write, manage posts, pages and comments, and tweak the design)

True enough. This is something that Happy Cog is working out before  
the release of 2.5. There is a bit of a disconnect between the  
utility nav and its submenus. Like all things, this is an iteration,  
so we continue to improve and evolve it as we go. This is just one of  
the things that will continue to change and improve.

What are the "blog aspects" of the admin?

Posts are simply an ordered method of content organization. While they
are usually ordered by time, they can be ordered by any arbitrary
means (this is up to the theme).

Pages are an unordered method of content organization, with an
optional hierarchical organization scheme.

The admittedly badly-named "Blogroll" is an external-site link
organization system.

In point of fact, there's nothing particularly visible in WordPress
that is primarily geared towards "blogging". Okay, there's a few
settings in the Options menus that are mainly geared toward the
blogging crowd, but for the most part, it's really a matter of the
theme. The theme is what makes the site a "blog" or not. I mean, you
can display your posts in a reverse time-ordering method and that's
pretty bloggish, but for the most part, the system itself doesn't
necessarily require that scheme.

The main reason to not ditch posts is simple: feeds. You cannot put
static page content into a feed in a sensible way.

New users certainly do want to tweak the layout, but I'd like to  
think that users of a blog that's been running smoothly for some time  
are writing posts more often than they are changing elements of the  
theme.

There's a block of text that appears near the top of the dashboard of  
"Things To Do" with the new blog. These are important guidance for  
new users, but the needs of seasoned people is different. For  
example, a new user may want to Write a Post, Change their Password,  
or Modify their Theme. However, after things are running, theme  
modification is far less important than comment moderation and post/ 
draft management.

Yet, "You are using Hemingway theme with 5 widgets. [Change Theme]"  
is still front and center. Maybe the text driving users to the Design  
or Theme section should be time-sensitive, and display prominently on  
the Dashboard as part of a checklist, which is removed once users  
have figured out how / decided to change the theme away from defaults  
to their preference.

(As a side point, I cannot figure out how to upload images using  
Safari 2 in the new admin interface in trunk head, even when  
disabling the visual editor. The visual editor and the Add Media  
buttons appear to work in Safari 3.0.4. Anyone seen/documented this?  
Not found anything in Trac yet.)

I disagree.

Sharing the mock ups with everyone wouldn't have achieved much except
causing a large mailing list thread containing the many different
questions/issues people had about the new design.

Getting a working system in front of people is much more important.

The best feedback on the new admin design from the community can only be
given once it is implemented - so that you can see how it works.

Simple Solution: 
Ship WP with a second, stock, very similar _theme_ that looks and feels like
a CMS :)

Not that I want to re-ignite an old  debate, but when we had the  
discussion on this list about whether to call it Blogroll or Links in  
the admin, the majority of list members said "Links". My informal poll  
showed 89% preferred Links  over  Blogroll.

http://birdhouse.org/blog/2007/06/26/links-or-bookmarks/

But when 2.3 came out, it was still Blogroll. No one ever said OSS  
development was a democracy, but it was kind of disappointing to see  
such a clear majority opinion being totally ignored.

That's a great start, and I'll  add to it. The page needs fleshing   
out and explanation. But  the key point is in how  WP  is represented  
to the public - to raise awareness that it's not *just* a blogging  
platform, and to help potential adopters figure out whether WP is  
appropriate for the type of site they're building.

Hey,

after the recent changes to the plugin stuff on wordpress.org, I'm not  
able to link to a plugin without it's version number anymore... Where  
I was able to link to:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/sociable.zip

I now have to link to:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/sociable.2.5.2.zip

Which sucks cause it means I have to update my download links for each  
new release...

Could someone please give me back the old way of linking? :)

Cheers,
Joost

That's a bug.  I'll look into it.

I don't know why this happened.  I couldn't reproduce the bug and have  
verified that the file is there and is being served.

Maybe you caught the file right when it was being updated?

Fixed

example:

http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/twitter-tools.1.1b1.zip
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/twitter-tools.1.1b1.zip

Both work (the later redirects to the former)

I disagree. Letting the community give feedback on the mockups can help
shape designs to be even better. Considering most of us our developers on
this list, we can imagine how a design will work while it's still just a
mockup. Plus, the community could have helped implement it.

It's a little moot at this point, I would say the current state of the 
admin incorporates all or more of the mockups and intentions.

This is probably meant to be taken as feedback that folks would like considered next time.

Although I think of myself as a great UI designer, not once have I invited the opinions of others and not learned something.

Having community viewing mock-ups isn't really a bad thing, however like 
someone else said, it leaves the door wide open for constant arguing and 
wanting this changed, or that changed. You'd spend more time arguing and 
disagreeing than actually implementing the intended design.

That's where, if posting mock-ups on a blog post, and then turning off 
comments comes in handy. ;) :D Or, post the "future to be" mock-ups 
before actual implementation time frame, get user feedback and such, but 
just have it controlled. Like you basically do with the 
(http://wordpress.org/support/forum/4 and 
http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/ ) part of WordPress.org.

And if the discussion(s) start up on a email list, have the list 
moderator moderate the emails regarding it. Arguments and disagreeing 
isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is when it gets out of hand. 
That's where it needs moderated by the powers that be.

It also shapes, improves, changes WordPress gradually to be a better 
blogging software as time rolls on, AS a Community effort. Same goes for 
the design and what you want WordPress to portray with that design. 
Having a base / original design mock-up is the starting point. Having it 
publicly viewable in very beginning is good, just have the feedback on 
it moderated and controlled. Take votes in reasonable manner, not 
bitching and moaning. Present change(s) and ideas again with new set of 
mock-ups.

Remember though, all of this having a LIMITED amount of change 
suggestions set from the get go. So you're not going from what you have 
now (design wise) and by the time it's implementation time, it's not 
looking like (for example) Shuttle. (Even though that'd be f-ing sweet!) 
Just saying, that's drastic changes that shouldn't be, shouldn't happen.

Simple, decent changes with usability into consideration, suggestions 
and opinions aren't bad. Just needs moderated and kept on reasonable 
level of "change requests". I dunno though, I need sleep and for once 
I'm not sarcastic and being mean... (No, I'm not sick either.) So yeah, 
this is a nice and decent email from me and how I feel about this 
discussion and all. :) I'm heading to bed... night folks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Lack of focus rectangles on links in the WP admin
Message-ID: <1203730912.6740.10.camel@rillian.sunriseroad.net>

I'm concerned about the fact that when a link in the new WP admin is
focused (e.g. selected by the Tab key), it has no selection rectangle
around it.

If I were trying to navigate around my WP admin with my keyboard (I was
using a computer with a mouse that was not working on Friday, so I
wouldn't have been able to use WordPress if I wanted to then), I
wouldn't have been able to, because I wouldn't have been able to see
which link I had focused with the Tab key.

I agree that the rectangles are ugly, but accessibility > appearance.
Please remove the "outline: none;" code from the CSS.

What I did for the Install4Free style was not removing the dotted
outline rectangles, but making them a prettier solid grey instead.
<http://install4free.wordpress.net/>

We could possibly have a red outline (same colour as the link hover
colour) when focused instead of the ugly dotted rectangle.

The ugly dotted rectangle is universally recognised as the current
focus point and shouldn't be changed or removed.

Er, therefore I agree with you Jeremy that it should be restored to
the default. No need to change it to anything else other than the
default.

Hi everyone,

I created a small style guide on how to make your plugin settings  
pages look good in WP 2.5, because I see quite a bit of plugins need  
some work ;)

It's here: http://www.joostdevalk.nl/wordpress-25-plugin-settings-pages-style-guide/

If you have anything to add feel free to email me or comment!

I think it's like that to avoid expansion of the menu when clicking. 
When you click it, you can notice the outline makes the width of the 
menu larger.

AFAIK the CSS outline property doesn't affect the width of an element.

I think it may count as a border, which affects the width of the UL.

That property doesn't effect the width of anything, as far as I can tell the
reason it was removed was purely for decorative purposes.

I just got the latest trunk version and manually removed the "outline:
none;" code; nothing bad happens, (using FF on Windows), it just doesn't
look as pretty when you select tabs in the main navigation.

So we have to weigh up: accessibility vs appearance.

Personally, my vote goes to accessibility.

By that I meant nothing moves or expands, you just get a dotted border.

Message-ID: <47C1056D.4020504@gmail.com>

Again, on the Media Library page, I'm STILL getting a huge scroll bar 
effect.
http://www.vindictivebastard.net/images/mediascroll-2.png

Thought maybe, if things were "bundled" in a preset width section, it 
wouldn't be pushing things over to the right hand side, resulting into a 
huge scroll bar effect. This is on my 800x600 res screen. This also 
happens when viewing the Support Forums sometimes when people use 
extremely looong titles for threads. Borks the front page of Support 
Forums.

Spencer: damn it
http://www.vindictivebastard.net/images/mediascroll-2.png

Jeremy: ah, I see what you mean

Spencer: they do it on the MANAGE page... when viewing posts

Jeremy: maybe you want:
table.somethingorother {
max-width: 100%;
}
oh wait
I know why it's wrapping
I mean not wrapping
because it's a URL with no spaces

Spencer: ahhh yes

Jeremy: look at how you edited the image
when you typed in that text, you manually put those line breaks in the 
middle of the URL
the web browser doesn't know how to do that

Spencer: ahh

Jeremy: so it just makes the table really long
so you want overflow: hidden, possibly

I didn't want to do anything "patch wise" because I wasn't sure what 
Andy or anyone else was doing with it yet. But just wanted to point it 
out...

Message-ID: <47C11502.5020700@gmail.com>

On the MANAGE > TAGS page there, it's showing like 50 pages worth of 
Tags right? But, no names are showing for tags until like the 5th page. 
On the first 4 pages worth of tags, it's blank by the checkbox there. 
However, there is a few of them that are evidently assigned to post. 
Cause it's showing "1"  under the POSTS column, just has NO NAMES for 
these tags to the far left side by checkbox. Are these duplicate tags 
maybe? Or, is this a glitch via the database and perhaps those ones can 
be deleted? Thanks in advance.

I dont see any empty tags in my list, I'd say its probably something to do with a faulty migration/import of tags at one stage.

If its empty, i'd delete them, but if your really worried, backup your database first.

They should be able to be deleted. WordPress had (has?) a glitch where
it would add empty tags to posts. I used the Simple Tags plugin to get
rid of them, and stop it from happening.

I'm not sure if it was fixed it or not, as I still have the plugin activated.

My understanding is that is the plan, once they are ~complete.

Web and Application User Interfaces is one of the things that I'm just 
plain terrible at. I think that the content would be great at the Codex, 
since it would be useful for hackers and plugin developers. However, 
"User Interface" should probably be used, instead of "interface" because 
without context, there are many things "interface" can mean.

Agreed...
Here I was thinking that there was a new subsystem for interfacing
with WordPress installs remotely :-)

Thanks guys! Those tags were probably created / imported BEFORE those 
"fixes" were applied. I remember a while back I was using UTW plugin for 
my tags, then things went whacky once WP started it's own tagging for 
core. Well, it went whacky when I was doing importing/ conversioning of 
UTW tags to WP tags that is. I'll do a backup of the database and then 
try removing them all once. Thanks again! :)

Yes, that's definitely the plan once it's a bit more final. I've been  
chipping away at the guidelines over the past handful of weeks.  
They'll never be _complete_, so I just have to get them to a good  
stage before moving over to the Codex.

Great point. It should be clear this is about the user interface, not  
the more general "interface."

Just wondering, I just did a SVN UP to include this commit as latest of 
course. When is the Approve button actually supposed to be hidden? I 
just went to the "edit comments" section via COMMENTS > Awaiting 
Moderation (0) under MANAGE COMMENTS H2 there.

Now, don't confuse things here... I didn't click the big link above 
titled "Awaiting Moderation". I clicked the little link "Awaiting 
Moderation (0)" under the landing page for Comments section  (Awaiting 
Moderation (0) |  Approved |  All Comments).
yourdomain.com/wp-admin/edit-comments.php?comment_status=moderated

The Approve button is still there, along with "Mark as Spam" and 
"Delete" But there's no comments listed there, as it says "No results 
found." Shouldn't those buttons be hidden then as well, if there's no 
comments there period, or ?

Another thing is, where did the "Unapprove" button go when on the 
Comments landing page? Usually you could just put a checkmark in the 
checkbox for a comment, then just hit "Unapprove" button. I see the big 
blue buttons "Approve" / "Mark as Spam" / "Delete". But no way to 
"Unapprove" anything on the fly. Now, I also see the little links on the 
comments themselves called "edit/delete" under the Actions column. But 
nothing for "Unapprove".

I'm going to miss that, because before it was hella faster to 
"Unapprove" a comment on the fly when on the Comments landing section, 
now we'd have to edit the comment first before having that action 
applied. Or is the "Unapproved" totally removed and referred to as, or 
just handled with the "Moderate" or "Mark as Spam" functions? Just was 
wondering.

Quick question on the menu topic:

It's currently:
[Write Page | Write Post]

I'm willing to bet my life savings that the majority of WP users are
more likely to want to create a post than a page - shouldn't those two
be switched around? Stupid little thing to nitpick, I know, but anyway
- the "standard" in UIs for the past decade or so has been to have the
more likely/default/positive option of any two on the left-hand side
(at least in LTR languages).

For instance:
"Do you want to continue?"
[Yes|No]

"What would you like to do:"
[Make a million dollars|Leave]

etc. etc.

Yeah........

Woah wait, where are you seeing this at CG? When I go to WRITE page, it 
has Post there first, then Pages then Link. Or are you talking about 
another version of WordPress or something? Not related to this 
discussion, but, why is there now a small scroll effect on the WRITE 
POST page? Are people getting a little nutty about widths/ percentages 
and sizes? :P Please keep in mind, there are people still using crappy 
800x600 res screens because their eyes can't handle anything above that 
res... hmmk thx. :P

In the past we used the GNOME style, which puts the primary button
right-most. I think Liz's interface guide has the primary left-most,
however.

Primary button right-most is also the Apple standard as well, I
believe. Closing windows are usually like this.

[Cancel] [Close]

When I have to use something besides GNOME or Mac OS, I have to
actually read the buttons. :-)

Do all these things follow certain unwritten, unspoken, unreferenced
cult knowledge or are they actually documented somewhere?

I'm using GNOME here right now (Fedora 8 ATM), and only just noticed
that it's right-most for the primary..... must've subconciously noted
the difference because it didn't hit me until now even though I use
Windows more often (is it the only one to do left for the primary?)

I just looked at that now. IMHO, it should be PAGE first then POST. 
Reason being is, when the user installs 2.5 for first time, they'd want 
to most likely write a PAGE first. Like, an About page, Contact page, 
etc etc. Then get into writing Posts. But, who knows though. Everyone is 
different.

Could we have a check to see if they have created some page then we put the
POST link on the left? Just a thought...

But I think for everyday use, POST on the left would seem more logical, and
more natural for me to jump to anyway.

*Cough* Then make a patch quick, attach to ticket, and take vote on 
whether to commit it or whatever. But, it might be another one of those 
tickets that linger for months or decades though... might actually get 
committed around version 5.XX

We need to make a HIG decision first.  Right now all of our dialogs
have the primary right-most.  We need to decide if we want to change
that and if dialog button order rules should be the same as button
order rules in other places.  Bulk operation buttons, for example, try
to put the most used left-most, nearest the checkboxes.

Oh okay. Well, I went and made a DIFF quick. Just switched the positions 
of those links and etc. I didn't make a ticket or anything though, just 
have the DIFF here and ready for switching the two around.

I personally could care less, really. But your average user is, let's
face it, going to be brought-up in a Windows-centric world... so
they'll be used to left-most for primary when it comes to buttons.

Just thought I'd put a voice to that thought - don't shoot the messenger! :-D

Dynamically changing the position of those links strikes me as a very bad
idea from a usability perspective, since it plays games with user
expectations: people don't anticipate menu items jumping around depending on
what they've written.

Adding to this, I'm seeing the "Approve" link along with the "edit and 
delete" under the Actions column on Comments waiting for approval on the 
Comments (edit comments) landing page in the wp-admin/ But clicking the 
Approve link, it doesn't do anything. I had to click on the little 
"Awaiting Moderation (1)" link, then approve it there. I had to put 
checkmark in the box, then hit "Approve".

I was thinking that when I wrote it :P
I take it back!

But I feel that left-most for primary when it comes to buttons etc. will be
more natural for the majority of users. As was mentioned earlier, the
majority of users will be used to Windows.

Also, most web apps I have used tend to do the same.

The user interface guidelines, at least at this point, have the  
primary buttons left-aligned under the fields they refer to so users  
have the clearest path to their primary action. This is chiefly based  
on the extensive user research that Luke W's done on button alignment  
with field labels.

And so: http://bobulate.com/wpig/wiki/index.php?title=Buttons

(But this doesn't answer the question about the Dashboard?a different  
case altogether. This just for reference...)

Lmao! Now that I'm able to drink legally again, perhaps I should have a

I hear you, I've been writing about developer manual topics in hopes to 
eventually have enough content to add and revise the codex and create a 
docbook. It is less boring doing it step by step, so good luck with 
that. It will be helpful now and eventually when it is added to the 
codex where a broader audience will have access to it. I do advise that 
you put more than one link to the user interface section and in a well 
traffic area, because I remember finding a section on the Codex that I 
never thought was added only to lose it again since it wasn't linked 
well enough.

Hey Liz,

I just read the Luke W article, it's very enlightening - that's
exactly what I was looking for above.... and here I was thinking it
was taking me an extra eye-flicker because I just wasn't used to it
;-)
....or maybe it's that most of the people Luke tested are trained on
Windows, and therefore used to left-oriented buttons which is the
decision MS made a long time ago (i'm sure they researched it well
first, though) - wouldn't that be something?

In the end, I guess it doesn't matter if it was the Chicken or the Egg
that came first, bottom line is, we're not having beans for dinner.

Cheers,

Bah, hate to double-post, but whatever:
Would be really nice is if we could see the heat-maps for the other
designs as well, primarily how the user focus would shift when
provided with a reversed button layout.

But I think it's all moot because the new WP admin interface is very,
errr, *different* layout than most of the forms out there. For one
thing, the buttons I'm referring to are *already* on the
right-hand-side so the whole heat-map is rendered useless before its
even had a chance.....

/me wonders about having heatmap/eye-tracking experts take a look at
the WP admin center once it's finished and just give us their
suggestions on the order and relative placement of things; the design
aspects aside. After all, WP is now one of the biggest projects
anywhere - if we don't take advantage of this kind of stuff then who
would? <G>

In general patches only really save time when it's not something

time to do the change as download/apply a patch.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp-comments-post.php & file upload problem
Message-ID: <47C2FFF7.6050202@bellsouth.net>

Hi,

Y'all are my last hope of figuring this problem out.

I have a blog (linked at the eom) on 2.3.3, and everything is fine with 
it.  I got an add-on domain the other day and after a lot of 
hair-pulling, I finally got WP installed on the same server account as 
my regular blog (related wp forum thread here 
<http://wordpress.org/support/topic/158528?replies=3>).  Yay, right?  
Eh, not quite. 

The add-on domain/blog URL is http://mccainblogs.com/ (don't heckle me 
pls) and the location is /public_html/mccainblogs.com/(wordpress files); 
in the options the wordpress address is set as 
http://bamapachyderm.com/mccainblogs.com.  (That's just background 
information, I guess.)
*
My problem*:  I can't comment on mccainblogs.com; I get the dreaded 
blank screen stuck on wp-comments-post.php, no redirect to the original 
post, and no comment gets posted.  I've seen this issue in the WP forums 
and elsewhere around the internets, but I can't find a solution that 
applies even closely enough to help me figure it out.  I'm not hosted on 
Yahoo or IIS or any of those places, I'm hosted at Blogs-About (with 
Lisa Sabin).  I *have* turned off all plugins and tried the default 
theme, and the same thing happens with comments.  When I tried 
commenting using IE, I saw that it's giving a 405 error. (!)

*The other problem:*  I also can't upload anything (images) from the 
admin (post) panel.  It does nothing when I do it, and whatever I try to 
upload shows up nowhere on the server.  I can work around that with ftp, 
but obviously I'd rather not.

I'm SURE this is all because of the add-on domain, because everything 
works fine on my regular blog and my "testing" blog 
(bamapachyderm.com/testing/ - nothing special with that one).  I just 
don't know what I'm missing!  My .htaccess file is very close to the one 
on my regular blog (with obvious changes, like instead of 
bamapachyderm.com I have mccainblogs.com where needed).  Is it possible 
my .htaccess file should NOT say mccainblogs.com, but should instead 
refer to the wordpress location address? 
(bamapachyderm.com/mccainblogs.com/)  I do NOT want to have 
bamapachyderm show up in the mccainblogs.com URL to visitors, but I 
don't care what it looks like to me, if that matters.

My assumption is that there's something I need to change in the 
.htaccess file, but I don't know what that change would be. I even 
thought maybe it had something to do with the canonical url, but this is 
a new blog and I haven't set up any kind of redirects (/www/no www/ or 
whatever) for it, and I'd think if that were the problem, I'd have it on 
my regular blog as well, which I don't.

What am I missing, besides sleep?

Thanks!

Most definitely. It is *completely* dependent on people volunteering
to mentor though -- and hopefully less strong arming from me this year
;-)

If you are interesting in volunteering as a mentor please share with
us in this thread your interest and for now just the broad area of
expertise / interest for mentoring.


Thank you,

Why are you setting the WordPress address to
http://bamapachyderm.com/mccainblogs.com/ ? Try setting it to just
http://mccainblogs.com/ .

The only reason that the Blog Address and the WordPress address need
to ever be different is when the wordpress root and the actual
wp-includes and such are in different locations. If WordPress is
installed wholly in one directory, then both of those should be the
same.

Okay, I did that.  I got booted out of the admin panel when I did it, 
and when I went to try to post a comment, the same thing happened 
(wp-comments-post.php issue).

That DID fix the upload issue, though.

(Getting booted out of the admin panel was no problem; I just logged 
back in.)

Thanks, Otto--it's working now.  The theme I was using had the popup 
comments script enabled, and that was at least a minor part of the 
problem.  Fixing the Wordpress address did the trick!  :)

I would rather be a student, since I'm in school and I don't have too 
much experience with WordPress. Of course, I do know about 20-30% of the 
code base and can easily read code to determine the purpose and follow 
the path and figure the outcome.

Dude, totally could rewrite major portions of the code base to use 
DOMXML and DOM since the requirements have increased to 4.3. You could 
use that as one of the projects. You would need a wrapper to be 
compatible with both DOMXML and DOM, since DOMXML is PHP 4.3.x to PHP 
4.4.x and DOM is PHP 5+ only. If you don't realize by now, you can't use 
both at the same time, or you can only use one or the other. Therefore 
you will have to create something that uses either DOMXML or DOM 
depending on the PHP version.

The advantages of this, would be quicker parsing of XML and 
(well-formed) XHTML. Less bug prone WordPress to WordPress 
Exporter/Importer not dependent on strict formatting standards and 
generally just less bug prone. Would also be totally sweet.

Like Jacob, I'm looking to be a student again this year, but hopefully we
can get some great mentors for 2008. I'm really hoping some excellent ideas
can be be formulated this year as well. I'd love to tackle a fairly large
project that would benefit the majority of WordPress users, whatever that
may be.

I don't know if this is the same thing I found on my blog (wp-2.3.3)
but I found, occasionally, people would try to submit a comment and
would get a blank screen. Tracked it down to the comment form in my
theme. In my "comments.php", I had, right down the bottom of the form
this line:

<input type="hidden" name="comment_post_ID" value="<?php echo $id; ?>" />

For some reason "$id" would be empty sometimes, particularly for
non-logged in users. I replaced it with this:

<input type="hidden" name="comment_post_ID" value="<?php echo $post->ID; ?>" />

And the problem seemed to go away.

Sounds like an old, poorly coded them.

Make sure to check the /default/ theme for the latest standards and
practices.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Overwrite bloginfo() function
Message-ID: <c41cda880802260427l6c5e2ffexafea9c0153cd0c08@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm considering to write a plugin to modify (or overwrite) the default
bloginfo() function without patching system files.

I would write a plugin that "overwrites" the bloginfo function if the
parameter is = 'template_directory" or "wpurl". Since these are values
that they often don't change on production sites, I thought that's is
less explensive for the database to write directly the url or
template_dir values without select them from the DB. This could be
useful on high traffic sites...

Eg. something this

<?php
/*
Plugin Name: ...
[....]
Description: .......
*/

define('SITE_URL', 'http://www.mysite.com');
define('TEMPL_DIR', 'http://www.mysite.com/wp-content/themes/default');

function bloginfo($show=''){
if ($show='wpurl') {
echo SITE_URL;
} elseif ($show='template_directory') {
echo TEMPL_DIR;
} else {
// do the original stuff
}
}

?>

I saw there's a function here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_action

can this be useful for me? Or there's no way to do that i want to do?

thanks in advance,
Claudio

When you want to modify a core function behavior, use the plugin API. For 
instance, the following is roughly what you need:

add_filter('bloginfo', 'mybloginfo', 1, 2);
add_filter('bloginfo_url', 'mybloginfo', 1, 2);

function mybloginfo($result='', $show='') {
        switch ($show) {
        case 'wpurl':
                $result = SITE_URL;
                break;
        case 'template_directory':
                $result = TEMPL_DIR;
                break;
        default: 
        }
        return $result;
}

Well, to answer your original question, I can be a mentor if not enough 
are going to be.

Some areas I can probably mentor in

XML (DOM specifically and DOMXML)
Inline Documentation
Test Cases for Automated Testing Suites
jQuery and JavaScript in general
HTTP
OOP

I have various lengths of experience with the above, but know enough to 
"wing it" in many cases. I'm probably strongest in XML, since I've had 
many projects which used the PHP extensions. Inline documentation is not 
so difficult and is pretty straightforward.. I'm just an egg when it 
comes to the true art and beauty of writing test cases, but I have 
enough experience to understand the concepts.

JavaScript is not so difficult (sometimes) and jQuery is very easy to 
work with. HTTP is straightforward, so once you understand the protocol, 
it is fairly easy after that. I've been working with OOP for 4 years and 
I'm still don't know enough.

Topics that interest me: Automated Testing, XML, and Inline 
Documentation. However, I can pretty much do anything with exceptions.

It's in Wordpress 2.3.3 the default and classic themes, in the file
comments.php. It uses "$id". So it looks like it's "latest standards
and practises".

However, at least on the blog I found it on, it was using the plugin
paged-comments plugin that might have been causing $id to be empty.

I just wanted to note that you can reproduce the blank screen when
posting a comment if the $id variable in the comments form equates to
empty. If Beth is see this problem occur frequently, you can double
check it: when it happens, go back in your browser and check the
source of the comment form. If you see comment_post_ID with an empty
value, it would be the cause. Something like this:

<input type="hidden" name="comment_post_ID" value="" />

The value field should be equal to the post id of the post.

$id is a global at that point and should indeed be defined. It's
defined by setup_postdata(), which is called by the_post(). Whenever
you're in a Loop, the $id global is valid.

So echo $id should return the post id. It should never be blank.

What's the URL of the page with the comments form on it? Is this the
popup form or not?

I'd be happy to mentor someone who wanted to work on security, 
accessibility or projects related to triaging bugs =)

I'd love to get in on GSoC as a student.  If I had the credentials to be a
mentor I'd jump on it, but unfortunately I'm not really qualified for that.
In any case, there is a project that I'd like to see accomplished, whether
as GSoC or simply as a wonderful part of WP in general.  That is some sort
of code flow documentation.  Inline documentation is great, and it helps a
ridiculous amount, but for those trying to get into WP hacking, the idea can
be daunting.  I've only been hacking around WP casually for a couple months
and the greatest obstacle I've faced is figuring out which parts of code
call which other parts.  It's not necessarily that it's hard to do, but it's
very time consuming.  An all-in-one code flow doc, whether it be an HTML
handbook or a wiki, would be really helpful, especially to beginning WP
hackers.  Just throwing it out there as an idea.

There is some documentation on code flow in the Codex -- at least an 
outline of what happens when you visit a non-admin blog page:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/Query_Overview

Also, David House started another page to describe code flow, but 
hasn't updated it for a year, so I don't know what his plans are:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/User:DavidHouse/Wordpress_Code_Flow
I think it was in response to this support request:
   http://wordpress.org/support/topic/33788

If you can describe what kind of other code flow you would like to see 
that would be useful, maybe you can add it to the To Do document:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/JHodgdon/Dev_Doc_To_Dos

I've just spotted another... say, "oddity", in the menus :

- by default and as usual, the top-level "Write" links to
post-new.php, and toplevel "Manage" links to edit.php, which is
obviously fine
- Go to "Write" : "Manage" stills links to edit.php
- Now go to "Write" then "Page" : "Manage" now links to edit-pages.php
- Now go to "Write" then "Link" : "Manage" links to... edit.php

So basically, a link with the same anchor text can send to different
location, which is IMHO a first usability mistake, and moreover
--second usability mistake-- this behavior is not even consistent (I
would have sort of expected that when on "Write : Link" the "Manage"
link sends to the actual "Manage Links" page, not the "Manage Posts"
page).

I've already expressed my disliking of the layout, but I think this
goes even a step forward in the wrong direction with things under the
hoods being counter-intuitive too.

What do you think guys?

To be honest I'm not sure exactly how it would fit into that To Do list, but
I'll attempt to explain in more detail what I'm proposing here at least.  I
stumbled upon David's code flow page before and found it to be very
incomplete in regards to what I'm looking to do.  I guess my aim is to
completely flesh out that Query Overview page, and then some.

It does a good job of starting the explanation, at least for the non-admin
pages.  What I'd like to see is a group of pages that explains not only what
the main functions are, but also what these functions do in detail.  I'd
like to see a document specify which filters and hooks are run at which
point in the process, and what they can be used for.  I'd like to see
case-specific data paths.  For instance, I want to see how a page is
processed differently than a post, how a pingback is processed differently
than a regular comment, etc.  I want to see this sort of thing spread across
the the admin pages as well.  Pretty much I want to see explanations of the
code, not just the code itself.

>From what I understand, WP is designed to be accessible.  A project with as
many lines of code as WP is inherently inaccessible.  In economic terms,
it's an oligopoly for experienced developers - there is a pretty high
barrier to entry, and that is determining quickly and easily where and how
data is handled.  It takes quite a lot of time to do without proper
documentation.

That said, I'd love to take this on as a GSoC project.  I'd start on it now
if I didn't have school to worry about.  Unfortunately I do, so I'll have to
wait for summer.  Even then, if I don't get in on GSoC I'll have to find a
different source of income and won't be able to focus my efforts toward this
project.  So in that case, I'd be more than grateful if someone else could
make it happen, either as a GSoC project or otherwise.

You can pretty much see the flow in wp-settings.php, or at least the 
beginning of it, when a function becomes available, etc.

Good catch.  I think the changing links actually works (that is, if  
I'm on "Write Page", the top level Manage link goes to "Manage  
Pages"), but Only If It's Consistent!

If I'm on "Write->Link", the Manage link should go to "Manage- 
 >Links".  same with the reverse.

Usually I'm right with you on this type of thing, but I must  
respectfully disagree.  Here I think it _really_ does work.  If I'm  
working on Pages, I stay with Pages by default.  That makes a lot of  
sense.

The design is thinking more along the lines of "application flow"  
instead of "web site".  Don't think "navigation" so much as  
"function".  :)

_That_ should be fixed.  Links should follow the same Write/Manage  
pattern as Posts and Pages.

Posts and pages bave been that way for many releases, only now links
is under there too.  We can make links behave the same way.  Patch it
up.

A few more thoughts here...

Yes, there is some barrier to becoming familiar with the core 
WordPress code base, but that is true in any large-ish open-source 
project. If you want to participate in the role of a core developer or 
bug patcher in any open-source project, you have to be willing to read 
source code. Is that a problem? I don't think so -- only people who 
have familiarized themselves with the core source code and who can 
read reasonably well-written code in the project's language should be 
proposing changes to it, and yes, it does take time to familiarize 
yourself with any fairly large code base. The code of WordPress is 
written in a pretty clear manner, in my opinion... It could be better 
documented (there are efforts underway to add PHP Doc headers to all 
the functions, another good SoC project), but if you can read PHP, I 
don't think it's difficult to figure out what any individual function 
does by reading the code.

Also, if you have a reasonable IDE on hand (such as Eclipse), if there 
are functions called that you are unfamiliar with, it's pretty easy to 
search for them and find out what they do.

My thought when I wrote the Query Overview page was to present a road 
map to how visitor-facing pages are generated, which I didn't think 
was obvious, even after spending the time to read through the code in 
detail. I thought that at least it would give someone a head start (at 
least tell them where in the source code to read to find more details).

The reason I haven't made something like Query Overview to explain 
what the admin pages do, is that I think it's a lot clearer there: you 
visit a particular admin page URL, and that tells you which source 
file is being used to generate that page. Then go read that file to 
see what it does.

My concern on making a document like what you describe, which goes 
into great detail on the flow, functions, hooks, etc., is that my 
experience in years as a professional software developer has been that 
the code itself is the only reliable "documentation" of what the code 
is doing in detail. Any attempt at having outside documentation 
explaining the code may be fine at the moment it's written, then 
quickly goes out of date.

Thoughts?

I suppose isomeobe forgot to make the manage called from write:link
pointing to manage:links, this should be correct for consistency in
the interface.

Actually after some use i don't dislike the new interface, ven the
write sreen, the only things i would like to have option and advanced
option for writing pages and post puttend in a tab we wil have a tab
for write, with the editor and another tab with option and advanced
option to avoid the need to scroll back and forth or forgetting to set
something important, maybe the title box onli coul d be tabbe so for a
post we have a tab title/tag/category etc... that sound not so bad for
interface, a post has a title, categories, tags... 

Another addition is to not count for default category during posting
post but if a post has no categories neither tags when u push publish
sould appear a warning, same for tamplate and mothers for pages.

Well, I do understand what you're saying about it going out of date.  That
is the main problem with documentation - that it needs to be maintained.
This is true of inline documentation as well.  It's never really an easy
process.

My point to making this documentation wouldn't be to facilitate the core
developers.  They obviously already know how things work.  As I said, I'm
proposing it to help out the casual developers - the people who are trying
to write a plugin or two for their site, but can't figure out how to make WP
do what they want, or the people who are trying to figure out what filter
they really need to, or to add extra functionality that they would have
thought should be in the core but they found isn't.  I know from my limited
experience writing plugins for WP, it can be pretty frustrating trying to
figure out how the actual code handles things that are pretty simple when
talking on the abstract level, just because things are sent around through
so many different functions and filters.  I mean, yes, you can use search
tools to figure out which file a function is in, but when you have to do
that like twenty times and figure out what each function is doing along the
way, it can be pretty discouraging.

Think of the WP motto.  "Code is poetry."  Yes, specially trained readers
(and/or literary geniuses) can read a poem, analyze it, and come out with
the meaning quite quickly.  Take a high school class.  You have a couple
kids who are going to end up as English majors.  You won't find them
complaining.  There's twenty-odd other kids in that class though.  Sure,
maybe ten of them don't give a crap about poetry, but there's others that
would love to get the meaning and just are having trouble with it.  They can
get it eventually, but it takes them a lot longer.  That's what Sparknotes
are for.  That's what I'm proposing.  And while they may not rely on it,
those couple future English majors like having Sparknotes around every now
and then as a quick reference.  It benefits everyone.  The only person who
really suffers is the one making the notes, since he or she has to shell out
the time.  I realize this analogy breaks down where poetry usually doesn't
change so much so often, but that just means more time spend by the
note-takers.

Once the main effort is put out once (which a full-time job for a summer
should be quite a step in that direction), then only a fraction of it must
be spent with each subsequent code release.

Maybe I'm trying to cater too much to the entry level WP hacker for the
taste of those on these lists (since most people here are veterans), but
it's my two cents so I'm throwing it out there.

Hi,

As far as I can tell from WP's code, what it *really* needs right now 
for starters is to separate code from contents from presentation.

PHP mixed with HTML is a Bad Thing (TM).

Smarty anyone ?

No offense intended, just a suggestion that seems clear enough to me.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

M?rio, there was a SoC project last year focusing on creating a template
system not using PHP. I'm not sure whatever came out of it, but it obviously
didn't make core or into a plugin. Perhaps someone could pick up where last
year's student left off and continue the project.
Dan, while I do think your idea is a great one, I just wanted to let you
know that was my proposal last year and it was rejected. I ended up working
on Podcasting support instead. I'm not saying it's not a worthwhile project,
you just might want to look elsewhere.

Ronald,

My intention was not to present this proposal to SoC, wrong thread, my bad.

I was more talking to WordPress itself.

PS. I suppose Google rejected your project, because such a thing as 
we're talking about is not news. It's not innovative.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

Ronald, your proposal wasn't rejected because of the idea.

We need an http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Developer_Documentation on
MVC, Smarty, etc. Similar topics have been raised countless times on
this list, and the response is consistently that a pragmatic, organic,
evolutionary solution to real problems is always welcome, but the
programming pattern du jour because of its theoretical beauty will be
ignored. Abstraction and isolation have both costs and benefits. I'm
not a programmer so I may have got that wrong ;-)

Now, back to the topic du jour. Who will be a mentor?


Hope that helps,

I think it looks pretty good so far. I think the boxes containing
"Flickr," "Popular Posts," etc. should have a bit more left-padding.
Other than that, I like it!

Exactly what I was going to say. I'd also suggest moving the Blog title 
and "Just another Wordpress weblog" line slightly away from the leafy 
graphic in the upper left -- since they are both white, it looks a bit 
messy in that area. I also think the Spam Blocked/Pages/Recent posts and 
corresponding content should be bumped a little farther towards the 
right so there's some more margin between the left and right columns (at 
least so it matches the margin on the Flickr/Popular Posts etc. links).

Cool graphics!

It's very good! I love the color changer, the search and feed button!
I do agree with Jessica and Hans regarding alignment and positioning.
Excellent work!

Makes me wonder: how come there's no wp-themers list ? (or is there one?)
This kind of "please give feedback on my theme" has to interest a
bunch of people (and presumably, might bore a bunch of people in
*this* hackers list :)

I have to agree with Jennifer because she is right. If what you propose
was done it would be one of a kind in an open source project. I'm starting
to see the arguments for why it should and how. I don't think it must be
as detailed as you would want.

It isn't so much as you want, but what you need as a developer. If you
only want the quick and dirty then you don't need work flow that is very
detailed. I think it would make sense to have a summary work flow of the
comments and popular, most used sections.

The problem then is choosing which parts you want to have a work flow and
which parts aren't used as often to justify a work flow. Work flows don't
have to be as detailed to need to be updated that often.

If I get Visio, I'll be willing to provide summary work flows of the most
used sections.

Of course, if the functions are properly documented, then they will have
@uses and @usedby tags. Not all of the functions have these because the
time needed is far more than I was willing to devote. However, a lot of
the functions documented during late December/early January do have @uses
apply_filters(), which document hooks.

I will suggest creating a phpDocumentor site for WordPress and checking
out the results, because a lot of the work flow is probably there already.

I think for most places, most of the functions don't have that many
dependencies, so following the paths aren't that difficult. However, many
functions have a lot of branches which are difficult to follow. So even
with the classes, following the work flow shouldn't be that big of a task,
except for finding where the function exists in which file (and again, I
suggest using phpDocumentor).

As flaming you would not further your enjoyment nor mine, I will refrain
from doing so. However, as a PHP developer, I /do/ find your ill informed
suggestion insulting. Let me clarify my position and allow you to further
clarify your position.

*Separation of Business Logic from Presentation*

You are confusing procedural code from ad hoc code. The debate is rather
that you should use procedural code to abstraction from combining ad hoc
code in the template.

See Coppermine for an example of ad hoc code and compare with WordPress.
Then get back to me. After seeing Coppermine, you'll realize that your
statement doesn't stand.

The rest of your statement goes into theming and I will answer it in the
next section.

*PHP mixed with HTML is a Bad Thing (TM)*

PHP is a templating language. You may argue this point, futilely, but let
me explain and use Smarty for the example.

What is the difference from this PHP code:

<?php if( expression ) : ?>
<HTML>
<?php endif; ?>

and this Smarty code:

{if expression}
<HTML>
{/if}

Aside from speed differences and disk caching to offset speed differences,
there is none. There is no difference to a designer from either one. The
only difference is that if you offer PHP, then the designer won't need to
relearn the separators from templating language to templating language.

*PHP mixed with HTML*

PHP mixed with HTML is only a bad thing, if you come from another language
like Java or Python (which both are awesome). PHP was made to work with
HTML and to come back and say that you shouldn't ignores the previous
point.

If you study Coppermine, you'll find the original argument which your
statement derives from has its history in ad hoc PHP development where
developers weren't using either procedural or object oriented development
to create a separation of business logic and presentation.

*MVC*

I'm not a MVC zealot, therefore, if you take the abstraction of MVC, then
WordPress already does it. I've said it before and I'm not going to repeat
myself. If you want me to further substantiate my argument, then you'll
have to catch me on a good day.

Oh wait, I left a comment on the Popular Ideas forum about converting
WordPress to MVC.

Basically, you don't have to use OOP to achieve MVC, you can do it the way
WordPress does it, or you can do it the way Zend Framework, or whatever
framework you want.

MVC is only a paradigm, a pattern, it is not so concrete as you need to
use OOP.

----

Please accept my apologies for using "You" as I mean, "I think what you
are saying is..." but I'm not going to go back and edit my email.

Please. I suggest you do further research on the matter and perhaps search
for, "PHP is a template language" on Google as these ideas expressed in
this email are not my own but borrowed from far more intelligent people
than I. Furthermore, they can better explain the ideas expressed in this
email better than I, but I'll happily provide an interpreted view of their
ideas for you.

If by any chance you'll be 18 on April 14, you're in luck.

        You must be 18 years of age or older by April 14, 2008 to be
        eligible to participate in Google Summer of Code in 2008.

(Yep, I'm one of the unlucky ones still.)

Not unless I age 4 years between now and then.

As a side note, any chance WordPress can participate in the GHOP?

Just letting you know, it's almost working. However, when after

How can I send a BBQ by air mail? I'm ok about the scotch, but I don't  
think they will accept a BBQ onboard.

FedEx can do it. Rendezvous sends out tons of the stuff every day. I
think they package them in dry ice.

Well, FedEx -will- ship to the PO Box, but often without delivery  
time commitments. I'm not sure the BBQ would like that.

Avoid the unfiltered Scotch, though.  He pawned some off on me -- dang

Subject: [wp-hackers] Upgrade sanity checks
Message-ID: <161617690802271204r72221593yf117f40fb125160e@mail.gmail.com>

Whenever an upgrade comes out, one of the things that we get a lot of
on the support forums is failed upgrades. The main reasons for these
failures are:

1. Database is setup without correct update permissions, so changes to
table structures fail and upgrade.php isn't smart enough to detect it.

2. Users fail to upload all the files to their site, and so unexpected
errors occur. Usually this is the result of some kind of FTP issue
where they simply fail to overwrite all the files (this happens so
often that we always recommend deleting the old version before
uploading the new one), occasionally it's simple user error.

Now, I've seen a trac ticket for case #1 before (and that can be
solved by better error handling in upgrade.php), so I was thinking
about case #2. Is it possible for the upgrade.php file to perform a
sanity check, and make sure that all the WordPress files are present
and correct?

One way would be to have it load some other file which is a list of
all the WordPress files, then check (and potentially hash) them all to
ensure that they are unchanged. Every time a new release occurred,
that file would need to be generated as part of the release process.
Of course, you would want a failure to not *stop* the upgrade, but to
get confirmation. The best user experience would be to put up a
warning message saying "These WordPress files don't appear to be the
correct versions: (list of files here). Proceed with upgrade anyway?
WARNING: Proceeding may cause unexpected results! Do not proceed
without knowing what you're doing. (Proceed / For the love of god
stop!)"

Just an idea. Bounce it around.

I discussed the idea of exposing the hashs with matt last year.

When I looked into implementing something to be deployed on wp.org I  
found to my delight that svn gives us everything we need already!

peter@epia (wireless:S.4) trunk 0 0.21 s $ svn info wp-blog-header.php
...
Checksum: 9f85abee432181b0b8e8f28310cff11b

peter@epia (wireless:S.4) trunk 0 0.16 s $ curl http:// 
svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk/wp-blog-header.php --request PROPFIND
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
...
<lp2:md5-checksum>9f85abee432181b0b8e8f28310cff11b</lp2:md5-checksum>
...

peter@epia (wireless:S.4) trunk 0 0.19 s $ md5sum wp-blog-header.php
9f85abee432181b0b8e8f28310cff11b  wp-blog-header.php


So if we want to expose the info it is very easy to get at.

Anyone fancy writing something which uses the last one to validate an  
install based on the svn tag?

Great questions Ozh! It varies based on project and student, but at a
minimum you should have a few hrs to spend each week with much more
needed at busier times.

"While the answer to this question will vary widely depending on the
number of students a mentor works with, the difficulty of the
proposals and the skill level of the students, most mentors have let
us know that they underestimated the amount of time they would need to
invest in GSoC. Five hours per student per week is a reasonable
estimate.
http://code.google.com/soc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_mentor_time

"From last year's experience, that sounds about right if you take it as
an average. More time will be required during the start of the project
and during the evaluation phases (mid-term and near the end). Once
things are under way and the students know what they have to do, one
hour per day should be more than enough time.

"I'd suggest asking for status reports on a regular basis (e.g. per
week) to get some advance warning in case things go off track.
http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-discuss/browse_thread/thread/e32b87da8c49f704

"Lessons learned from past GSoCs:
- Mentoring always takes longer than you think it will
- You cannot over communicate

I hope we are invited in the future. My guess as to why we weren't
invited to Google Highly Open Participation Contest [1] that just ran
is because it was our 1st year in GSoC and maybe because some of our
mentors didn't get the final reports in on time ;-)

+1.

In the meantime, could we standardise some keyword+report on Trac like
"have-a-bash", where we flag easy tickets for people looking for fun to
hack on?

What is the criteria for a "have-a-bash" item? How do you define easy?
Fixing easy issues in isolation doesn't often help that much get
someone in the door or help a project. What is interesting is when
someone stays around to fix the problems that their fix causes.

I've never found that it takes much effort to find tickets of various
complexities. In previous projects, a "have-a-bash" approach most
often led to the person creating the list of tickets being frustrated.
 What seems to work better is developers (mentors) being generous and
proactive interacting directly in tickets, and developers searching
out opportunities to work one-on-one with interested pupils.

Contributing to http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-tests/ would also
be a brilliant way for someone to get involved.

Lloyd

Hmmm... A quick check tells me that trunk has 487 files. I don't know
that it would be a good idea to make 487 requests to get those md5's.

Does svn offer any way to get them all at once?

We could have a script that gets (and caches) the MD5s for a given tag, 
branch, or trunk and returns them as a single array. I'd be happy to 
host such a script on api.wordpress.org.

One thing that seems problematic is the computing of the hashes on the 
client side, seems like newline or whitespace differences could impact 
the hash, though I could be imagining difficulties where there are none.

I'm guessing that the worry is a ghost. But let's try it for the hell of it.
Who can provide the Windows equivalent of this?

Well we'll be calculating this in PHP, not command-line tools, so it 
might be easier than I think.

Do you ever come to England? Love to meet you at a Wordpress
conference here. In fact do they have any wordpress conferences in
England and if not how do I go about planning one? Okay I'll rephrase
that last question.... If I organised a wp conference how do I get you
guys to visit please? Do I need to start the bribes question off
again!

Great idea, when developped I would remeber the programmes to not
forget that all this should works for localized files too (unless by
that time hard coded strings will be centralized in some wat avoiding
single file editing) this means give to traslation team tools to
generate righe check file in an easy way under linur windows and maybe
mac too

If I don't have a previous engagement, I'll travel to a WordCamp almost 
anywhere.

As for doing an event, there's a few tips here:

http://central.wordcamp.org/guidelines/

If anyone has done a Barcamp or Facebook Garage in your area they 
probably have a pretty good idea of what's involved.

On every release at locale.wordpress.org we can compute the sums and
hand them out to the api server. The client with non-default locale
will get both the official and the local set of checksums for the new
version. To me, it seems a tolerable overhead.

Happy hacking,
Nikolay.

Woohoo! Sounds like my bid to drag you to a vibrant Shanghai summer
might become a reality!
Get yourself prepared for a lot of Tsingdao Beer! And we can arrange
BBQ too... :)

Good idea, Nikolay!
I was worried about the compatibility of the upgrade check for
localized versions. Now you solved the problem, we should really get
the files ready for the cn.wordpress.org site...

How do localized versions of WP Work?
I thought it was just a language specifier in wp-config and a .po file?

In addition to the wp-config.php and .po/.mo files, localized versions
of WP can also override some WordPress files, in order to add in
certain translations.

Take a look at these files and you will get a feel:

Hm, Cheers :)
Well by the look of it, theres only a small number of files which may be changed by localised versions, So returning the list of Generic file hashs & the changed files hash's(for that locale) wouldnt add that much of an overhead at all.

Yeah, exactly. Like you mentioned, most localized versions of WP only
have the extra .po/.mo files, which will be even simpler. However, the
sanity checks should include other changed files as well.

Yes and no, these is some files that are tanslated (readme.html) and
some core file have strings that cannot be gettexted cause when they
are outputed the gettex engine is not yet loaded so we have to
manually tramslate them and this will break the original english
checksum. wp-config-sample.php is always translaed manually in theyr
comments to give helps about waht to write in it in locale languages,
efault theme is always manually translate d or some tema give a
version I18N and language files etc etc... (we in Italy give a copy of
GPL licence translated keeping the original one too)

So localizing WP is not just a matter of creating a single language
files.

Cheers also, I guess i should've realised that :P

I guess only knowing English can remove a fair bit of complexity from some software :)

Surely you are mistaken sir. All the tickets are fun to work on!

Seriously though, it'd be difficult as we all have different ideas of 
what's fun. My advice to people is to just get stuck in =)

~From my experience last year I think we would do better to have a set of

busy/unavailable.

We also need to centralise the reporting and feedback a bit more - and
ensure the students get involved in the community :-)

I am will to Mentor again this year - I would prefer to be a backup
mentor this year though as I will be out of touch for part of the active
program period and around the time of the mid-term evaluation - I am
getting married in June and then off on Honeymoon :-)

Same from me, Just take a glance through the open ticket lists:
Needs a patch:
http://trac.wordpress.org/report/13

Needs Testing:
http://trac.wordpress.org/report/16

Pick something that looks like something you could have a go at, and give it a go, Make sure to read the comments on the ticket, If it looks over your head, then move along to the next.
But quite a lot of them have simply fixes if you're looking for the issue, Once you get stuck into it, you can generally drill the error down to a single function or two, You might not be able to fix the problem, But reporting back where you think the issue might be can be great help to others too.

So, anyone have any documentation on adding custom buttons to TinyMCE 3?

I'm looking to update my plugin (

In general if it's marked needs-patch then it's a good place to start.

I was aware that $id was global.

I know. But I observed it being blank when I hit the "blank page after
comment submit" and then returned back to the submitting page and
checked the source.

I'm afraid I was not able to reliable reproduce it. What I did
discover was that it never seemed to occur if logged in as the
administrator. It did occur more often logged out. And when I was
using the paged-comments plugin, slightly more often.

I'm afraid it's not the popup form. It was occuring here:
http://thedeadone.net/demos/tdof/ with a theme I was playing around
with, but I've since fixed it. I've been told by users on my main blog
(thedeadone.net) that occurs to them frequently but I'm using
paged-comments there so that could be the source there.

I think that having the official md5 for each single version, even the  
localized one, would not be so hard; it just involves a bit more  
'standardized' dealing for officially localized releases, and if the  
files are hosted in the same place it would be easy; as far as I can  
remember only some languages aren't listed - yet - in the regular  
wordpress svn.

Beside of this, I think it would not be so hard to do, having an API:

WP check its version and release
? ask API the file list for that version and that release
? API returns the complete filelist and the global md5
WP checks its very same files and get its md5
WP compare the two, and do something.

maybe I'll try it this evening :-)

Two more things:

1) You can no longer see the full comment on edit-comments.php - this
can be a real PITA.
2) You cannot access the actual post from the "manage posts" page -
you can only access the link to edit them.

In some places the new interface is feels quite akin to Vista: taking
too many steps to do any one thing. But in others, I'm quite impressed
by the functionality that's been made just a click away.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Adding custom buttons to TinyMCE v3.x

I haven't worked with the tinyMCE 3.0 plugin loader yet. There are  
enough changes that it will require some rewriting for custom TinyMCE  
plugins that's for sure. I do know that it is suggested to use  
"relative" addressing for external plugin URLs for better security,  
but I do think that full URLs will still work.

You will want to check MoxieCode's updated docs:
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Index

You should also check the changes to trunk's tiny_mce_config.php file.  
Pay careful attention to:
apply_filters('mce_external_plugins', array())

It should be loading plugins from an array with $name and $url keys  
and then building the tinymce.PluginManager.load() javascript command.

A backup mentor is a great idea, or if two mentors are passionate
about the same project then co-owning a project would seem like a
great approach as well.

I don't think that was a problem, the problem if there was one, was
mentors not following up on missed reports or other commitments.
Sometimes this was a result of the mentor not having enough time, or
not being comfortable with playing the role of a manager / boss.

http://groups.google.com/group/wordpress-soc-2007/ was the
centralised, public place for reporting, feedback and collaboration.


>  and  ensure the students get involved in the community :-)

I think this really comes down to the relationship between the mentors
and the students. The mentors are WordPress' ambassadors to the
student, and play the most important role in introducing the student
to our family and the cornucopia of WordPress projects. It is also ok
if a student only particpates in GSoC. I remember what it was like
being a student and also trying to juggle work and other commitments.

I am adding a requirement this year, that student applicants also
write a blog post (using WordPress) about their application ;-)

For those willing, even as  co-menter or backup, I invite you to add
your information and your project ideas to

Actually, you can, you click on the date for that post. It is a
sublety that once I got used to it, I find is actually a nice
experience.

Vista is a nightmare for me, and so I was screaming as I read this,
but now that I have stopped, lets document (on the wiki?) [common] use
cases, what the experience of them with 2.5 and alternate experiences
(and how that would interact with or interfer with other use cases).

Considering a specific use case, and asking people what they meant by
"I miss the Save & Continue", Ryan & I have made progress on:
Draft: Save button behavior should be consistent

What is or was the plan for #dashmenu (atm containing just the
"Dashboard" link) ? Is this list supposed to be populated with
something else? (for instance on WPMU?)
I'm planning on using it for a plugin, but don't want to collide with
any other feature

As of a few days back, actually I think you can view the posts from 
that page. As of the last revision I tested, the post dates were links 
to view the posts, and the post titles were links to edit the posts. 
At least, that's my memory, and it may have been changed since then; 
don't have time to check at the moment.

It's not good UI design, in my opinion (there is no obvious way to 
tell what will happen if you click the links, and the column titles 
don't illuminate the situation). A simple link title that would appear 
when you hover would help; better yet have separate links as it used 
to, explicitly saying "View" and "Edit". My 2 cents...

Maybe I'm too much curious, but what kind of plgin can put a menu up
there? The only one that i thinc can logically do this is a plugin
that works over tha whole dashboard (e.g. a plugin that change
completly the admin interface)

Anything else shouldn't stay there thinking about the logical
structure of new dashboard

+1 in the dahsboard there is no use for title at all (if i'm not
worng) while title could be a useful source of info like a mini
interactive help for every element

Hi, guys. I find a weird problem on MySQL query, the DESC and ASC return the same result.

The SQL is:

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts WHERE 1=1 AND
wp_posts.ID NOT IN ('') AND post_type = 'post' AND (post_status = 'publish'
OR post_status = 'private') GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY post_date
*ASC*LIMIT 0, 10

SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.* FROM wp_posts WHERE 1=1 AND
wp_posts.ID NOT IN ('') AND post_type = 'post' AND (post_status = 'publish'
OR post_status = 'private') GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY post_date
*DESC*LIMIT 0, 10

both 2 queries return a same result, my MySQL server is 5.0.51. And I test it in another 5.0.36 MySQL server that's no problem.
Any one point my the way to solve this issue?

The Bests,

I'm going to be doing some spot usability tests and this list of

I hate to break it to you but TMCE 3 supports adding most video directly 
using the "Media" button (on the second row). Pasting the object tag in 
HTML mode works good too.

The API for external plugins as well as the structure of plugin's code 
is completely changed too. So all TMCE plugins will have to be 
rewritten. Good places to start:
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Plugins/devkit
http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:API

Of course adding a button that will insert some code at the cursor 
location is still quite easy. Check the "pagebreak" plugin that does this.

For loading the plugins is best to use the new filter 
$mce_external_plugins that takes an array 'name' => 'url' and inserts it 
in the zipped TMCE. It's best to use absolute url (with or without the 
host name), as using relative needs some settings in the init array to 
stay at the default values (that can be changed by a WordPress plugin), 
so it would be possible to break the loading of external plugins with 
relative url. TMCE would still not load a plugin from another domain.

The gzip compressor has changed too. Now it gathers all parts of TMCE 
and outputs the zipped file all in one go. The action "mce_options" is 
still supported, but deprecated. The action "tinymce_before_init" is 
replaced by a filter "tiny_mce_before_init" that is applied to the php 
array with all settings for TMCE. Also the zipped file is cached on disk 
to save some memory/server resources. This cache is invalidated by any 
change to the init array or by changing the ver=[number] arg when 
calling tiny_mce_config. The version is filtered by "tiny_mce_version" 
defined in /wp-includes/script-loader.php, so a plugin can change it.

There are changes in loading language files too. The language codes are 
only ISO 639-1, which is just the first 2 letters from WordPress locale, 
like de, fr, es, etc. TMCE will load langs/[lang].js when a plugin is 
loaded and if the plugin has a popup, it will load langs/[lang]_dlg.js 
when the popup is opened.

The loading of the default language strings is different too. Now they 
all are defined in tinymce/langs/wp-langs.php, so they can be included 
in the main .pot file and translated to all languages available in 
WordPress. A plugin can use any of the strings there, check the 
tinyMCE.i18n js object when TMCE is loaded, to see how to reference them.

Wow what a long email, I'll probably have to add this to the codex. Let 
me know if you have more questions, I'll do my best to answer them.

Publishing a well written proposal in that sort of manner seems like
it has a low barrier of entry for anyone, makes a strong argument, and
allows for others to get involved or run with your proposal.

Subject: [wp-hackers] What happened to the right margin?
Message-ID: <47C71825.6020001@laptoptips.ca>

Looking at all admin pages in maximized window on cheap 1440x900 LCD. 
Without the white margin on the right most have quite large white areas 
in the middle that makes them feel a bit awkward.

However all pages that include the editor become hard to use. At 1440px 
width the editor is over 1100px wide! It's pretty hard to read/write 
with so long lines. And many people have screens with higher resolution too.

Are there plans to put the right margin back in? Perhaps we can make it 
shrink to about 10px at 800px window width (which looks good and keeps 
it usable) and expand to about 300px at 1440px?

Other option would be to add max-width to some pages, although I think 
liquid is better.

I'm all for setting a limit on the window width, but I think if we do so, it
needs to be centered, not left aligned like it previously was.

I'll second the fact that it's hard to write on wide screens.  In fact it's
freakishly hard to do when I enter fullscreen mode on my 1920x1200 monitor
(normally I don't notice it as much because I use a bookmarks sidebar in
Firefox and Google Desktop's sidebar on the other side, in addition to a
docked Pidgin buddy list window, but regardless...).  I think that doing
away with the right margin convention was good though, especially for the
top menu.  That said, I feel like page elements would benefit from a maximum
width.  I like having things lined up on the left rather than centered, just
because there's no visual border on the left other than the window edge.  If
that's changed it could work I guess.

I think the plan is to set max-width to 960px.

Yep in MU it's going to show all a user's blogs, so you can switch

Well, besides the XML, which I think would be just terrible. Maybe when
WordPress switches to PHP5, it would be worth converting to just DOM.
However, it would only be worth putting forth that much work, if WordPress
would support PHP4.3 for another 18 months or so.

The XML proposal does have merit for template and plugin authors who don't
know a lot about DOM/DOMXML, but still want to work with XML without
Regex. Creating a library for them will stand up to creating such a
framework. However, PHP5 does offer better tools for XML other than DOM,
which would make more sense to be used. SimpleXML would make RSS parsing a
piece of cake and very quick.

Also, you can "import" a URL into DOM loadHTML() method, which is
completely awesome.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSOC Proposal: Improved Controller
Message-ID: <50133.198.209.170.9.1204249434.squirrel@webmail.santosj.name>

*Abstract*

Improving the current controller/query model to allow for simple hooking
for adding pages and queries. This will allow for even the most novice of
users to create pages not dependent of query vars and having the user
create pages with some tag. It will also allow better CMS capabilities.

*Solution*

* Single function for setting the permalink (also query path) and the
query. Then passing the function and/or page which will be redirected to.

* Improved API for adding query conditions (functions are easily added by
plugins, but need better way to hook into conditionals) with single
function/API.

* Will not change the concept of "Views" (see Template Work Flow).

* Create new library or improve current library for better testability
(current code might already have test cases).

* Arguments Against *

The current method works well and wouldn't need that much work to add the
above without to much refactoring. With improved documentation from
examples of the community, developers will know the ins and outs of the
Controller model.

Well, not everyone uses TinyMCE (I personally _hate_ the thing and
physically delete it from all my non-dev installs), plus last I looked, you
couldn't use it to embed YouTube, etc. into posts. Copy/pasting from YouTube
itself has always worked, but it'll break your page validation due to
<embed>, you have to click to activate in IE, etc.

I'll probably drop support for embedding actual video files via my plugin
through TinyMCE though as getting them to work is/was a HUGE pain. More than
happy to let TinyMCE take care of that.

Thanks a ton. A lot to read and I'm not that good with TinyMCE, but it's
sure a huge help.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Proposal: Integrate WP-cache / WP Super Cache
	into WordPress
Message-ID: <eff2e86c0802281852w220eb343k67f9e73107151826@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone. This is the first of at least few project proposals from
myself for the upcoming Google Summer of Code 2008. I will be bouncing ideas
off the WP-hackers list, so I'm looking for people's opinions of the
project. Also, if any particular project excites you, feel free to volunteer
as a mentor for the project.

* Abstract *

As WordPress accelerates in usage, more and more people are become exposed
to WordPress-generated database error messages on popular social websites
such as Digg.com. These error messages are by no means the fault of
WordPress, just crappy shared hosting services. However, people are seeing
WordPress as the perpetrator of these database crashes.

Many of these crashes can be avoided by using a caching plugin such as
WP-cache or WP Super Cache. Unfortunately, not everyone is aware of caching
solutions, or only find about about them when it's too late. My proposal is
to integrate a caching solution directly into WordPress, making regular
WordPress users more aware of caching, while making it more convenient to
use.

* Solution *

- Talk to existing developers of WP-cache and WP Super Cache about there
willingness to have their plugins included directly in core.

- Investigate disadvantages to caching. Does caching require increased
server requirements compared to a base WordPress install? Does caching pose
any security threats?

- Look over existing caching plugin code and improve upon where needed.
Ensure adding caching requires no extra steps other than a CHMOD of
wp-content.

- Improve existing caching plugin interface, making it easy to understand,
and as user friendly as possible.

- Look over feature requests for caching plugins. Evaluate what features
would be beneficial to include. See:
http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-super-cache

- Provide standardized plugin API, so plugins can disable sections of
caching, eliminating plugin-related caching issues.

- Investigate other areas of performance increases, optimizing WordPress
queries and load times where applicable.

The problem is, said crappy hosts are also likely to have poor
configerations that will cause even more problems. Sounds like a good
idea, though. However, it should be disabled by default.

Agreed completely. Should this idea be accepted, I would investigate
potential web host issues. I also agree that caching should absolutely be
disabled by default, because no matter how slick the caching solution, there
are always disadvantages to using caching.

I was about to disagree, when I remembered the hell of a past project 
that involved caching. I still think that the object caching should 
always be enabled. However, any solution that is accepted in to the Core 
will require test cases. I say this not to discourage, because really, 
it isn't up to me to decide.

I say that only because recently the current disk solution was stripped 
out of the object cache and any solution adding it back in will require 
support from not only the author of the solution, but the whole of the 
WordPress community. If there are test cases, it will improve the 
quality of said solution, and hopefully pinpoint where issues might come 
up in the future.

It is very interesting and as an user of WP Super Cache, I can say that 
most projects I've used it, it didn't give me any problems. (There was 
that one weird problem on GoDaddy that I was never able to figure out 
and since the site is high priority, may never find out). My host seems 
to accept WP Super Cache with very few problems (I remember none, but I 
have a feeling there was once upon a time).

I think the solution that WP Super Cache offers is a good one. It 
answers the question: How often are you going to edit a past post from 1 
week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or one year ago? Probably never. Also, 
in the best case, if the database ever did go down, the solution should 
keep most of the cached pages up for visitors to see. What I mean, is 
that in most cases (barring plugins, which can use the hooks), you could 
just serve the static HTML pages instead of making the trip to the 
database. Changing the theme wouldn't require "rebuilding," because only 
the post portion would be cached, also allowing for comments to be made 
and updated.

WordPress 2.5 is increasing performance in some areas. Perhaps, the root 
of the problem (another GSOC WordPress project) could be done first or 
side by side of this project if a student accepts it. There is only so 
much you can do for decreasing overhead and optimization. At some point 
APC or friend will have to be used for performance.

I do like the idea of caching, so good luck!

I'm all for the idea of including a caching solution into the Core,  
but I don't think that we should utilize a plugin, that has another  
plugin as a dependency. I'm not discounting their work -- I use one  
or the other of those plugins on all of my WP sites.

But there is an opportunity here to create a WP wide caching  
mechanism that could be utilized throughout the code to speed it up.  
The 3 step cache that WP-Super Cache does is fantastic, but its not  
complete nor is it an example of the very best caching solution ever  
-- again this doesn't detract from its usefulness or how great it  
performs, and is just my opinion.

Additional things I'd like to see in a 'core' caching solution:

Additional Cache back-ends (apc, memcached, etc)
More granular control over what gets cached (header & sidebar are,  
but posts on page aren't, etc)
Ability to use the cache api in my plugins
...etc

I do it all the time. In fact, I highly recommend going back and  
reading your old posts... it will make you a better writer, and let  
you fix obvious mistakes you totally missed before, but you'll also  
get an interesting look at yourself from an angle you may have never  
seen before. :)

Speaking of the Comment and Manage posts pages...

How about removing the Comment link under the main top navigation menu now?
http://spencerp.net/images/commentpageproposal.png

The comment landing page could be accessed via the main Comment button 
tab in main navigation menu, OR, the "All Comments" little link right 
above the comment section itself...

As for the Manage Posts page, it's pushing towards right side of screen 
again. Perhaps reducing the padding-right / padding-left on the Author 
column, or Date column would help that... I'm not sure what else could 
help prevent that from happening.
http://spencerp.net/images/managepostpagepushing.png

In other News, the Media Library scroll effect is happening again. This 
seemed to be fixed just the other day, but it's back again...
http://spencerp.net/images/medialibscrollagain.png

And last but not least, what's to be expected about older styling such 
as plugins or what-not. I know with the new admin design, older styling 
will have to be accounted for then. So, is there maybe a way to account 
for it in the CSS file perhaps? Well, until plugins and such are updated 
to the new admin redesign or whatever?
http://spencerp.net/images/pluginborders.png

I noticed this article was written up:
http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/02/26/wp-25-plugin-style-guide/

But is there maybe a way to help "correct/fix" those plugins, that don't 
really have much styling from the start? Perhaps a style "adjustment" 
for ones that really just have borders or whatever?

That is true. I do enjoy rereading the terrible writings and seeing all 
the mistakes I've made. I will say, that above all just writing does 
work well for me. I'm guessing your method, since it involves more 
thought and fixing old mistakes and therefore learning as to not repeat 
the same mistakes helps a lot more (that and I still terrible at writing 
kind of proves your point). I'll have to think that over, but with 400 
posts, I'm not seeing how that will happen any time soon. It is a great 
idea.

I do wonder, if you are the exception, and if that is the case, then in 
your case and others it would just invalidate the cache for that post 
and when it is hit again will be cached once that happens.

I also don't think APC, memcache, etc should be part of the core. You 
would either need more options in the settings or have overhead from 
checking to see if the functionality exists. Probably will want to stick 
with disk caching, even if it doesn't have as much advantage on some 
host storage. On some systems, as it has been reported in the past, 
retrieval from the disk is actually slower than accessing the databases 
(I want to say NFS, but that might not be right).

Thinking it over, I wouldn't want to be the person that would build this 
system. Thinking about all of the issues that might come up, I'm not 
sure that I'd be able to fix them. It is extremely fascinating, but part 
of it from the complexity of implementing such a system.

Thanks for the valuable feedback Eric. I agree, this would be an
excellent opportunity to start fresh with a new caching system. If anyone
has any examples of a PHP-based caching system in they feel is better than
WP Super Cache, I would love to see it.
Regarding things like APC and memcache, correct me if I'm wrong, but I do
not think the majority of web hosts would be able to support those
solutions. Very few people would benefit.

Regarding module caching and creating an API for plugins to easily do
caching, both of those thoughts crossed my mind. Should this idea take off
amongst the WordPress community, I will certainly look into those options.

Jacob, I'm right there with you on the complex factor. However, complex
tasks have to undertaken some time, and I feel this is a project that could
potentially benefit the WordPress community immensely. I admit, I don't know
everything right now I would need to complete the project, but that's part
of the Summer of Code. It's a learning experience for the student, and shows
the true power of the open-source community. If I get stuck, I have the
backing of my mentor, the WordPress community, and the open source community
at large. I'm not saying a student should undertake a project without
knowing a thing about it, but they certainly don't have to know everything.

I don't think APC and memcache work as well in shared environments...

It'd be interesting to see what kind of plugins would be made off of
such a system. A plugin that changes the theme when the site's under
stress would defiantly be interesting.

Just a quick note:

Keep in mind that the Object Cache has been removed from WordPress 2.5 (By default; Users can still add-in memcached/mysql memory tables/the original object cache via the override file wp-content/object-cache.php)

The main reason for removing it was that it was not enabled by default, and that there were more issues with it than benifits(IMO).

A HTML Cacher would be a nice inclusion in core, But its hard to enable as pure included plugin material, Due to the fact that its either enabled or disabled according to the file being present in wp-content/ or not.

I think WordPress would benefit more from only loading the required files in the long run, As thats something that Plugins cannot help with.

I would agree.  It helps to have conversation to ensure things are going
correctly.

I do think that a report should be submitted by the mentors every two weeks.
Just as it helps the students to report progress, it will help the mentors.

With a backup system there I agree the participation will be more rewarding
for all involved and will probably increase the number of volunteers.  It
makes me more excited about the program.

That is a brilliant idea!

Does that mean you are volunteering again this year?

Is it just me or are the main WordPress download links completely  
broken?

The zip tries to load as a page.  If I "save link as..." it gives me  
a 1MB file that can't be opened. The other download just gives me a  
file that can't be opened.

Something wrong with the headers, it's coming back with a content type
of text/html on all the zip and tar.gz files.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Can't use wp_list_pages multiple times on a template
	file
Message-ID: <b42f987d0802291448m466c8731x17572c9b59992774@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,

Prior to version 2.2.2 I was able to use the wp_list_pages() function
multiple times with different arguments, like so:

			<ul id="nav">
			<?php wp_list_pages('exclude=14,22,144&title_li=&sort_column=menu_order&depth=1');
?>
			</ul>

			<?php if(is_page(11)) { ?>
				<ul id="subnav">
					<?php wp_list_pages("title_li=&child_of=11&sort_column=menu_order&depth=1");
?>
				</ul>
			<?php } ?>

I had this code in the header.php file in my template. After upgrading
to 2.3.2, however, the page fails to load beginning with the second
use of the wp_list_pages function. If I change the arguments in the
second instance of wp_list_pages to match the arguments in the first,
however, the page loads fine. In other words, I can no longer use
wp_list_pages multiple times with different arguments.

Has anyone else come across this problem, and if so is there a fix? or
am I missing something?

Thanks!
Jeremy

Both lines produce lists as expected for me in trunk WordPress,
mutatis mutandis. I'd check to make sure you have the right page ids,
that there aren't interfering plugins, etc.
