How come is it reasonable?
It isn't enough that just using $file argument of add_xxx_page() to
build action names?

Conditions:
 a. in case add_xxx_page() without the last argument $function, 
    $file must be unique among WP and related files.
 b. in case add_xxx_page() with the last argument $function set, 
    $file is used just for action names, not used by `include'.
    so plugin developer could set $file freely like as an unique ID.
    Without framework's help that adding prefix from parent's menu
    text and `_page_', developers still make hook tags to be unique.

I agree with Gali.

I've got a couple of badges on my site, and I ask (nicely) that people
hotlink them instead of copying them - just so I can make minor changes and
have everyone using the same badge. I don't even monitor the usage numbers
because they really are meaningless. It's an impression. If this person
sticks it in their signature on a forum they frequent, it'll get billions of
hits; most of which are absoloutely pointless since another million people
are doing the same thing.

the mechanism seems thought out for people that put everything (almost 
everything... I haven't seen someone retarded enough to also put images) 
in one gigantic file; otherwise, it is really YAFL (Yet Another Layer -

in this case, $file should be a plugin_basename and that's it. no more 
action hook lookup, just include it if possible; this is similar to the 
current behaviour for options pages

Um? I can't make out, uhh, is that the reason that building action tags of
"admin_head-*" and "admin_print_script-*" with parent menu's text (e.g.
"option") and "_page_"?

As I wrote in ticket #4563, I think the hooks for a specific plugin should
be kicked, too.
For pages want to load custom css/javascrips.

While embedded "option" and "_page_" strings in hook tags are useful for
something. :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Strange behavior in plugin with main menu and submenu
Message-ID: <b76f24970707010551r7e5fc47cib543a7f40391255b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All.

I am writing a self-contained plugin, which adds an item to
administration's main menu. It also adds a few submenus to its main
menu item.  I want all code and formatting and everything to remain in
the same file.  It seems possible judging by this Codex page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus , but I can't
make it work.

Here is a sample code to demonstrate the problem (save it in a file in
plugins directory and then active Test plugin):

<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Test
 * Version: 1.0
 */

function test_menu() {
    add_submenu_page(__FILE__,'A','A',1,'','page_a');
    add_submenu_page(__FILE__,'B','B',1,'','page_b');
    add_menu_page('Test','Test',1,__FILE__);
}

function page_a() {
    print '<h2>hello from page a</h2>';
}

function page_b() {
    print '<h2>welcome to page b</h2>';
}

add_action('admin_menu','test_menu');
?>


This gets my menu structure just fine, but the submenu items don't do
anything (don't print out test headings).  If in the test_menu()
function I first do the add_menu_page() and then add_submenu_page(),
then I get everything printed out (both headings from page A and page
B).  I also tried sending __FILE__ parameter to each place which has
to do with files, but it didn't get me anywhere.

Am I doing something wrong?  Is there a bug? Is Codex documentation
accurate?  How can I make this work?

P.S.: I'm currently working around the issue with several files, but
I'd very much rather not. :)

TIA.

Yes, I think the Codex doc is correct. But there are two differences 
between what you did and what I have seen work in a plugin:

a) In a previous plugin, I put a function name in for the top-level 
menu (supposedly optional last argument to add_menu_page). That may 
not be necessary.

b) You have set the file argument in add_submenu_page to ''. It needs 
to be set to the plugin file.

With these two changes, your calls would be:

function test_menu() {
    add_submenu_page(__FILE__,'A','A',1,'__FILE__','page_a');
    add_submenu_page(__FILE__,'B','B',1,'__FILE__','page_b');
    add_menu_page('Test','Test',1,__FILE__, 'page_a');
}

Try that and see if it works...

I don't think it's necessary, but I added in just in case now.

I think that if I live it as '', then current plugin file is used
anyway.  But just in case, I changed these too.

In add_submenu_page() calls you have '__FILE__', which doesn't work.
I corrected it and pasted to my plugin and it still doesn't work.

Now I see the menus OK, and I see the output of page_a(), which was
probably called by add_menu_page().  When I click on the submenu
items, nothing happens.

Suggestions/ideas? :)

Thanks to both of you for the input. Do you have any trouble with bandwidth?
I know it's a tiny thing, but if you've got billions of hits on one tiny
thing, it can add up.

simultaneously - but each is like 5 or 6 kb! (yay for lossless png
compression!)

Anyway, if it gets to be too much, you just set up a server-side redirect
(htaccess rules) and point it to an offloaded server (flickr, amazon, etc) -
you can still control the content by changing the redirect whenever you want
- - plus if you want to hit-track you can do that too since it's still
counting as a hit on your site.

But honestly, it's not even a dent compared to the other bandwidth
consumption.

5-10kb per image + gzip == negligible impact :)

If I were to post a post today at noon saying that it's noon, that post
should stay at noon. If I change my offset to correct for DST and it
retroactively changed past posts, then the time on the previous post would
no longer say "noon".

Now of course that makes the timestamps relative to now incorrect (a post "4
days" ago wouldn't really be 4 days ago), but it's more important to keep
the timestamps of posts correct relative to the time then.

And of course, you can always just use the UTC timestamp stored in the post
and use that to display the timestamp if you really want to. You'll just
need to just a little PHP and date().

Sorry, I forgot one thing. As noted in the codex, for a submenu, the 
"file" argument (2nd to last argument) has to be unique for each submenu:

The file that handles the display of the menu page content or a unique 
identifier for a submenu of a custom top-level menu.

I'll clarify that in the codex...

Here's some actual code from a plugin I did for a client with its own 
menu section:

   // here is another difference -- I did not pass in __FILE__
   // directly, but plugin_basename(__FILE__)

   $confmgrFileName = plugin_basename(__FILE__);
   $accessLevel = 10;

   add_menu_page( 'Conference Manager', 'Conferences', $accessLevel,
                  $confmgrFileName, 'confmgr_conference_screen' );

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Conferences', 'Conferences',
                     $accessLevel, $confmgrFileName, 
'confmgr_conference_screen' );

   // here's the second submenu, where I chose
   // 'confmgr_sponsors' as the unique ID

   add_submenu_page( $confmgrFileName,
                     'Sponsors', 'Sponsors',
                     $accessLevel, 'confmgr_sponsors', 
'confmgr_sponsor_screen' );

When putting somebody's badge image on my own site, I will _always_  
copy it to my server. I've seen way too many sites where the whole  
page load has been held up by one stinkin' file from a third-party

Does that really happen? JavaScript is different from images - while the JS
may hold down the page until it loads, I was under the impression the
browser would just continue to (attempt) to load the images in the
background until they succeed  - without reflecting on render times....

Does it really happen?  Well, I'm not intimately familiar with the  
way Goggle Syndication works, but I've seen a LOT of sites lately  
that start to load just fine and then stall for several seconds  
(sometimes it _never_ recovers) and almost every time, the status bar  
shows that the part trying to load is from googlesyndication.com.  In  
the meantime I am looking at a blank screen.

Yep.. I've seen that too.

The difference is, Google Syndication (AdSense) is added to a site via
JavaScript hotlinked from their servers - not even an iframe w/ Google as a
source or (as other ad providers do to avoid this very problem) an image tag
with the source pointing to a dynamic URI.

In my experience, it's only JavaScript that can do this (Ajax Slowdown -
caused by the same thing).... JavaScript breaks a lot of the web! :)

I use Google (Analytics|AdSense) + FeedBurner (Flare, Ad Network, Analytics)
+ WordPress Stats

Google uses JS, but actually site owners have a choice of _locally_ hosting
the analytics JS - which I do. You are not allowed to locally host the
adsense, but I'm not about to disable it because of slightly higher load
times :)

WordPress uses an image.

FeedBurner uses JavaScript, but I've never had a problem with JS-slowdown w/
FeedBurner (and hopefully it'll stay that way.... knock on wood) though you
can host their scripts on your server as well if you feel the need.

Images can, and will, stop page rendering in some browsers *if* the
exact size of the image is not specified beforehand. Back in the day,
this meant width and height attributes on the img tag.

Nowadays, browsers tend to be smarter and they also use CSS for that
sort of thing. If the containing DIV is fixed in size, then it'll
render while the image loads without trouble. Or if the width of the
space is fixed, then the image height is just going to push the
content down it down uniformly, so it'll render along happily and just
do a big block shove down when it loads.

But in the case where the rendering of the page depends on the image
size, and there's no hints for it to figure it out, yeah, images can
still stop page rendering. It's more likely to happen with javascript,
mind you, but images can indeed do it.

Solution: If an image is giving you page load fits, give it an ID or
find the surrounding div or something and explicitly specify a width
and height. See if that makes it stop doing it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Nonce confirmation: what am I missing ?
Message-ID: <OF0394086B.8E465F8F-ONC125730E.00330205-C125730E.00431C7F@notes.edfgdf.fr>

Hello there

I'm currently revisiting my most popular plugins to harden a few things 
with nonces, and I'm stuck at how the "Are you sure" confirmation screen 
is supposed to work.

I've set up a minimalistic plugin example as following

// add the page
add_action('admin_menu', 'noncex_add_page');
function noncex_add_page() {
  add_options_page('Nonce Example', 'Nonce', 8, 'noncexample', 
'noncex_options_page');
}

// print form, check POST if applicable
function noncex_options_page() {
  if (@$_POST) {
        check_admin_referer('noncex-example');
        $value = $_POST['value'];
        echo "<p>You entered: $value</p>";
  }

  echo "
  <form method='post' action=''>
  Enter value: <input type='text' name='value' value='$value' />
  <input type='submit' value='Update &raquo;' />
  </form>";
}

(actual functionnal source at http://planetozh.com/temp/nonce.phps)

I've *not included* the wp_nonce_field in the form in purpose, to simulate 
someone posting from another page or domain, not from within the admin 
area, in order to always trigger the "Are you sure" confirmation screen.

So, the plugin page and the "Are you sure" page are at 
/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=noncexample

What I don't get is how the next step is supposed to work: while the "No" 
link effectively points to the referring page, the "Yes" button belongs to 
a <form> for which action is "options-general.php", not 
"options-general.php?page=noncexample". How could it work, then ? Posting 
the value to options-general.php has, obviously, no effect.

Same things happen to every plugin I've tried, for example with Akismet 
which AYS form POSTs to plugins.php, hence not working.

In function wp_nonce_ays() (in functions.php, line 1287), the form action 
for the "Yes" button is set to $pagenow : why is it not set to 
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?

Any enlightnment mucho appreciated.

Cheers

Ozh

I know there was a discussion about dropping PHP4 support for
Wordpress somewhere, but I can't find the discussion now, so I just
wanted to point out this:

http://gophp5.org/

It's basically a list of Open Source Projects that are teaming up to
drop PHP 4 support as of February 5, 2008. Two largish projects of
note on the list are Drupal and phpMyAdmin.

I just found it interesting. Might be worth some more discussion.

I think it still may be questionable when most hosts are going to switch 
to PHP5. I think once PHP6 comes out, we'll see a movement to PHP5+.

Unless you can name a major host that doesn't, we've already established in
a previous edition of this thread that all major hosts support PHP 5.

Remember, PHP 5 has it's 3rd birthday in a few days.  That's over 34 Web 2.0
years.

I'd like to see the switch to PHP5, and I can't think of a host anymore
which doesn't offer PHP5 support. However, most hosts still
aren't running PHP5 as the default PHP installation. They usually require
you to add a .php5 file extension or add some code to the .htaccess file.

Exactly.  Take 1and1, for example, a very large host.

Is there some test that could be done that would allow setup to
programmatically hack the .htaccess file (ala permalinks)?  I can see this
being a major technical stumbling block to new bloggers, and pretty much
rain on the "famous five minute install".

But as someone also pointed out, while major hosts may support PHP 5, not
everyone is on a major host.  According to nexen.net, 80% of php hosts are
still running 4.x as of June 2007.

I'll admit, I only read a handful of the threads on this list, and I 
have obviously missed most of these.  However, I thought I'd chime in 
with my two cents.  Go PHP5.  There's a big difference.  My number one 
reason?  It would result in a considerably cleaner code base.

I hope it works (convinces the majority of hosts to upgrade to  
PHP5).  I also hope hosts start making PHP5 the default (and require  
extra steps to revert to PHP4) instead of doing the opposite.  We  
should re-open this issue next spring, after that campaign has executed.

My host does require the .php5 extension, but if an application like
WordPress required it I guarantee more hosts would care.  Plus, we could
really crack open object orientation for all it's worth.

developers use them (they were highly recommended on the forums). They are
at php 4.4.7 unless you specifically request/enable php 5.

Most hosts are like that. They run PHP 4 by default, and allow you to enable
PHP 5. Which is usually done by adding something like this, to your
.htacess:

AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php

Or by using .php5 as the extension.

We are going to have this discussion over and over again until we set a line in the sand and say for example Wordpress 3.0 will require PHP 5.x 

Only when we do that, will the hosting companies react..

Gallery2 is also considering moving to php5 as well, and I know a number of other CMS's are also in the same camp, so lets stop talking about this and act..

Let's make sure we have really solid importers for all the CMSes on that

Agreed. Let's have WP 3 support PHP 5.2 (supporting 5.0 and 5.1 would be
silly), and continue supporting WP 2.3 w/ PHP 4 support for awhile.

We should probably still continue supporting MySQL 4, though. ;)

Title. But, the appropriate code should be "&#39;".

Should it not be using the "correct" apostrophe (&#39;)?

Regards,

While I admit I mostly don't care about PHP4 or 5 and leave this
strategic decision to big guns, I do think WP should officially state
about the future, be it something unclear and fuzzy as "WP 3.0 will go
PHP5"

If nothing is stated, sooner or later some crazy dude will start
rewriting WP for PHP5 and start a wphp5 project on sourceforge or
something. This will be no "threat" to WP's user base, but will
obviously dilute a bit the brand image.

Hope I wasn't too unclear, I'm in the middle of packing things for a
month holidays :)

Cheers,
Ozh

If phpMyAdmin switches to PHP5 entirely, hosts will have NO choice.

I haven't seen a major host that _doesn't_ use CPanel (at least for Linux
servers) - and the same for PhpMyAdmin.

They will have a choice to continue using the older version.

Yep, and their users will have a choice to continue using the 2.0 version of
WordPress too :)

I'd like to see how their users will react to that info: same as PhyMyAdmin
will drop support completely for those old versions yet those hosts will use
them, users will be forced to use older versions of WordPress. Neither
"decision" makes any sense :)

I believe the original intention was for WP-Tags to remain a lite tagging
solution, and plugins could hook into the framework and do pretty much what
UTW did before, except with WP-Tags at their core.

I think it depends on your definition of "correct" :)

If it bugs you, make a plugin to change the behavior. On my site, I
created a plugin for my local customizations (called "My Local
Customizations", coincidentally enough). Among other things, this includes:

  remove_filter('the_title', 'wptexturize');
  remove_filter('the_content', 'wptexturize');

In your case, you're talking about the blog title, so you would probably
want to hook into the 'blog_info' filter and  maybe 'single_post_title'.

Of course, this also undoes a lot of other automatic pretty formatting:

* curly quotes
* em- and en- dashes
* ellipses
* Trademark glyph

If you want to keep *some* of those, but not others, then you'd have to
copy the wptexturize code into your own function, do the remove_filter
as above, then add_filter your custom function.

As for me, I might re-enable wptexturize one day. I disabled it a long
time ago because it interfered with some of my more complicated code
examples. But I think we've made it smarter since then.

It's really very sad that WordPress isn't listed at
<http://www.gophp5.org/>.

Is it a leadership problem?  Is it that we don't care about the foundational
technology?  Os it is just that we're, as a group, gutless?

C'mon, let's join the party already.  The worldwide move to PHP5 should
happen in large part because of WordPress, not in spite of it.

&#8217; is correct for proportional fonts using normal "sexed" apostrophes.  The only time you should use a "neuter" apostrophe is in code or type meant to emulate a typewriter.

I for one applaud WordPress's resistance to holding its users hostage  
for the sake of software politics. I understand many people feel  
passionately about updating to PHP 5, but I don't think it's  
WordPress's job to follow that passion through. WordPress's job is to  
make software that meets the needs of current users, while maximizing  
the likelihood of adoption by future users.

The "wait and see" attitude that is so offensive to some of you seems  
like a leadership solution, not a problem.

Good point. It's also worth noting that we do *not* have a really
solid importer for Drupal. Might want to consider making that a
priority.

> (And wow that website is ugly.)

No argument here.


I do, however, think it would be an interesting idea to start a new
branch or something in Wordpress to explore the possibility of
allowing PHP5 only code. That is, start a new trunk or something and
allow changes to it to be fully PHP5, preferably setting the goal at a
minimum requirement of PHP 5.2.

Why? Well, I think it would be interesting to see how much better the
code could be if this was a possibility. Allow people to submit the
necessary changes and start migrating the code. If it doesn't work
out, no biggie. If somebody introduces something really neat, then
maybe it can be backported. If it gets good enough, maybe it can
become a baseline for 3.0 or whatever.

There's no easy way to tell whether having PHP 5.2 as a minimum
requirement would be worth it without actually trying it for a while.

Yahoo offers an "auto-suggest" service that could be put into a
plugin. UTW has it built in, for example.

Are there any other auto-suggest services anybody knows about? The
Yahoo service, frankly, sucks. It's terribly bad at guessing tags from
content, and I'm guessing that any existing services aren't going to
be much better at it. But then maybe I'm wrong, I don't know of any
other services.

And the yahoo service has a really low size limit (like 200 words?).  I use
UTW and the bulk of the posts I try to run through it, it pukes back with
"request too large".

It's important to note that phpMyAdmin is not a CMS and is used  
almost universally. For that to go PHP 5... yeah, every host on the  
planet will have their hands forced.

Whoa there, I think this is just about resources for most of us.  Supporting
multiple major releases of PHP has a cost.

So you have figures for what percentage of sites are running WordPress on
PHP4?

Good point.

Here's an idea...  Add some code to the WP-update function so that  
when it runs, the person gets a screen that says:

"Please help out WordPress development by giving us a bit of  
information about how your server is set up.  This is completely  
anonymous, and will only send us information regarding what types and  
versions of software is running on your web server (such as PHP,  
MySQL, and Apache)."

The page has two buttons: "Yes, send information" or "No, don't send  
information".

Might be useful if this is a regularly repeated discussion.

I have no problems with the "look" of it... It's just that google recognizes
the apostrophe (the normal one that gets typed into IE or w/e) as &#39;, and
not &#8217;, so it sorta screws that up if you have an apostrophe in your
blog title...

But, I suppose, I'll just make a plugin to fix it... I have some other
things I want to fix, anyways. :P

Or, they host it on a different server. :P cPanel doesn't really have
support for PHP 5, though... Although, hosts could easily have PHP 4 and 5
running and just make a "global .htaccess" (in the home directory, above all
of the user's account folders) with the code to enable PHP 5. Making it
default for the user's code, and making PHP 4 for the rest of the server
that may need it...

Wouldn't you just do it like this?

AddType .php application/x-httpd-php4

<Directory /home/*/public_html>
	AddType .php application/x-httpd-php5
</Directory>

Well, I'm 99% sure that code has something wrong, but you get the idea.

But doesn't Google ignore punctuation altogether? Or, doesn't it 
recognise &8217; as punctuation?

Well, I just have:

AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5 .php

In a .htaccess in my home directory (above public_html). So, a host could
just have that, but put that right in the global home directory (/home, I'm
assuming?).

Although, the code to make PHP 5 default can be different, depending on how
the servers setup, I find that the one I use is "the norm".

I don't think Google ignores apostrophes... I don't think it recognises
&#8217; as an apostrophe, though...

Well, performance-wise and security-wise, you'd probably want that in 
the global configuration.

Well, has anyone spoken directly to the hosts about WHY they're reluctant to switch?
At first, it may have been PHP5 incompatibility with various server setups and scripts. But now?

It may be just laziness, but for THREE years? Maybe they have a good reason. More than likely, they don't but just need a push in the right direction.

It's not exactly rocket science to deploy PHP on Linux - and even on Windows it isn't so difficult that it warrants a 3 year delay.

Instead of identifying the problem (lack of PHP5 support), let us identify the obstacles in the way.

They were reluctant at first because PHP5 had a bunch of issues with performance and stability. PHP5.1 was a lot better, but a lot were waiting to see how PHP 5.2 would pan out (which has been great).

A few hosting companies I have talked to are planning on offering PHP5.2, they are just working on the logistics of how. They need to keep PHP4 available for older apps, and want to make it as simple as possible to switch between the two. Overriding the handler is a great solution, but it will result in a ton of support calls/tickets. It might seem easy to us to modify our htaccess files, but to the average user (John and Jane doe who decided to start a blog to share their family vacation pictures), you might as well be asking them to become full fledge developers. Work for a hosting company and you will see what I mean. I did it for about 6 months years ago and would never do it again. You are lucky to get 1 in 50 customers that even know there is a difference between Apache and PHP (and of course it is like anything else - it's easier to ask support then it is to check the help/faq section hehe).

OK - that was a little dramatic of me. But the "force a change"  
attitude makes it feel implicitly political to me.

No - nothing like that. I was not trying to represent that I did. But  
if you look at what I was responding to in your message, it was pretty  
open-ended, suggesting gutlessness or poor leadership as the core of  
the problem.  So I just meant to suggest that market bravado is not  
particularly WordPress's resonsibility.

In the case of 1and1 (who I'm using for several sites) it just has to be
lazy.  They default to v4.x on their shared hosting plans (with the .php5
option via .htaccess) and v5.x on their dedicated servers.  The reason I say
"has to be lazy" is that the version of 5 they use is 5.04 -- the one
version that everyone, including the PHP web site says to avoid...
Sheesh...

And their servers are all running Fedora 4... And 7 just came out??

If it weren't for great pricing, and HUGE bandwidth limits I'd be elsewhere,
but...

I got a client who hosts with them. I noticed yesterday that they are still
running phpMyAdmin 2.6.4. I guess after they got the ability to do themes,
they just decided to leave it.

See, these people won't upgrade to PHP5 even when 6 is out!

They need their users to complain. Their users have no idea what PHP4/5 is,
but I'm sure a lot more know what WP is and when it doesn't work 1and1 (and
others) must get the message.....

Take my host for example. They don't usually upgrade PHP on their servers
because of the possibility of breaking a whole bunch of servers. They have
some servers that still have PHP 5.0.x on them, since when they were made,
that was the current version of PHP 5 out. But, their new servers have PHP
5.2.0 on them (not as default, though) since that was the version out when
those servers were made.

I'm guessing quite a lot of hosts follow something similar to what my host
does... I'll probably talk to the owner, though, and ask him if he's going
to "participate" in gophp5...

I don't know about that. What totally must have bells and whistles would a
WP built on PHP5 offer that it doesn't now, and would those new features
push average Joe to change hosting companies?

I really liked the idea someone else brought up of starting a PHP5 only
branch or fork just to see what can be done. That would give us a much
better way to gauge rather or not a PHP5 only would be highly beneficial
enough to the average end user. 

Another thing that would need considered is continued support for the PHP 4
branch. Say WP 2.X stays PHP 4 and 3.X goes PHP5. I would say we have to
keep supporting 2.x for a year at minimum. Again back to the average Joe
user. Him and his wife decided they wanted a place for friends and family to
keep in touch. They saw XYZ hosting company offering web hosting for $60 a
year, and best of all the only thing they had to do was login to their
account, click this little Fantastico icon then click on Wordpress. If they
just paid that $60, then a month later found out that this really cool
version of WP was coming out, but they can't use it because their host don't
support the necessities of it, then they might be a little upset (which
would be shared between WP and their host). 

I guess that's why I have mixed feelings over this whole thing. PHP5 only
would be awesome from a development stand point, but will it be just as
beneficial to the average end user?

In the end, yes, I think it would. It might not be in the beginning, but in
the future, we'll be able to make WordPress even better. We'll be able to
make it more efficient and more secure, and not have to work around
difference in PHP 4 and 5. It'll make development better, too, since we
won't have to test in PHP 4, too.

So, the difference isn't going to happen right away, it's going to be
something that's going to make WordPress better in the future.

That is what I was more or less getting at. I don't see a bunch of users pushing their hosting companies (or fleeing them) if a new version of WP comes out and lacks a reason to make them want to switch. If there isn't some great new features, then they will most likely stick with the status quo (look at the number of sites still running 2.0.x and even 1.5.x). 

Now if the GOPHP5 people can get Netenberg to join in and say that the software offered by Fantastico will require PHP5, then the odds of this being successful just skyrocketed. :D

Making WPDB use PDO would be a big enough feature. If the power of it is
explained to users...

Actually, Fantastico is one of the reasons why hosts aren't making PHP 5
default. Since many of the programs installed by Fantastico aren't PHP 5
compatible, hosts have to make sure they work...

Also, on another note, users that use cPanel could easily use it to switch
to PHP 5 (if that's how their host allows them to switch to PHP5, via,
AddHandler). They would just go to the "Apache Handler" page and type in
.php in the extension box and application/x-httpd-php5 in the handler box.
They could then add .php4 (it's hard to tell if hosts have this avaiable by
default) with application/x-httpd-php as the handler. Much simpler than
using .htaccess. All it does is edit .htaccess automatically.

It either supports it or ignores it, I'm not sure.

For example, Google for "lightroom's odd vista incompatibility" and Google properly returns the blog entry "Fix Lightroom?s odd Vista incompatibility", which only uses the proper typographical apostrophe.

Technically, Unicode 8217 /is/ an apostrophe, in the sense that it's the preferred glyph for both a closing single quote and an apostrophe.  The old typewriter glyph is mainly an artifact of a 7-bit character set and the limitations of mechanical typewriters.

This is an excellent idea that was on my personal todo list for
FireStats for a while now.

implemented it today, it will included in the next version of FireStats.

But, &apos; (the preferred apostrophe code by W3C, but not very many, if
any, browsers support it) is the same as &#39;. Otherwise, why would the W3C
recommend using it instead of &apos; for backwards-compatability.

It says "&#39; is the equivalent of the XML &apos;", not "use &#39; 
whenever you want to use an apostrophe in your writing"?

But, it also implies that &apos; is the correct way of doing it, but use
&#39; as the equivalent.

It's implied but not explicitly stated, and last time I checked,  
standards don't work off implications... wouldn't it make sense that  
the W3C would want &apos;, as implemented by the browser, to  
correctly resolve to the right curly apostrophe?

As it is implemented in most browsers (where implemented), it  
resolves to XML equivalent of a standard apostrophe, &#39. That  
doesn't mean it's how it should work, just what the current  
equivalent is.

Just a thought. ;)

All it says is that it's the correct way of getting a neutral apostrophe 
('), which is totally different to the one you should use in your 
writing (?).

&#39; is still useful, such as in situations like:

<input type='text' name='foo' id='foo' value='I like neutral apostrophes 
(&#39;)' />

...it's just not for apostrophes in your writing.

Apostrophes should be defined by the Font in use, not be what someone says
"should be used". The last time I checked, windows uses Trebuchet MS as the
font for most of the OS. In Trebuchet MS, the "neutral apostrophe" is used.
In other fonts, they might use the "curly apostrophe". The font should be
the deciding party on what the apostrophe should look like, not WordPress...
Or... is WordPress just using htmlspecialchars()? In which case, take the
last sentence and replace "WordPress" with "PHP".

What? It's not up to the font at all, ? is fundamentally and 
semantically different to ', and the former should be used as an 
apostrophe in text.

In the end, they're both apostrophes, and they both mean the same thing, it
just depends on the context of where it's used. It doesn't matter, they're
both single apostrophes, and everybody going to recognize them as that,
whether they're "neutral" or "curly".

True, but by that logic, we should also all go back to using  
monospace fonts and double-spacing after the end of each sentence.  
Aesthetics and semantics are nice sometimes.

Honestly though - users don't give a damn about under the hood. "Power" doesn't mean anything - features do.

Now if we used PDO to make it possible to connect to PostgreSQL and stuff,  small percentage of our userbase might just be convinced. But you tell the rest it's "faster" and "more efficient" and they'll just tell you it wasn't slow before.

Jamie: imagine at this very minute in the Fantastico mailing list, they're saying: "Now if only they could get Matt Mullenweg to agree to make WP only PHP5, our chances just skyrocketed" :P

About the only place Windows XP uses Trebuchet is in the window titles. 
All the UI text is either Microsoft Sans Serif or Tahoma.

That wasn't really the point... :P

Oh, and in Vista, it looks to me that most of the font is Trebuchet MS.

No way, it's Segoe UI. I don't know how _anybody_ could think they're 
even remotely alike.

Sorry, I have a typographically-inclined eye. ;)

I was just about to reply to the same effect :)

Trebuchet MS is the default typeface for title bars in XP - but nothing else!

Interesting tidbit: 
In some versions of Trebuchet MS (those shipped with Windows 2000 and early versions of Internet Explorer), the opening quotation mark character was flipped vertically. This error was fixed in later versions.[1] (i.e. the rdquo and ldquo were the same)

MS Sans Serif and then Tahoma were the defaults for Windows.
With Vista the default UI font became Segoe UI.

Vista wallpapers:
http://neosmart.net/gallery/v/wallpapers/Vista/official/ 
</shameless plug>

I just love Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Constantia, Segoe Script... hell all of them!

I got a chance to speak with one of the typographists (real word?) working on this project (John Hudson), really interesting just how much effort went into making the fonts look JUST right (days poring over a 2000pt blown-up version of each and every letter of each and every font, with attention to hinting, aliasing, size, transparency, etc).. Too bad MS didn't hire experts to design their kernel and pay it as much attention as they did the wallpapers (omg! Beauty!) and the fonts.. :'(

Actually the Fantatico thing was a bad example on my part. Why on earth would they push PHP5, when the product they design their software for is one of the biggest obstacles facing hosting companies to move to PHP5 - Cpanel. CPanel really need some competition out there. I just wish I had the time hehe.

There are a million ways to do it - but with one question: why PHP?

Not the language itself, but the concept. Why a web scripting language
instead of a C++ (or whatever) application with a frontend attached to it?

In the end, you'll be using PHP to run applications on the local server (or
at least compiling PHP with your own extensions) in order to interface with
the system. Might as well circumvent all that and use a native application
with a web frontend instead.

ISPConfig works off a combination of PHP, shell scripts and binaries. Then
there's Webmin (my favorite :D) That's written in perl.

Oh, sorry. ;)

It's close enough to Trebuchet MS to me. :P Although, I've never compared
the two... nor have I ever even heard of Segoe UI... :P

php web frontend + php cli backend, perhaps?
I'm not sure it would manage *anything* but it worth a try.

Next week i'm looking to code something like a proof of concept: a  
web interface to manage a streaming server.
We just want something like on/off button for an icecast server, but  
I think php is really more powerful than we actually consider it.

of course, we're talking about php 5.2+ :-)

I just read this comment on a blog:

"Regarding the WHATWG?s WordPress blog installation and the problems  
with it, I have attempted to get it to output HTML5 instead of XHTML,  
but the major problem is that there?s XHTML empty element syntax,  
string-based processing and other nasty surprises littered throughout  
the code, that it?s [not?] just as simple as writing a new template  
for it. It?s such a fundamental flaw in the way WordPress and many  
other CMSs have been built.  The best option is to write a CMS from  
scratch that uses real XML tools on the back end and serialises as  
HTML to output; but the amount of time and effort that would take to  
set up compared with the one-click installation of Word Press is just  
too much."

http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/11/24/Feedback-on-XHTML


I'm curious how much work it would take to do an HTML 5 version of  
WordPress? Any estimates from the group? Is this the kind of thing I  
could tackle in a weekend if I wanted to?

It is true that there are XHTML snippets hardcoded in the WP core. But
it would be a matter of a couple hours to find and replace that code.
(This would also be required on each upgrade.) Then you would need time
to create the template, which can also range from a couple hours when
taking and adapting a simple existing theme, up to a week and more when
creating a new and sophisticated theme.

Alex

No, but in some cases they can be interpreted the same.

The "single prime" glyph (a.k.a. a "dumb quote", or a "typewriter single quote") is way overloaded, being used for opening and closing single quotes, apostrophes, and the prime character used to abbreviate the "feet" measurement.

Using the proper glyph instead of the single prime is always desirable when possible (1) if you care about the craft of typography, and/or (2) if you care about your materials looking professional, and/or (3) if you care about your content appearing authoritative.

If you go to your favorite book store, you won't find a single book or magazine that uses the single prime in place of a right single quote, expect as a mistake.  Or a screen-shot of a blog.   :^)

I can understand that.  I prefer to think of it as "leading a change".

I don't disagree.  Where we see things differently, I think, is that I don't
see a public commitment to the effect of "WordPress 3 will require PHP 5" as
bravado.

>From my POV, saying that "WordPress 3 will require PHP 5" is incredibly
conservative.  PHP 5 is already three years old, and nobody's talking about
killing a PHP 4-compatible WordPress 2.x.

Within some number of years WordPress will /have/ to require PHP 5, if just
for security updates.  In my opinion, it /is/ a failure of leadership* on
our part if we can't give infrastucture providers and users a year-long
heads-up that a requirements change is coming.

If we don't give enough advance notice, then the whole thing becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy, and the WordPress project may in fact become
responsible for prematurely adding one or two years to widespread PHP 5
adoption, not to mention PHP 6 adoption.

*By "leadership", I don't mean any one person.  I mean us.

HTML5 isn't even supported by Browsers yet... It isn't even close to even
being finished, right now. So, you'd be wasting your time.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Please Help: Gallery2 Rewrites and Wordpress Pages
Message-ID: <1183949001.m2f.36189@www.galleryembedded.com>

Part of the technical challenges in combining Gallery2 Output within Wordpress is the clash of the Wordpress Greedy Rewrite Rules and Gallery2.

In the past, we found the most robust way to stop rewrite rules from returning 404's was to direct the output to an external php page which in turn generates a "Wordpress Page"..

Although this approach is very robust it is never desirable to have to add an additional file to the Wordpress Root Directory and it is something we want to avoid.

I have many an attempt to instead build a internal Wordpress Page and added a hook to perform a termplate redirect and although this approach works well within Wordpress as soon as Gallery2 Rewrite Rules are added to the Mix the entire solution goes south with 404 errors ..

For Example 

Wordpress Page -> /photos
Gallery2 URL -> /photos/Images

Gallery 2 rewrite rule 

    RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /photos/([^?]+)(\?.|\ .)
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/photos$
    RewriteRule .   /photos?g2_path=%1   [QSA,L]

URL sent to Wordpress would then be /photos/Images which Wordpress Cannot Find (IS_404)

I believe solution would be to change the internal Wordpress Rewrite Rules

(photos)/page/?([0-9]{1,})/?$
(photos)(/[0-9]+)?/?$

to be more greedy to redirecting any children Pages of photos to the parent photos but to be honest rewrite structures are not my strength and would love some feedback, suggestion or ideas on how to handle this..

Try putting your Rewrite Rules above WordPress', so that they're processed
first, and WP's won't see them.

I have to disagree.

PHP is a powerful -web scripting language- not a general-purpose language.
PHP CLI *is* the _same thing_ as the PHP web. Same engine, works in the same
way, does the same thing, and has the same weaknesses.

Only difference is, one outputs to the command line and the other to a net
socket.

It doesn't really make a difference if we're talking PHP5 or PHP3 - it
wasn't made to do this in the first place.

It's not the language so much as it is the implementation. For instance,
with PHP-Phalanger (CLR/.NET version of PHP), it's no longer PHP - you code
in PHP and it gets changed into the same machine code it would be if it were
written C++. But when you're running php-cgi or isapi or mod_php, it was
never intended to do anything but web scripting and I doubt even the guys at
php.net would recommend for such a job.


PHP may be more powerful than we think *as a web scripting language* but not
as a desktop application....

Sure, on Linux you have the (PHP|Python|Perl)-Gtk libraries which let you
(very badly) tie a PHP script to a non-HTML GUI, but the best they can do is
call up CLI commands and attempt to parse their output. So while you can
have the PHP script call up `shutdown -r now` you're going to be SEVERELY
limited by the lack of communication with other applications and the
Linux/Windows API for whatever it is you're doing.

I happen to stumble on a little plugin -> WordPress Internal Rewrite Viewer Plugin which gave me enough clues to get this working..

One issue I did find was when WP Permalinks are set back to default, WP leaves the rewrite rules behind in the .htaccess and more important no rewrite filters are being called which is a very quick way to = broken URL's.

I was thinking about PHP as a *scripting* language, regardless of web- 
or-not-web prefix, just another language you can use in writing  
system scripts.
I think that if I can do something in bash, I would be able to do the  
same thing in php, but with a weblike interface. Or at least try it  
and waste my time.
But if you disagree in that way, I'll surely consider another  
approach. I haven't a *guru* suffix in my nickname :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Problems with wp.org-hosting.
Message-ID: <4691FAAD.1040504@gmx.net>

(Sorry if this is a dup - but it seems like the first mail didn't get
through)

I already sent this to Michael Adams, but didn't get an answer yet. So I
was hoping someone here might be able to help me:

Hi.
It seems like the way the zips on wp-plugins.org are created has
changed. They don't include the whole wp-content thing anymore, but only
a dir with the plugin-name. The problem for me is, that I have two
Plugins. One in the plugins root dir (which fixes a mail-problem/bug in
WP 2.2) and the main plugin in the post_notification dir. The zips
caused some trouble because users get quite confued installing and I
don't really know how to address this at the moment.

So here come the questions:
- Is this change wanted?
- How do I get informed about stuff like this (I just subscribed to
wp-hackers, but maybe there is some other place, too)
- Why are the screenshots and readme.txt included in the zip? - imho at
least the sceenshots shouldn't blow up the zip
- Is the code doing this stuff available? (To write a patch or to do a
work around)
- Where else can I beg for support?

Cheers

Morty

Yes, but why should that be bad thing?

PHP5 is object oriented and has a larger and easier-to-maintain libraries than 
PHP3. Evolution it's called, I believe.

No difference using PHP-Phalanger or mod_php. It's the same code and the same 
library. Configuration files (php.ini) might be different, but that's it.

Why bring up desktop applications at all? It could be a server (daemon) 
application (using SOAP, CORBA or something) that integrates with all those 
other applications to control the various parts of the server.

Gtk-bindings (and other bindings) are just wrappers around C/C++ functions.

many people would argue that this is ok for a web interface that in some 
way (homegrown protocol/XMLRPC/SOAP/REST/JSON/your acronym here) 
communicates with a backend written in a programming language (which is 
not necessarily C/C++/Java - Perl and Python have much better 
integration with Unix and are far easier to secure and debug (ever tried 
to find your way through a threaded STL C++ application? oh, the horror...))

as someone else said, those are just bindings that let you access the 
Gtk/Qt/wx/whatever libraries, they won't usually limit you much

Parts of it are stable, and parts _are_ implemented. <canvas> is  
implemented in WebKit, Gecko, and Presto. The parsing algorithm is  
being used when bugs in their current parsers are being found, and  
the HTML5 parsing algorithm fixes it. Presto supports all of Web  
Forms 2.0. A large part of HTML 5 is merely documenting what browsers  
already do, but is completely unspecified.

With the current HTML 5 Editor's Draft, using the default theme, all  
you need to do is change the DOCTYPE. Void elements can have a single  
U+002F (/) at the end, <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> is  
valid (though any other value of @xmlns, or even having it on any  
other element, is illegal).

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come off as arrogant or anything, I was just
stating my opinion as I saw it. (and my screen name is just that - a screen
name - and not intended to imply or otherwise state anything).

My point was that (in my humble opinion) it wouldn't make sense to use a
script to run a *second* script/cli to get that at the info. (in my humble
opinion) It makes more sense to write a system monitoring program in a
language that can -directly- interface with the applications you want to
monitor/manage. As in, instead of running a mysql command line tool to get
the number of active MySQL connections, if you were to write the program in
C in the first place, you could use the MySQL APIs directly and save time,
size, performance, and compatibility.

(in my humble opinion) That would be the best way to go. I don't get to
decide (nor do I want to) what people do with their time or how they choose
to tackle a particular problem. The whole point of the mailing lists (in my
humble opinion - just how many times do I have to say that anyway?) is
pretty much peer review. Throw an idea, and people criticize.... it's more
fun than being a bobble-head/yes-man anyway.

I was just giving my two cents why - in my opinion - PHP may (or may not) be
the way to go. I mean, what's the point of posting on a mailing list anyway
if there aren't going to be any "other ideas" present? I'm not saying your
idea in particular is wrong - I'm only giving reasons why I think there may
be a better way. And I'm *sure* that for every correct thing I say there are
a hundred *more correct* things to be said - it's all a process of
constructive criticism, brain-storming, and building up a better foundation
for whatever it is we want.

So sorry if I came off a bit strong-headed, that was most definitely not my
intention. 

(Maybe I should just start putting a disclaimer in my signature, change my
screen name to John Smith, post one-liners, and say yes to every idea that's
gets raised?)

I haven't looked in detail, but most of the differences between XHTML
and HTML5 are pretty minor from what I've seen -- a few minor tag
differences, some new attributes... It might not be *too* hard to write
a plugin that buffered WP's output, then filtered it into HTML5 before
sending to the browser. As others have said, when we start reading that
Firefox is getting built-in support for HTML5, maybe it will be worth
looking into.

Storing everything as XML on the backend and transforming it to various
output formats at render-time is great when you need that kind of
flexibility. And if it came down to it, modifying WordPress to do that
probably wouldn't be as hard as you might think (XHTML is supposed to be
XML-compatible, after all). But what audience would we be serving by
doing so? What kinds of problems would we introduce for the rest of our
users (i.e., the majority of them) in the process?

However, that's not WP's main mission. WordPress is a great platform for
advanced users who want to do new and interesting things. But at the
same time, it is meant to be a package that the average person can use
easily. The largest portion of our user base doesn't care if we can
transform our output into XHTML 1.1 Strict, HTML 4, HTML 5, Atom, RDF,
PDF, DocBook,  or plain text at the flip of a switch. The average user
just wants it to look decent when somebody hits their site in a browser.
And if the site "validates" according to whatever that W3C things is,
then that's probably a good thing, right?

I fail to understand the problem. Could you describe the setup in more
detail? I don't use Gallery and so I don't understand what you're
trying to do here or what its rewrite rules are.

It reads like you have Wordpress installed at the root, then have a
Page called "Photos", but I don't understand where or how you're
calling gallery. What is /photos/images? Is it a real directory? Where
is Gallery installed, what are its rewrite rules?

Any rewrite problem can be solved, you just have to give all the details.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Lunarpages PHP5 Discussion
Message-ID: <000801c7c26b$64d33140$2e7993c0$@net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I was speaking to a good friend of mine at Lunarpages about our PHP5 dilemma
and pretty much asking if she had any idea what it would take to get this
switch to actually happen (if ever) - seeing as she works at one of the
biggest webhosts I figured I'd see what she thought.

Basically it was like most of the comments in the previous thread were
saying, it's pure laziness and there is no real good reason for it.

She showed me something really interesting - their implementation of PHP5
(5.2.3 -and- due for an upgrade) is a big button in the customer's control
panel that says "Switch to PHP (4|5)" and the client just has to press it
and the .htaccess file is auto-created - pretty simple, I don't get why all
the other hosts are making such a fuss.

Anyway, it seems Lunarpages is pretty keen on the PHP5 campaign: I barely
finished with that conversation when this appeared on their blog:
http://blog.lunarpages.com/2007/07/09/lunarpages-loves-wordpress/

It looks like Lunarpages is committing themselves to providing as recent
versions of PHP5 as are necessary, offering a discount too.


I'm wondering if other hosts wouldn't be willing to take a leaf out of their
book - I mean it's not as if it's in 1and1|dreamhost|aso|whatever's favor to
lose customers *if the switch ever happens*  I mean, they're GOING to switch
to PHP5 in the end, so I bet if WP said "we're not supporting PHP4 any more"
that's what it would take.... 

(Note: new thread started to focus on the aspect of getting the hosts to
switch over to PHP5 - not whether or not WP itself should be PHP5'd)


Cheers,

If they really mean it, they should make the "single click php5" tool
available so other vendors will be able to integrate this as well.
show them the light, and they will follow.

I'm going to talk to my host's (BlueFur) owner about this... See if I can
get him to go along with this "campaign".

I know it's probably NOT what most people use, but I do know that 
Rackspace has no problem setting up PHP 5.2 on their servers.

BlueFur (http://bluefur.com/) has just told me that all of their new servers
have PHP 5.2 (which I already knew) and that over the coming months they'll
be upgrading their older servers
to PHP 5.2. They're also going to see if they can put a PHP Switch function
into the control panel (cPanel).

Add BlueFur to the imaginary list. :P

Media Temple (my host) has an easy option for switching to PHP 5.2 in their
control panel's PHP settings. It's a matter of toggling an option and your
site is on PHP 5.2.
However, this only applies for Grid Server customers. Customers on the old
Shared Server still have PHP4 (with no PHP5 option), but will migrated to
Grid Server shortly (and have PHP5). Dedicated virtual customers currently
do not have a PHP5 option either, but I'm sure (mt) would install PHP5 on
(dv) if bugged.

Actually, (dv) users do have a PHP 5 option, and it's relatively  
simple to setup on a per-domain basis -- just create a copy of the  
FastCGI binary, and add a few vhost.conf entries (kind of like  
the .htaccess config options). It isn't exactly user-friendly, but if  
you feel you need a dedicated server, you probably know a thing or  
two about setting things up yourself. ;)

Personally, I just downloaded my own version of PHP 5 with Yum,  
because I wanted a newer version that was more easily updated (which  
is another easy option to getting PHP 5 on a (dv)).

Hiya Otto,

Thanks for your reply to answer your Q and yes I have an internal solution working now thanks to using query_vars & rewrite_rules_array

1. no /photos/images does not exist in either Gallery2 or Wordpress it is a result of the Gallery2 rewrite rules.
2. I  had already posted the Gallery2 rewrite rule in question in my first post.
3, I have a number of different installs in different locations, some root some subdirectories to ensure the WPG2 plugin will work in different locations.. 
4. Calling Gallery2 is via a series of embedded API Calls, which I open up and retrieve Gallery2 data using the template redirect hook to generate the output..

it is pretty complex to overlay Gallery2 within Wordpress and getting all these events to work within a internal Wordpress Page is proving problematic.  I be happy to take anyone through the concepts if you are interested you can contact me via the WPG2 forums..

What is the process here to get a trac ticket championed and added to the codebase? Opening a ticket is simple, adding a patch is not hard however the tricky part is getting the ticket added to code which seems to be pretty hit and miss..

Everyone speaks so highly of THE "mediatemple" and yet they don't even have
proper PHP5 support.....

The steps you described can actually be done on shared hosts with other
hosting companies as well (but with .htaccess) so long as the user is given
SSH access.

Just compile the PHP code, stick it in a directory, and point it with
htaccess... But who the hell is going to go through all that?!

Wait and be patient. The developers who are able to test and commit
patches to trunk are busy. They have different priorities to you and
will view your ticket more dispassionately than you ever will.

It is a little bit slower right now with summer and Robin away.

No, actually, it's not all that hard... It might be difficult to do as
a plugin, but then I don't really know, I have not tried to make a
nice automated plugin out of it.

Well, I'll pass then. I really would have preferred it if you would
describe the setup in more detail here. It sounds to me like you're
doing things the extremely difficult way, and I'm was trying to
understand how you're doing it and why. But if you're not actually
interested in discussing it, then that's fine too.

&apos; is an XML entity, and is not defined in HTML 4.01 (and  
therefore it is listed under the Appendix C guidelines for serving  
XHTML 1.0 as text/html). In reality, every browser supports it even  
in HTML. It's specified in the HTML5 draft, though.

Thanks it is not actually my ticket :-)  I was going to open up a ticket with a patch to ensure that we had a hook on the deactivation of the permalinks so I could automatically adjust/deactivate the Gallery2 rewrite rule set.. 

As for patience, I am well aware of developers schedules, I been around the block a few times, including a few years of working with the Gallery2 developers..

IE7 doesn't support &apos;

Oh, and &apos; looks like a neutral apostrophe in Firefox, Opera and Safari.

IE doesn't support it? That surprises me. And yes, it is just U+0039  
(as that is what it is defined to be).

So if it's just a neutral apostrophe, and you "should" use &apos;, then I've
been right all along... :P

Are you being deliberately obtuse or something? There are times when you 
should use the neutral apostrophe, or else it wouldn't exist: however, 
one of these times is *not* as an apostrophe or single quotation mark in 
normal text when you're able to use more than just ASCII. "don't" is 
wrong, "don?t" is right; "'I went to the shops', said Mary." is wrong, 
"?I went to the shops?, said Mary." is right; etc. etc. etc.

Nobody will throw a fit if you use the typewriter/neutral apostrophe 
instead of the correct characters, but why on earth would you go out of 
your way to change WordPress's behaviour from correctly using smart 
quotes to only using dumb ones?

I was just kidding on my last message. I didn't even know there were 2
different apostrophes...

Blog posts consisting of code. If you replace neutral apostrophes  
with curved ones in PHP, you end up with parse errors, meaning anyone  
wanting to use the code has to go through and modify it. Also, there  
are probably other bugs in the code.

It isn't really going out of your way anyway, as you just have to  
remove a default filter.

Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to change the filter so as not to
modify things inside pre or code tags?

If thats the case, I Wish others who post code in their blogs would take
advantage of it, Retyping, or using Find-Replace is getting tedious when
trying various things mentioned on certain blogs :)

There's now a far bigger reason for this: PHP4 EOL has been announced!

great.

along with the gophp5 campaign, this could give the transition some
momentum.


btw: how cool is that, PHP 4.4 will die at 08/08/08 :).

If you are not php 5 soon you are going to be in danger of being branded
*legacy software*. :)
Unlike Habari for instance. :)

WordPress 2.3 / 3.0 / whatever (the next large release) going PHP5 if
there's a benefit gets my vote. Users stuck on PHP4 can stick to 2.0 / 2.2 /
whatever which will stay secure.

Frankly, I think if it were up to hosts, they'd all still be on PHP3 or
worse. But packages moved on and hosts were forced to update, and for their
and their users own good. Hosts need to get with the times and a little
nudge from packages like WordPress wouldn't be a bad thing in my book. Plus
hell, people really shouldn't stick to hosts who refuse to update.

My 2 cents.

Gallery2 has also posted that as from after 2.3 (the next release) PHP 4 support will also be dropped.. (sometime around 5th of Feb, 2008)

I think it is now time for Wordpress to also draw the end of php 4 line in the sand...

I say make 3.0 PHP5 and keep 2.X as 4. We can continue supporting 2.X for
some time, but if PHP is dropping their 4.X branch, then it only makes sense
for us to move on also. 

This will also give people who are on hosts that don't want to change enough
time to either stick with outdated software, or look for a host that will
keep up. I like the idea of giving end users a year of continued support on
the PHP4 branch. I know a lot of people out there with small WP sites on
little shared hosting accounts, and they pay for their service a year at a
time. 

I was on the fence about this before, but this news has converted me.

Well, now that PHP is dropping support for PHP 4, I would think it would be
safe to set a date next year when WordPress goes PHP5.

Maybe this has to do with the "How" rather than the "What" of your

you got any response at all.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP_Cache and contents filtering
Message-ID: <20070718103723.AD64.TOHRU@nakarika.com>

Hi,

WP_Cache might be incompatible with contents filtering in some
situations.
I'm seeking any ideas to solve this problem.

I've installed Gengo, a plugin for make a wp site multilingual.
Visitors will see not all posts of the site but ones written in their
preferred language. That's one of Gengo's feature, site contents
filtering.

With WP_Cache, contents delivering flow could go wrong.
Let's look in how `wp_list_pages()' works.

--

These are 2 pages
  Id 1: About(en)
  Id 2: About(ja)

When the first visitor visits in en_US locale context, wp_list_pages()
begin fetching pages for output, calls get_pages().
Inside of get_pages() it once get all pages Id 1 and 2 but passes them
to filter handlers and Gengo will filter to leave only the Page [PageId:1].
Then get_pages() caches the result [PageId:1] into the storage.
As the result wp_list_pages() outputs a link of [PageId:1].

Next visitor comes, seems from ja_JP locale region.
wp_list_pages() calls get_pages().
get_pages() peeks cache and finds the subject, the previous call's
result [PageId:1]. Then dispatch filters and Gengo eliminates it because
[PageId:1] is not for the locale `ja' but for `en'.
As the result wp_list_pages() gets no page from get_pages(), so it
outputs no page link.

--

Similar behavior will be shown with categories and maybe others.
How can it be solved?

My ideas:

a. let plugins to implement functions alike get_pages and others just for
   manage caches.
   -> bad for maintenance: anti-patten `Copy and paste programming'.

b. make cache be structured.
   How about to setup cache storages for each locale, for example?
   The current cache implementation supports grouping. But its group
   name is hard-coded in general, you can see how get_pages() calls:
     wp_cache_get('get_pages', 'page').
   But with a bit of modification, you would be able to store a kind of
   information for each context.
   I got 2 ways in my mind:
     i)  make cache directory structured.
         Add a variable $subdir or something to WP_Object_Cache and
         add ways to set the value somehow.
         Directories `cache/en/', `cache/foo/bar/ja' would be made.
     ii) provide filters to manipulate a group name.
         Change some WP_Object_Cache's methods like get/set methods to
         call that filters.
         Group name `page' would be changed to 'page_en'.

   -> Caches can be retrieved anytime - not only after initialization of
      plugins but also before or middle of it.
      In this case cache structure could change gradually. It could be
      happened that fetching cache A from the directory 'cache/' then
      fetching cache A again but from 'cache/en/' then storing cache A
      into 'cache/en/foo/'.
   -> In addition, some variables are cached as global variables.
      One of them is `$alloptions', used by get_option() family.
      It will be hard to manage.

c. modify core code where manage caches to be locale aware.
   For instance, get_pages() will call wp_cache_get() like:

     $locale = get_locale();
     if ($cache = wp_cache_get('get_pages', "page_$locale"))
    
   -> It seems the best of the three to me if there is no other
      issue on cache.
      But is it true? Only for locale? Does it make sense?


Any opinions and/or ideas?

Hi, is there an easy way to stop WordPress from generating 404 html
pages for missing .js and .css files? These are completely useless, as
the user never sees them anyway, just slow everything down.

I know I can edit .htaccess and fix this, but I'm working on a plugin
that hit another bug/limitation in WordPress and was hoping to turn
these 404 pages off from whitin the plugin. Or perhaps I could file an
"enhancement" ticket on trac.wordpress.org.

You can modify the rewrite rules WordPress generates straight from a plugin.
Check the codex for a few different methods for doing so:

Hi Everyone,
I've been lurking on this list for a while now and just wanted to
introduce myself and project that I'm involved in. I'm a videoblogger
- a real video tech geek - who's been learning WordPress and web stuff
over the last few years. I've been working with a group of
videobloggers to put together a set of plugins, widgets and themes for
Wordpress to make it really do all the cool video stuff we dream about
having. We're calling it Show In A Box - http://showinabox.tv and
we're documenting our process at http://showinabox.pbwiki.com/

So I just wanted to let you all know what were up to and hope that
some of this stuff might be of use to the wider community.

HI, Tohru

I also use Gengo, and understand what your problems are. One solution
would be to change Gengo plugin as follows:

In your case, Gengo could actually call the wp_cache_add() function to
cache the locale-related page details, so that when the next visitor
comes with ja_JP locale, Gengo would be able to pull out the correct
pages.

This is not ideal because basically the pages got cached twice (first
in the wp_get_pages function and then in Gengo plugin). So, in the
long run, making the cache system locale aware is the best solution.

Best,

-Liang

Hi Liang, 
I'm grad to have a reply from you. :)

Well, actually plugins developers could solve problems relate to the
cache feature in their way, one by one. 
But should each developer face such problems?
Should each developer spend time to think and solve such problems?

That's, in other words, making plugins to have patches against the
core code.
It doesn't make a sense to me.

Making the core to be right will save the total of code lines and
total time of writing code belong to the WordPress.

> So, in the

Yes, it should be. :)

Where do the core developers go? I haven't gotten any words from them
about this. :p
# Also my plugin registration request haven't be approved over a month.
# Who has responsibility to do it? 
# I hate the way it goes. Only what I've had is silence.


BTW, Liang, 

> In your case, Gengo could actually call the wp_cache_add() function to

An another idea come to me.
Since the cache which get_pages() sets is associated with a page query
condition, injecting a locale related value into that query condition
makes the cache to be unique by each locale.

With WP2.21 and Gengo 0.9.1-alpha-4, the following works:

if (!function_exists('gengo_list_pages')) {
function gengo_list_pages($args = '') {
    if (is_array($args)) {
        $r = &$args;
    } else {
        parse_str($args, $r);
    }
    $r = array_merge(array('language' => the_language(true)), $r);
    return wp_list_pages($r);
}
}

However, there is a bug inside of get_pages(). So the first time
calling results good but the later callings result not.

I made a ticket about it. http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4660

The cache feature seems not tested well.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Modify get_pages() behavior trough filter
Message-ID: <000001c7cb9e$542bdae0$0a01a8c0@humanprofile>

Hi,

I'm trying to modify the behavior of the get_pages() function from a plugin.

I would like to add a child_of parameter to get_pages() when it is invoked
without the child_of or include parameters.

At the beginning I have tough I can solve this issue using a filter like the
following:

function get_pages_filter($result, $r) {
	if ((!isset($r['child_of']) || empty($r['child_of'])) &&
		(!isset($r['include']) || empty($r['include']))) {
		$r['child_of'] = 5; // this is just an example
		return get_pages($r);
	}
	return $result;
}

I have used the same code for get_categories and get_bookmarks filters and
they worked like a charm, but the get_pages() function behaves differently. 

After applying the get_pages filter, the $pages array is passed to the
get_page_children() function that "strips out" any page that hasn't the
right post_parent value.

The only solution I have been able to find is to add a new filter named
pre_get_pages at the beginning of the get_pages() function just before the
extract($r); command:

$r = apply_filters('pre_get_pages', $r);

In this way it's possible to manipulate the get_pages parameter before they
are used.

Following the same logic, it can be useful to add a post_get_pages filter at
the end of the get_pages() function (don't know if it has to be inserted
before or after the wp_cache_set() call):

$pages = apply_filters('post_get_pages', $pages, $r);

I will appreciate any any idea to avoid the modification of the get_pages()
code.

Sincerely,
Filippo Toso

Subject: [wp-hackers] 2.0 branch
Message-ID: <00f401c7cba2$6126ed30$4001a8c0@amd3500>

I've got a few questions/remarks about the 2.0 branch:

1. When will 2.0.11 be released? A couple of serious security bugs were
found and fixed and a couple of RC's were released, but that's been over 3
weeks [1] ago.

2. At the moment it looks like only security related patches get into the
2.0 branch. What's going to happen with all those 2.0.eventually tickets
[1]. Some of them have been around for 5 2.0 branch releases. We should
either commit them, or kill the milestone.

3. If it's true that only security fixes go into the 2.0 branch, how do we
handle non-security tickets [3] submitted by Debian? They are the main
reason we still support the 2.0 branch.

The above is not intended to step on anybodies toes, but I'd like to get
some discussion/policy making going on how we handle that branch. At the
moment it's kind of vague to me and I assume to others as well.

Bas Bosman (Nazgul)

Welp, the problems are pretty straightforward. Problem_s_, plural.

Serialize() makes a string out of the CURRENT STATE of an object.  
When we call serialize(array( &$plugin_obj, $func_name )) during  
add_filter(), we get the state of $plugin_obj *at that time*. If the  
state changes before remove_filter() is called, the result of  
serialize() will be different, and we'll leave the filter hooked in.

Additionally, $function_to_add is passed by reference into add_filter 
() and remove_filter(), each of which call serialize(). Serialize(),  
in turn, triggers __sleep() on the object on which it is run. While  
Post Teaser does not take advantage of __sleep()'s magical  
functionality, it's not unreasonable that some especially complex  
plugin might do so. Should that user helpfully pass in  
$function_to_add with a reference to her object, we'll be calling  
__sleep() on the original, live variable, not a copy. Given all this,  
WordPress randomly calling serialize() simply to make a string by  
which to index an object seems neither safe nor fair.

I was unable to reproduce problems with Post Teaser in my testing,  
but I'd guess that whatever issue this causes, it's subtle,  
intermittent and obscure. (Since we only fail when the object's state  
changes between a call to add_filter() and a call to remove_filter(),  
AND failing to remove a filter will only have an effect if the hook  
is yet to come, the execution path for a plugin where this happens is  
probably pretty wild. I'd imagine we'd see some sort of bizarre error  
from the plugin itself, as it was not expecting to have its filter  
function called. But WE HAVE NO IDEA what it will actually do.  
(Additionally, the changes as to how objects are handled in PHP4 vs  
PHP5 has bearing on this problem in several places, so it's also  
likely that the problem will manifest differently on each platform.)

In any case, one potential fix is very easy--replacing calls to  
serialize() with calls to get_class()--and thinking about it will  
illuminate why this strategy will fail unless we slightly change what  
we expect from a function that wishes to hook into a filter.

{{{
function add_filter($tag, $function_to_add, $priority = 10,  
$accepted_args = 1) {
	global $wp_filter;

	$fn_idx = (is_array($function_to_add) ? (get_class($function_to_add 
[0]) . $function_to_add[1]) : $function_to_add);

	$wp_filter[$tag][$priority][$fn_idx] = array('function' =>  
$function_to_add, 'accepted_args' => $accepted_args);
	return true;
}
}}}

Unfortunately, all is not well.

This will fail whenever a plugin instantiates more than one instance  
of one of its classes (they'll have the same name according to  
get_class() ), and attempts to register filters from two different  
objects--with different private data, presumably--under the same method.

The standard PHP distribution provides no way (I know of) for us to  
maintain the identity of an object *as a scalar* over time--which is  
what we need so it can be used as a key. All of the essential  
characteristics they have are the same (class, method names, property  
names) and all of their superficial characteristics could change over  
time. It's like that time that set of twins showed up to my party and  
swapped shirts while I was in the bathroom. We can tell they're not  
equal (by comparing them, and seeing, oh hay, there's two of them!)  
but we can't actually keep track of any given one as soon as he and/ 
or she leaves our sight. (Note that we have this problem with  
serialize() as well, as two instances of a class instantiated with  
the same values will yield the same serialized string, even though  
they are not strictly equal.)

The best way I can see to salvage the new filter framework (and keep  
our efficiency gains) is to make each twin give up some DNA for us to  
test. Erm, we need to force objects bearing filter functions to be  
able to identify themselves. PHP5 actually has a function intended  
for this built right in: __toString(). It's magically called whenever  
one would convert an object to a string, the intention being that it  
will return something that picks this object out uniquely (or I guess  
prints out "Hello World" like all the examples :P). (This is unlike  
serialize(), which saves its state irrespective of whether the  
original object persists). This makes it better than any other  
arbitrary method name, as it is not only unlikely to be used for some  
other purpose (similar to 'wp_plugin_obj_to_string' or somesuch), but  
it is, in fact, somewhat likely to be *already* used for *this*  
purpose as it is canonically intended to do what we're asking of it  
(even though the user's version of PHP may or may not care very much).

In the case where a plugin would want to register the same method  
name on two different instances of a class, she would be required to  
implement the method __toString() to uniquely identify that object  
for its duration, or suffer burny, intermittent death.

Note also that it's fine to register '__toString' as a method in  
PHP<5. It just lacks the magical functionality. The same goes for  
when __toString() isn't implemented by the user: casting an object to  
a string simply returns the helpful value of "Object". So as long as  
we don't rely on the magic (or the lack thereof) anywhere else--god  
forbid we have strval($obj) == "Object" somewhere--and we invoke it  
explicitly in add_filter() and remove_filter(), we're fine. Plugins  
that will not run into this problem in the first place--like the vast  
majority of them, as we're seeing now with the buggy serialize() code  
running live--have no need to make any changes. Of the few that do,  
the change is trivial.

One final note. You may be saying, "Dave, this is not a perfect  
solution. It requires action on the part of the plugin author to  
work. In fact, it is a somewhat messy solution." You would be right.

However, looking back on the old code, this problem still existed. / 
We can't solve this by rolling it back./ Technically, it was a form  
of the changing-state-in-serialize() problem, but nonetheless:

{{{
// This is a snippet from remove_filter(), starting on line 77 in the  
old plugins.php

foreach ( (array) $wp_filter[$tag]["$priority"] as $filter ) {
	if ( $filter['function'] != $function_to_remove )
		$new_function_list[] = $filter;
}}}

Given that $function_to_remove and $filter['function'] are both  
something like array( $object, $function_name ), the comparison will  
end up looping through all the properties of each object, and testing  
to see if their values are equal. If the function-tuple wasn't  
created by reference--and that is up to the plugin author: if her  
plugin is running in PHP4, she has to call $function_to_add = array( & 
$object, $function_name ) and not $function_to_add = array( $object,  
$function_name ) (but vice versa in PHP5!)--the properties of the  
object stored in $wp_filter will have different values than  
$function_to_remove if the state has changed. Slightly inverted from  
our first problem, but in both cases we're in trouble if the author  
doesn't have knowledge of how her object is going to be identified.

Given that rolling back the code doesn't fix the problem, I'm more  
fond of this solution. No, it's not perfect, but on the bright side,  
it does helpfully solve our problem by offloading it to the plugin  
author! And in this case, she is going to be a tiny, infinitesimal  
fraction of all plugin authors anyway--the plugin author who wants to  
make many instances of her objects and attach each one with the same  
method to the same filter. And really, all we're forcing her to do is  
read the documentation. ;) (We really *do* want to doc this, heh. If  
this goes into the trunk, I'll volunteer to write it up.)

So the final code is:

{{{
function add_filter($tag, $function_to_add, $priority = 10,  
$accepted_args = 1) {
	global $wp_filter;
	
	if(is_array($function_to_add)) {
		list($obj,$fn) = $function_to_add;
		$fn_idx = (method_exists($obj,'__toString') ? $obj->__toString() :  
'') . '[]' . get_class($obj) . '[]' . $fn;
	} else
		$fn_idx = $function_to_add;
	
	$wp_filter[$tag][$priority][$fn_idx] = array('function' =>  
$function_to_add, 'accepted_args' => $accepted_args);
	return true;
}

function remove_filter($tag, $function_to_remove, $priority = 10,  
$accepted_args = 1) {
	global $wp_filter, $merged_filters;

	if(is_array($function_to_remove)) {
		list($obj,$fn) = $function_to_remove;
		$fn_idx = (method_exists($obj,'__toString') ? $obj->__toString() :  
'') . '[]' . get_class($obj) . '[]' . $fn;
	} else
		$fn_idx = $function_to_add;

	unset($GLOBALS['wp_filter'][$tag][$priority][$fn_idx]);
	unset( $merged_filters[ $tag ] );

	return true;
}
}}}



ps. I'm sure I violated some sort of style guide or something in this  
message, but I poked around Trac and couldn't find anything. I  
apologize in advance.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <007201c7cbd8$37b60a40$6501a8c0@homey>

Hello.  I am developing a web site that will have a wp blog as part of its
content.  I would like to arrange things so that there is just one
registration/login for the whole site-i.e. so that once you're registered or
logged-in for the site you are registered or logged-in to make comments on
the wp blog too.  Can anyone give me advice for doing this and/or point me
to relevant links?  I'm not having too much luck googling around on it.  Is
it just a matter of making an entry in wp_users to register, and setting a
cookie for login?

 

TIA..

 

Steve

There are a number of ways that you can do this.  How you implement your
solution really depends upon how many different systems (blog, forum,
support system etc) you are implementing.  In any case, you probably want to
take a look at the wp-includes\pluggable.php file.

Overloading functions like wp_get_cookie_login(), get_cookie_username(),
auth_redirect() will get you a long way to your goal if you want WP to use
an existing cookie.  If you are feeding logins the other direction, you
might need to look at other functions like wp_login().  That might help feed
the information to the cookie the other system is using.

In any case, take a look at what they do and you can create a file that goes
into your plugin directory with replacement functions with the same name
doing things the way you want to do them.


BTW There is a good chance this line will confuse you:
      if ( ($already_md5 && md5($login->user_pass) == $password) ||
($login->user_login ==$username && $login->user_pass == md5($password)) ) {
         return true;

The "already_md5" doesn't apply to $login->user_pass.  It applies to
$password.  YMMV, but I had to twist that line to do what I needed to do.
BTW WPMU is missing the comment explaining this line.  :) Enjoy!

Message-ID: <000001c7cc29$c4d81750$486aa74c@hal9001>

When the apply_filters hook has 2 variables how 
do you change the second variable in a plugin?

For example:
apply_filter ('get_categories', $categories, $r);

I know what to do for one variable.  Create a function
with the specified variable as an argument and in the
return statement.  Call add_filter.

For example:
function test_function ($test)  {
  $test =  .......
  return $test;
}
add_filter ('hook', 'test_function');

Any help is appreciated.

add_filter( 'filter_name', 'test_function', 10, 2);

The last argument in add_filter is the magic -- it's how many arguments your
function is set up to receive. The 10 is just the default for priority.

I want to CHANGE the second variable.   In my corrected example
you return the first variable.   What do I specify as the return state-
ment?

A few simple questions.   Does the added filter function get inserted
at the apply_ filters statement?   Do the variables get changed at
the apply_filters statement and not before or after?   A function can
only be removed if a do_action is inserted in the function?  Finally
a function with do_action inserted can be processed first with low
priority with a user function and the primary function will not execute?

Beg my indulgence, I hope that is not too many questions but there is
no specific documentation in Codex except add_action and add_filter.

that's when it's run; it is added to the filter list when you run add_filter

yup

this is confusing, please rephrase

this is again confusing, you need to define what you want to know better :P

Message-ID: <b76f24970707220326s136e81d9sfeb16600742367c6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working on a customization of administration interface.  There
are a few themes around already, and I've seen them all.  IMHO, Tiger
does the best job - clean, easy, and a really fresh look.  I'm using
it as a reference.

One of the problems on the way is styling the admin menu items.  The
list has the adminmenu class assigned to it, but it's not enough.
Tiger, for example, introduces unique icons for each main menu item,
which is very cool.  But currently it does it with a hack.  Icons are
attached to consequitive list items (item 1, item 2, item 3, etc).
This, of course, breaks horribly if main menu items are hidden or
rearranged.

I think it would be nice to have a unique ID set on each menu item, so
that a style could be attached to it.  The ID can be dynamically
generated from the item title or something like that.

For example,

<li id="menu_dashboard"><a href="">Dashboard</a></li>
<li id="menu_manage"><a href="">Manage</a></li>
<li id="menu_blogroll"><a href="">Links</a></li> ;)

I think the patch would be trivial too.

Thoughts?

 Any Wordpress  function can be removed by a remove_filter 
using a hook in a plugin only if a do_action hook statement is 
inserted in the Wordpress function?

Any Wordpress function with a do_action hook statement inserted 
will be processed first by specifying a high priority (10 being low 
and 1 being high) in an add_filter statement in a plugin?  In this 
case the function added by add_filter will execute and the Wordpress 
function will not execute or not execute unless removed by remove_filter.

Hi,

> When the apply_filters hook has 2 variables how 
> do you change the second variable in a plugin?

I think you have no chance while you do not change hook source's code.

Or, you can do but there's a limitation.

Here's a sample code.

--- [wordpress/test.php] ---
require './wp-config.php';

add_filter('test-me', 'earlier_filter',    9, 2);
add_filter('test-me', 'change_2nd_value', 10, 3);
add_filter('test-me', 'later_filter',     11, 2);

function earlier_filter($first, $second)
{
    printf("%-20s[in]: %-16s, %s\n", __FUNCTION__, $first, $second);
    return 'earlier';
}

function change_2nd_value($first, $second, $second_array)
{
    printf("%-20s[in]: %-16s, %s\n", __FUNCTION__, $first, $second);
    $second_array[0] = 'world';
    return 'change_2nd_value';
}

function later_filter($first, $second)
{
    printf("%-20s[in]: %-16s, %s\n", __FUNCTION__, $first, $second);
    return 'later';
}

$second = 'second';
$first = apply_filters('test-me', 'first', &$second, array(&$second));

printf("%-20s    : %-16s, %s\n", 'result', $first, $second);

---[end]---

---[RESULT]---
earlier_filter      [in]: first           , second
change_2nd_value    [in]: earlier         , second
later_filter        [in]: change_2nd_value, second
result                  : later           , world
---[end]---

As you see, the second argument of hook source's variable is modified after
calling filters but not among filters. It's the limitation I mentioned
above.

Oops, I sent code still working but over modificat... how do I say in
English?
Well, I sent one of testing code I wrote but there included no mean reference.

> $first = apply_filters('test-me', 'first', &$second, array(&$second));

the reference `&$second' does not work. So it's good still like:

> $first = apply_filters('test-me', 'first', $second, array(&$second));


Sigh...


In addition, the modification required to a hook source will be like
this:

   apply_filters ('get_categories', $categories, $r);
to apply_filters ('get_categories', $categories, $r, array(&$r));

then a filter you'll write:
   add_filter ('get_categories', 'my_handler', 10, 2);
   function my_handler($cats, $r)
to add_filter ('get_categories', 'my_handler', 10, 3);
   function my_handler($cats, $r, $r_array)
   {
     $r_array[0][..] = ...

Okay, so you've got something like this:
$categories = apply_filters('get_categories', $categories, $r);
And you want to not only return something for categories, but also
change the value of $r?


Short answer: You can't do that.


Long answer: You can't do that without changing the apply_filter()
call itself. You would need to pass an array containing the reference
to the variable. The array is passed by value, but the reference can
be used to alter what you want to alter.

Also, as FUJINAKA Tohru points out, if you also pass the same thing by
value, then that value won't be recognized as changed until you return
from all the filters, because the value has already been passed,
you're not changing the passed value, you're changing the original
value (via the reference).

I'm fine with that, but it'd need to be done in a way that translation 
doesn't mess it up.

I would like to go the other way. I wish we could have all our links
delisted by default. It's way out of date. You only need to consider the
mess of horizontal menus to realise that lists should not be used for links.
The markup is far too top heavy, it is inconsistent across platform and a
nightmare to style. And dont get me started on drop down menus. Give us
plain links please. :)

What about when you use the default search widget that it checks if you have a searchform.php and if so uses that, but if not
it defaults to what's in widgets.php?

Message-ID: <6ea8ed0f0707260600l6b25d620p7f03551d814f9b13@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm attempting to display post attachments depending on the
attachment's mime type, name, size, etc and am not sure if this is
possible without using a plugin. I see the functions discussed at
http://mdawaffe.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/hitting-wordpress-attachment-handling/,
but without studying each function's references a great deal, I'm not
sure how to use these. They do appear to be available within a theme.
My searching on the codex didn't yield anything on these either - I
may just be missing it.

Is there something out there about doing this sort of thing? Is a
plugin necessary? The author of this plugin,
http://blog.designdelineations.com/2006/05/17/wordpress-plugin-autolink-attachment/,
seems to indicate that v2.1 includes the functionality that plugin
provided, I just can't find it.

Thanks,
Tom

What would be the point? All the search widget does is to output a
simple form. If you want to style it, use CSS.

If, for whatever wacky reason, you absolutely must have custom HTML
for your search form, then just use a Text Widget instead and build
your search form in there.

No, it's just that your code is wrong.

You're getting the posts into the $news array, and then you're
foreach'ing through them, setting each one to $post. What you're
missing is that just having the post inside $post doesn't make all the
template tags like get_permalink and the_title and such automagically
use them.

Add a call to setup_postdata($post) at the beginning of the foreach
loop. This will setup all the template tags correctly.

foreach($news as $post):

a> <small>(".get_the_time('d/m',false).")</small>"

Why go to that much trouble? All the search widget does is output some
simple HTML. A text widget does the same thing except it lets you
change the HTML. Making your own custom widget seems rather extreme.

I was looking for sample code for  this kind of thing too, and also  
coming up short. Take  a look at this plugin:

http://reidab.com/2006/10/attachment-list-plugin/

It  seems to  be  doing an OK  job  of getting at some of the  
attachment info  without using the new hooks - just  by querying.  
It's pretty simple  and  you might be  able  to  modify it to  do  
what  you  need, or use it  as an example (though it would be nicer   
to use the API of course).

I read the below post last week before I left for a small vacation, and
I really hoped it would raise some discussion. I agree with Bas that
those are very important issues for all people who need and apprechiate
WP 2.0.x as a "stable" distribution. (For example, I use only 2.0.x for
myself and for customer projects, as I couldn't guarantee consistency
accross upgrades with the later series.)

I just chatted with him on the dev channel and we're thinking about
shooting for Wednesday.  We'll work out the details once he gets
settled in at home.  Most of the devs have been traveling the past
couple weeks for WordCamp and after-WordCamp vacations.   We've had a
very poor earthquake factor the past couple weeks. ;-)

Once everyone gets home we can get momentum going again on 2.0.x and 2.3.

In what way? If that were the case, that would suggest something is

Mostly because of plugins, which may break or malfunction with upgrades.
But also because of changing core functions used in plugins and themes.
If I install WordPress for somebody, I do not want to fix broken
features on every release. I want to have a perspective of some years
with the least amount of internal changes.

Well there is clearly is something wrong with the upgrading philosophy. WP
depends in large part on the goodwill of plugin and theme developers. The
upgrade model takes no cognisance of either community. Most commercial devs
need to stick with older versions. They can not afford the stress or the
financial cost of re inventing the wheel every time they do an install.

Is sanitize_title() translation friendly?  Attached is a simple patch
for wp-admin/menu-header.php (against trunk r5820) which generates
ID's like 'adminmenu_dashboard' and 'submenu_posts'.

Any problems with this approach? It seem to work for me.

It would be nice to have a few more hooks for admin menu output,
indeed.   Easier way to control the menus and submenus is needed (or
do I need to read more of Codex?).

This would be a great help for my drop down menus plugin as well  
which currently has to repeat some of the routines from core and is  
VERY top heavy. Some way of taking over the menu construction earlier  
would be great.

WordPress most definitely depends on the goodwill of plugin and theme
developers. Open source, open bug tracking, open development, this is
fundamental.

WordPress code continues to mature with the diverse participation of
the development community. I would rather have a forward moving
WordPress, than a backwards compatible one.

WordPress now has a known release cycle.  2.3 is scheduled for
September 20, 2007
http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/  In the weeks before, don't leave
it to someone else to make sure that your favorite plugins work well.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins has been a awesome step forward,
and I look forward to how update notification and additional features
can improve the quality of the experience.

Cheers,

You said it yourself. "for the first time", most people that use
WordPress, most of the time don't seem to want to add cats to pages.

I agree with Lloyd, I can't see many people taking advantage of this.

When 2.3 is released a plugin adding categories to pages wouldn't be hard at
all thanks to the new taxonomy system. If you don't like the current plugin
out there just sit tight and I'm sure something else will be developed.

Hi,
Not claiming that I am a standard WP user, or "most people", but I use 
page categories! Since my website is now totally integrated with WP, it 
shows menus that go to static page content, then with relevant posts 
underneath - this is done via the page-category-organiser plugin 
(modified a bit I admit) and tweaks to template pages to do this - it 
works well!

I think this is useful as it allows Wordpress functionality (multiple 
admin/editors, and a login for "Club members only" menu pages and 
content, etc etc), whilst presenting as a "standard" web site rather 
than a pure blog.
the site is for a sailing club in the UK , and is at  
http://www.budworthsc.org.uk if you want to have a look - hopefully the 
above will then make sense!

Best Regards
Chris
P.S. So not keen to change the whole design to WP 2.3 when it comes out!

Corey Shaffer is actually working on this as part of the WP GSOC CMS
project too.

So, it is coming.

I agree with Lloyd, I can't see many people taking advantage of this.

When 2.3 is released a plugin adding categories to pages wouldn't be
hard at
all thanks to the new taxonomy system. If you don't like the current
plugin
out there just sit tight and I'm sure something else will be developed.

I'm trying to do something similar with Category Page plugin, which  
I'm currently debugging (with some troubles). It bind a page to a  
category, and ships with modified template file (for the default  
theme) to explain how to use it, but I'm also writing a widget,  
hoping to finish it tomorrow :-)

I was able to make it work for 2.1.3, 2.2.1 and svn at this time,  
checking for compatibility with other releases.  It has some strange  
bugs, and I'm not using it in production actually but I'll do soon,  
just to test it.

You can find it (and if you like help me as well ;-) at

<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page2cat/>

comments and feedback are also welcome to its official page:

<http://pixline.net/wordpress-plugins/category-page-plugin/>

I hope it can help you :-)

While it's pretty cool, I'd like it better if it actually got Google
results instead of Yahoo's.

Google offers their results via javascript if you use their AJAX
search API: http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/

Or, if you want a quick and easy way, Google also operates
searchmash.com as a beta testing site for interface stuff. Its results
can be easily nabbed in a json format:
http://www.searchmash.com/results/[query]

You can specify that you only want the first result of the query like so:
http://www.searchmash.com/results/[query]?n=1

The json returned to you is pretty easy to figure out.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Per Post comment feed...feature or accident?
Message-ID: <20070731124129.GA28481@gerf.org>

I read someone's wordpress blog and posted a comment and I thought to
my self, "gee, it'd be nice if I could just subscribe to the comments
for *this* post..." 

I putzed around for a while and discovered that if I added "/feed" to
the end of the post's URL it would return comments ONLY for that post!

Is this a feature or an accident of design?  I ask because there is no
advertising of this URL.  If it is a feature, then someone should add
the RSS links to the header and possibly to the sidebars...

If it is a happy accident, can we make it official and add the links?

Ciao!

Its a feature, It really depends on the theme if its shown though.
The same goes for category and tag pages, append /feed/ to nearly any WP
page and you'll get a feed for changes on that page.

Message-ID: <Pine.BSF.4.64.0707311014150.30057@www.provisio.net>

Hi all,

wp-includes/classes.php around line 292 has this:

     $this->query_posts();
     $this->handle_404();

My Category Access plugin filters out posts for which the user does not
have permissions. When using a permalink to the post, this causes
$wp_query->posts to be empty, which in turn causes handle_404 to print a
404.

My question is this: Is there some way to get WP to redirect to the login
screen in this case instead of showing a 404 message?

Thanks,
David

The default and classic themes both show the Comments RSS feed links
in the page footers. Those are for the whole site though.

The default theme also shows this on single pages: You can follow any
responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.

While the classic theme shows this: RSS feed for comments on this post.

Both of which contain links to the feeds. So, if your theme was doing
the right thing, you'd have that link.

I use the following code in my theme's header to add the
automatic-browser feed links:

<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="<?php
bloginfo('name'); ?> RSS Feed" href="<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?>"
/>
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="<?php
bloginfo('name'); ?> RSS Comments Feed" href="<?php
bloginfo('comments_rss2_url'); ?>" />
<?php if (is_single()) { ?>
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="<?php
the_title(); ?> RSS Comments Feed" href="<?php echo comments_rss();
?>" />
<?php } ?>

This lets the browser see the main feed, the whole-blog comments feed,
and the single page comments feed if you're looking at a single page.

You can do similar things to add links specifically for category
pages, author pages, etc. Look at these functions:
get_author_rss_link, get_category_rss_link.

>Cool!

This is very helpful when adding your blog to "lists" and dedicated pages.
You can give that side a feed that is specific to their site and that
increases the likelihood that your blog will be accepted and decreases the
pollution of that site.  For example the site DelphiFeeds.com would only
want to see posts in the Delphi category.  Actually I'm on there with my
Borland feed which includes Delphi and all subcategories below it.

It's a wonderful WordPress feature.

Brian.

I'd like to take a look at the code you are using for the Amazon S3 feature,
if it's possible ;)

Fascinating that we had similar solution. However, from what I have 
seen, your solution would only half work.

The magic method __toString(), which could be anything by the way you 
call it, would only print out what was in the __toString() only with 
echo or print, before 5.2. It seems like the most logical choice, since 
if they are using PHP 4, then it would just call the method and pull 
down the result. Very nice. For your example to work, they would have to 
use a static member which they increment each time __toString() is 
called. Not difficult. This documentation would have to be added for 
plugin developers. This only directly affects those who use classes.

The value in __toString() would have to change. However, the current 
code would only need to be changed like so.

$fn_idx = (method_exists($obj,'__toString') ? $obj->__toString() :  '') 
. '[]' . get_class($obj) . '[]' . $fn;
}}}

I'm not sure this would work correctly.

For array('class_name', 'method_name') :

$fn_idx would equal: '[][]method_name'

For array($this, 'methodname') : ($this (myClass) having __toString that 
return 'object')

$fn_idx would equal: 'object[]myClass[]methodname'

Another For array($this, 'methodname') with same as above:

$fn_idx would equal: 'object[]myClass[]methodname'

It solves nothing if casted as a string when added to the array key 
value. From my experience, casting it as an array would very well give 
an error. You appear to be better developer than I. If you can solve 
this, then let me know because the only way I was able to get around 
this was casting as a string.

'''Inheritance'''

If a plugin developer wises to add the same class, why don't they just 
inherit their class and use that instead?

{{{
class Foobar {
    var $name;
    
    function Foobar( $name ){
        $this->name = $name;
    }
    
    function hook( $v ) {
        return $this->name . " Hooked! $v";
    }
}

class Barbar extends Foobar { }

$foo1 = new Foobar("baz");
$foo2 = new Barbar("quux");

create_filter( 'the_content', array( &$foo1, "hook" ) );
create_filter( 'the_content', array( &$foo2, "hook" ) );
}}}

As much work as they would have to do to comply with the new standards, 
it would be just as easy to extend their or another's class with a new name.

{{{
$wp_filter[$tag][$priority][serialize($serialized)][] = //...
}}}

Enghh. I didn't know that. I'll look into it.

Also Enghh. Apparently I didn't read the callback pseudotype  
documentation closely, because I didn't realize you could pass a  
string representing a class name to grab a static method. Alright, I  
will look into these issues (and the others you brought up) later  
tonight.

I forgot to mention, that with your code, nothing changes. You don't use 
__toString() magically, you call it as a regular method. It should work 
with any PHP 4 and PHP 5 version. If you tried to do something like

$fn_idx = $obj . '[]' . get_class($obj) . '[]' . $fn;

instead of what you did, then you would have possible problems with PHP 
versions < 5.2.

$fn_idx = (method_exists($obj,'__toString') ? $obj->__toString() :  
'') . '[]' . get_class($obj) . '[]' . $fn;

So, it is great. However, if the developer then suspected that they can 
use their class name in messages and such, it could cause issues, unless 
this was made clear. I would almost rather it be called something else.

I didn't explain myself that well. The method doesn't have to be static, 
for PHP 4 and 5, it will just treat it as static, meaning no $this 
usage. I don't believe many developers will use this method, unless they 
are adding the hooks outside of their class (and even then, from the 
example they use the constructor, which wouldn't mean static). From what 
I've seen, most choose to add hooks from inside and using $this or if 
outside, with the constructor. So no static usage. However, it would be 
better to use defensive programming to keep from any possible future 
bugs from occurring.

It is a possible use case and I'm glad you are examining it.

The greater problem is the inability to remove classes. So the ability 
to remove classes should hold great priority than to be able to add two 
classes with the same names but with different values. The values can 
change at any point...

I suppose then that the solution would mean that you reference the 
object in the array when you are adding it. You would then have to 
iterate through the same class and method names and do a class 
comparsion on each one. Since you reference the class, when the 
properties of that class are changed, then (in theory) the properties in 
the $wp_filters array would change also. The serialization can not do 
that (or so I think).

It would be slower, but would provide a solution that wouldn't require 
any modification to any existing and further code. I will see about 
providing a patch and use cases.

1) I think I also not allowed to use S/MIME. :-(
2) I already sent a mail on 9 of August. The Problem is that all files
in the tag-folder are packed in a folder with the <plugin-name>.  Before
they were packed into the folder "wp-content/plugins". My folder in the
svn is post-notification. In my tag folderI have a folder called
post_notification with all the files. With the old packing script this
was great, as all my files went into the folder
/wp-content/plugins/post_notification. Now the files are in the folder
"post-notification/post_notification". When people copy the toplevel
folder in the zip into their wp plugin folder the plugin doesn't work,
as the files are one level too deep. Also I have quite a few files, as
my plugin includes over 1000 lines of code - and some more HTML. People
also quite often mix up the post-notification and post_notification
(underline!) so the includes are not found. All I really want is the
script which was running on the server before. I'm even willing to
donate code (adjust the script).
Besides that I think the screen shots should be excluded as they make
the file bigger as necessary.

Morty

Use Cases (What I expect and not what happens, I will need to do unit 
testing for that part):

The below two will create an additional property on the class to keep 
track of the of the unique id for removal and insertion. This depends on 
the code being accurate, in the handling of the $function_to_add array. 
I tried to reference the array, but I'm starting to think that I should 
have the '&' in the function instead to make it easier.

For array($this, 'method_name'):

Quote (http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.references.spot.php):
    "In an object method, $this is always a reference to the caller object."

On PHP 4: Should give desired result because it is being passed by 
reference anyway.
On PHP 5: Should work as expected..

For array(&$this, 'method_name'):

The redundancy is from some reason for PHP 4, is lost to me, as I didn't 
bother to learn class references until PHP 5 when it was no longer a 
requirement for classes.

See above. This should be the preferred method, since it won't hurt and 
won't break on wrong information in manual or some PHP 4 bug. For the 
documentation page.

For array($object, 'method_name');

For PHP 4: Bug on plugin author's part and won't give desired result. It 
will create additional copies and won't delete the original. This could 
be fixed, but I'm not up for that now. There is a possible way to fix 
this, but it would require unit testing to be sure. It should also be 
faster, since it wouldn't be creating copies. The fix would only be for 
this use case though and I'm not sure it if it worth fixing a bug on the 
plugin author's fault.

For PHP 5: Should work as expected.

For array(&$object, 'method_name'):

For PHP 4: Should work as expected.
For PHP 5: Should work as expected.

For array('class_name', 'method_name'):

Perhaps the second fastest, just by how much workload and checking is 
done. We don't bother with the checking that the above four do, which 
will append a number to the classname and method name when the objects 
are different.

This is not needed for static method calling as it doesn't and won't 
depend on $this. It would be a bug on the part of the plugin author if 
they expect to be able to use $this in their method afterwards. I don't 
expect this to be used often enough, but it should still be supported.

For regular function passing:

Would work as expected and should only be slightly slower than what it 
is now.

However, only unit testing, code coverage, and profiling will give the 
complete and accurate picture. The use cases can easily be made into 
tests for running the current code and future code against.

for #2 maybe a code-change might be useful:
if in tag folder there is a single directory:
	include that directory in the base of the zip
else if multiple files/folders exist
	wrap files in that directory into a new folder(based on the slug of the  
plugin) and put that folder as the root of the zip

I dont think its right to have "/wp-content/plugins/" in the zip file  
myself, theres too many nested layers of folders.
But the number of people who develop with svn:/trunk/plugin-name/ and  
svn:/tags/1.5/plugin-name/ would be in the few, most people would be  
putting their files straght into svn:/trunk/ or svn:/tags/1.5/

Excluding the screenshots would get a +1 from me too.

I've been writing Wp-Update as part of Google Summer of Code, it includes  
an automatic plugin/theme installer, it takes files straight from  
wordpress.org, So that above psuedocode would be useful to ensure that the  
zip files are in a common format too..
