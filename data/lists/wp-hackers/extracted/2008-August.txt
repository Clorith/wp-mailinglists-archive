Hello,
 Do you know a way to enable wordpress to use complex search forms? I need
combo boxes (drop down), and check boxes only in this form. How would I pass
all the variables to the algorithm and store the data in the DB? It seems
the only search possible is the in site google kind of search, with one open
text field only. I have seasrched the web extensively but could not find
anything.

What do you want to search for -- what are all the drop-downs and 
check boxes used for? If they are standard WordPress things like 
categories, tags, post IDs, etc., you can probably just use 
WordPress's standard querying mechanism. For instance, if you set up 
your search form so that it will send the GET request:
    (your blog URL)?cat=1&s=software
it will search for all the posts containing the word "software" in the 
category whose ID is 1. This makes use of the WordPress query variable 
"cat" (category ID) as well as "s" (search term).

You can find out what the standard WordPress query variables are by 
looking at the top of wp-includes->classes.php, at the 
WP->public_query_vars variable definition... though it may not be 
obvious what all of them are. I'm not aware of any documentation on 
their meanings, but you can look at WordPress URLs (with permalinks 
turned off) to get ideas.

If you are searching for things other than what WordPress has in its 
query variables, you will probably need to write a plugin to do the 
querying behind your search box. There are some examples of how to do 
this here:
     http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Queries

Good luck!

Hey all,

When browsing the Plugin Directory on wordpress.org, plugins can be 
browsed by any of several "Popular Tags".  Does anyone know how the 
actual Tag listings are generated?  (e.g. 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/post )  Is there a freely 
available plugin that generates these pages?

Thanks! :)

Message-ID: <74b84aa30808011317m3a731138vaba2023cc9189dd4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi -

I wrote a simple and tiny plugin to enclose all existing (and future)
capitalized words within abbr tags, so I could style it to, say, small
caps---for typographical effect. (
http://ckunte.com/archives/small-caps ) Pl. see below:

function ckunte_smallcaps($text) {
        $search = "/\b([A-Z]{1,})\b/";
        $replace = "<abbr>$1</abbr>";
        $text = preg_replace($search,$replace,$text);
        return $text;
}
if (function_exists('add_filter')) {
        add_filter('the_content', 'ckunte_smallcaps');
}


I have a couple of questions in this regard:

1. Is the filter applied in the feed as well? (I'd like to see it, if possible.)

2. Does the blog take a performance hit when you add_filter to
the_content, i.e., is this the best way of implementing it?

3. What is the simplest way of adding a custom CSS call to the <head>
section, say, a styling to abbr, so the user need not have to add
styling to every theme activated?

Would be grateful for your help.

Thank you,

PS: Writing Small caps was an inspiration from Textpattern's (Textile)
nice rendering of small caps.

This not authoritative, but considering that these folk use Wordpress  
a lot, it's quite possible it works just like http://wordpress.com/ 
tag/politics/ does.

Neat! :)

This is probably the best way to do it.  The other option is pretty  
much to alter the actual content as it's saved to the DB.  Stick with  
a filter so it can be undone.

add_action( 'wp_head', 'myplugin_wp_head' );

function myplugin_wp_head () {
	echo "\n<style type=\"text/css\">abbr{color:mauve;}</style>\n";
}

Pretty simple. ;-)

Stephen

I don't believe the Plugin Directory is WordPress powered.

But there are functions for outputting a tag cloud ->

No, They're bbPress powered :)

By "Generate these pages" what do you mean exactly? The tagged pages are  
generated easily enough by both bbPress/WordPress, If you mean the popular  
tags listing, then possibly the get_tags() function combined with ordering  
descending as well as a loop in php to generate the actual list...

So... we use wp_schedule_event() to add an event to WP's pseudo-cron  
system.

How do I _remove_ that addition -- say, on plugin deactivation?

I'm working on a plugin that will allow users to schedule its  
function, or not, and to customize the schedule....

There's another filter, "the_content_rss" that does that.

Actually last I looked "the_content" affects both the blog and feeds.

Well, looking at the feed generating files, they call the 
"the_content_rss" template tag, which only filters through the 
"the_content_rss" filter. They both call get_the_content() to grab their 
content, but it doesn't apply any fitlers.

Viper is right though, the_content filters both.

Is it possible a new feature in Wordpress for multi language blog?
An article will be translate from my language to another one by me (not
automatic translator, they are too bad).
This could be permalink friendly and search feature could be work.
I tested some plugin, but they have some problems: search function does
not work, no permalink friendly, too complexity, ...

This is refer of a previous discussion about this topic:
http://www.mail-archive.com/wp-testers@lists.automattic.com/msg07957.html

What do you all think about?

Thank you

Well, actually I am using Language Switcher from poplarware
http://www.poplarware.com/languageplugin.html and it is quite easy to set up
in a multi language format. It prompts a user translation just as you point
out and it does not clash with anything else I have installed on WP. There
is some time to be spent setting up the po files to internationalize your
custom templates, but if you have a wordpress-tailored theme then it's a
very quick process.

I used this plugin but for every new version of wordpress I need to edit manually the code of CMS. It is to complex.

That is because WordPress is not willing to make the Taxonomy table have 
a wide enough field for category and tag names. The default field is not 
big enough to hold multi-lingual names.  See
     http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3729
Maybe if enough of us comment that we'd like to see this fixed, it would 
be, but until then Language Switcher will require you to edit your 
schema.php file to make the term name field wider.

Anyway, that aside, I was going to mention that besides my Language 
Switcher plugin (which was based on one called Polyglot, which I think 
is still available), there is also Gengo. As far as I know, those are 
the two main multi-lingual plugins of the sort the original poster was 
looking for (where you write your own content in multiple languages).

I think that Gengo and Language Switcher use rather different 
philosophies, so if you don't like one, you might find the other works well.

Regards,
     Jennifer

For WP-powered multilingual sites, I found that in the end, my best/ 
easiest bet was actually... WordPress MU!

I create a blog for each language, and have the top level as a  
language switch (or more elaborate).

Live EG:
- http://meca.ca/site/
- http://meca.ca/site/en/
- http://meca.ca/site/fr/

Plus, with a simple custom plugin, you can define that if a page  
doesn't exist in one language, to redirect to what you had defined as  
the default language (say, English).

Multilanguage wil (probably) never be part of WordPress core, the devs  
said many times, because "it can be done with plugins".

I'm actually trying to bring on a noteworthy multilanguage plugin  
called Gengo, with the community we already made it working with  
WordPress 2.5+, and we're in the middle of the transition to a full  
community-driven project. I've somewhat fixed it for 2.5, and it works  
in 2.6. We're trying to make it WPMU compatibile, also.

You can download it from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gengo/

Also I would like to invite devs and hackers to join our effort and  
help us make this plugin a real community project. I started to fix  
it, but I did not supposed to be the only coder/mantainer for it, and  
now I'm too running out of time. I'm also going to open a mailing list  
soon and to revamp the website, just waiting for some free hours to do  
so..

I feel it a great plugin, and I use it proudly in my work projects,  
but the plugin needs more community feedback, more debug, even patches  
and codes if you can :-)

I'm noticing that several wordpress 2.5.1 and 2.6 blogs don't have the
ajax when you add/update/delete a custom field on pages although it
appears to be working on posts. Any particular reason why? This would
be a HUGE time saver not to have a page refresh when adding a dozen
custom fields!

Thanks in advance.

Because i dont have time to open a Trac ticket, Some thoughts:
  * Yes, Pages do not appear to have Ajaxification on the custom fields
  * The /wp-admin/js/custom-fields.js appears to be no longer used by  
anything
  * Adding a Custom field to a non-saved post(draft) results in empty post  
meta items added to the list, Attempting to modify these results in "An  
unidentified error has occurred."
  * Attempting to add a custom field to a published post on my test install

Why can't you use the drop-down arrow on the legit messages, select
Delete Message, then report the conversation as spam?

Thank you all for your fantastic job.
I tried gengo and its not easy to manage. This plug-in has problem with
search function and some others (see
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/191811 )
So I'm using Qtranslate but does not translate permalink. :(
Someone had fixed this problem of Qtranslate?

We are currently refactoring the Gengo plugin since it is too  
complicated and does not work out of the box in Wordpress 2.6.
Currently we are in a phase that we can test some functionality in  
combination with other plugins and I must admit the tests are going  
well.

We can translate pages, posts, permalinks and stuff very easy, and  
have an language switcher widget that works.

Paolo,

We have been mailing with the Gengo developer to ask him to  
participate in his project but he was not very willing.  So we decided  
to make a fork of his project and clean up things and stuff.  I'll  
keep the list informed when we have something that can be tested in  
beta.

I hope you're talking about template tweaks, because everything else  
is supposed to work, except bugs of course :-)

Goods for you, really! Can you please point me to some url in order to  
learn more?

I know, that's why I almost forked Gengo by myself last winter, but  
merged back with the main trunk in 2008, because I was lucky to gain  
attention from Jamie. But now I'm acting as maintainer, I'm trying to  
get it back working, because there are many websites is running it,  
and many of them are still stuck at 2.2 or worse.

Speaking by myself, I'm open to every kind of collaboration, because I  
think the point here is to have a working multilanguage plugin, and  
not to have plenty of half-working ones.

Maybe we can talk about this off-list, if you like.

Cheers,
Paolo

About multilingual wordpress,

I made a plugin specifically to provide authors to translate their blogs
in as many languages as they want.

You can translate everything in : tags / categories / posts / pages

It's called ZdMultilang and available on Wordpress extend, or on my
blog.

There are probably some things that need corrections, and I'm publishing
and making improvements quickly

Hi all,

I'd appreciate some help:

I want to tie a custom meta box to the file uploader, and don't know  
how. So, I'd like for someone to click on an icon in the meta box,  
with that, open the uploader, upload a file (to the normal upload  
directories), and sent back the url to the meta box input... This to  
tie images to a post that need to be used outside of the post in the  
theme...

Someone know how to do that? :)

Best,
Joost

No, but please share if you do get it working. =)

We make our editors copy and paste the url themselves into a meta field.

That's good news! I have also tried to modify it so that it works with
sub-language scripts (like pt_BR, zh_CN or similar), but Jamie is not
willing to make it work, thinking the language alone suffices, and
that's why I abandoned the idea of adopting Gengo at that time.
Perhaps time to take a fresh look again.

We are extremely in need of people like you, because I'm actually

I was wondering if after the various js scripts are printed to <head>
there is an array of them that I can acces later in the page.

I'm trying to load jQuery and other scripts only if needed (hence I
can't use wp_enqueue_script) and I don't want to load it if it is

Take a look at the wp_enqueue_scripts and wp_print_scripts functions. 
Basically, the list of scripts to be printed is maintained in the global 
variable $wp_scripts. You can probably figure out what those functions 
do, and do something similar to figure out if the script of interest to 
you has been queued previously. Files to look at (in wp-includes): 
class.wp-scripts.php, class.wp-dependencies.php, functions.wp-scripts.php.

However, you really need to get the script into the HTML header if you 
want it to work right in all browsers, so this probably won't help you 
much....

Good luck,
     Jennifer

Message-ID: <B2531351-6056-41D1-8764-B964DBBA6679@shaneandpeter.com>

Hey folks,

As part of a project we are having to enable a grip of widgets to work  
in multiple sidebars. Some of you will probably be receiving emails  
from us about the plug-in / widgets you have build being multi'd to  
see if you want to add in our retrofit.

I was wondering if anyone has gone to the effort of enabling the  
default wordpress widgets for multiple sidebars? If so, can we use  
that code?

if not, we'd be happy to contribute it towards the 2.7 release.

Thanks,

-S

Err.. what? Any multi-widget can be in multiple sidebars, unless I'm
misunderstanding you.

An example would be the meta widget, I use different sidebar for diff  
templates and it would be nice to log in in different templates

@Jennifer Hodgdon: $wp_scripts is what I was looking for. Thanks. (I
can get the scripts in the header via another js script.)

Message-ID: <2B9BB8F4-D51B-4775-96CB-A73C6EB8CBCA@tekartist.org>


I've seen that one of the milestones for WP 2.7 will be built-in oauth  
support.

I've scanned my trusty WP trunk checkout for "oauth" (case  
insensitive) and I can't locate anything so far.

Am I missing something or is there nothing in the pub repo yet?

I'm asking because our WP plugins have implemented and use OAuth for  
our functionalities already, and I'll have to make extra sure that our  
implementation does not conflict with WP's.

Any pointer?

Thanks.

I inserted this code in footer.php and nothing happened. How can I see
other global variables like $wpdb, but not $wp_scripts?

Thanks scribu. Just svn co'd it, but still no refs to oauth in the  
codebase so far (grep -rli oauth .).

I'll monitor the branch and go as it comes (unless someone has an  
insight on a timeframe).

Cheers,

Stephane

I'm sorry if what I wrote was confusing. I am referring to the widgets  
that have NOT been enabled to work in multiple sidebars as of this  
point.

For example, in the default widgets provided with the current tagged  
2.6 release, links, meta, recent comments ... are single sidebar  
widgets and are not multiple sidebar enabled.

I was asking:

1) has anyone done this yet?
2) if we do it, should we contribute that for 2.7?

It's pretty early in the 2.7 development cycle, and I'm not at all
sure that the list on the Codex is one of definite milestones.

To my knowledge there's is currently no OAuth code in the core WP  
code.  Just in the last day I've seen a few people talking about it  
working on the code for, I'm trying to confirm if these folks are  
working towards another plugin (there's already an OAuth plugin that  
is PHP5 only) or to get their work into WP core.

Well, it's really up to the widget itself, isn't it? It doesn't make
sense for all widgets to be available in more than one place at the
same time.

A multi-widget is multi, a single widget is single.

Again, I feel like I'm confused. There's nothing to contribute here,
the text widget is multi, the rest of the defaults are not, and that's
pretty much that. Why would you wan tthe meta widget to be multi, for
example? It makes no sense.

Additional: What do you mean by "multiple-sidebar-enabled", exactly?
You can have as many sidebars as you want, and widgets can go on any
of them.

Do you mean multi-instance widgets? Like the Text widget? Because all
widgets, even single-instance ones, can go on any sidebar.

I have a feeling Shane may be refering to using the Single widgets on  
multiple sidebars, Which at present, is not possible.

At first you may ask "Why would i want a widget shown on multiple sidebars  
at the same time!", but then you need to understand that that is only one  
setup of multiple sidebars.

My main blog needs to have the single widgets on multiple sidebars, As i  
havef a different sidebar depending if you're viewing the Blog or a Page,  
I use WP as more of a CMS with a Blog subsection in that way. I also have  
another few projects which uses sidebars completely differently & as such  
needs widgets on multiple sidebars.
eg: http://dd32.id.au/ compared to http://dd32.id.au/blog/

Now, Back to Shane:
If thats the kind of effect you're after, then it can be done via some  
'hacks' in the themes functions.php file:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4280#comment:39
Register whatever sidebars you want, And insert them where you need them,  
Then add the filters into your themes functions.php file.

I chose not to attempt to modify the core widgets to support multiple  
sidebars, Mearly because the umpteen times i've tried to update a plugin  
to allow it.. i've failed miserably, the API to do it is just plain  
unuseable to me, it makes no sense :) -- but it certainly works.. for  
other people, and wanting to have them on multiple sidebars is also a very  
edge case, and in many cases, will also break XHTML validation due to  
duplicated ID's and the like.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multiple options vs. one large serialized option
Message-ID: <8f93a7390808080504y117f32e5h91e1ba7d0c0070a5@mail.gmail.com>

I have a plugin (Viper's Video Quicktags) that I'm currently recoding from
scratch and I'm wondering how I should store my options.

I have a decent set of configuration variables (sizes, colors, etc.) so I
can't decide if I should store them in one option or break them up a bit
(like one per video format or something). I'm not storing huge chunks of
text or anything crazy like that, just small strings and some variables.

So what's the "cutoff" where it becomes more efficient to break it up than
store it in one big long serialized string in the database? Or is there one?
It'd be easier for me to store it all in one option, but I'm not sure what
would be best from a performance standpoint.

The only reason I would cut options in 2 sets would be for instance:
- set1 stored with autoload = yes, containing everything that you'll
need on blog pages
- set2 stored with autoload = no, containing everything needed for admin area

Therefore, a smaller set1 would be read on WP init, and you don't mind
adding an extra query when viewing an admin page to fetch set2

But anyway I don't think it's really worth it avoiding to store
everything in one entry.

Anything in the admin area will be needed for the front end as well.

I was thinking one per video format so that if the user only displayed
YouTube videos for example then only the YouTube settings would be loaded,
but with autoload they're already loaded and with autoload off that'd
require an extra query so that doesn't make any sense.

One "large" option it is. Thanks. :)

The latest nightly won't show the admin section.

I can see my test blog, but any admin section pages come up blank  
page.  Source is blank.

Pretty new to the SVN thing, so if there's something there I might  
have goofed up, I'm open to suggestions, but I can't get last night's  
update to work.

No plugins running (emptied the directory -- no change).

You could certainly do an array of arrays. :)

Probably a fatal error due to some error.

Ensure that Error reporting is turned on, And that WPDEBUG is defined as  
true in your wp-config.php file :)
define('WPDEBUG', true);

See if that sheds any light for you.

There definitely is a cut-off point, though I don't think you're in any
danger of getting there.

I recently had to abandon using a word count plugin which stored all its
data in one nicely serialised option. That would have been OK, except the
data comprised a count of words for each post, counts broken down in
various ways, assorted statistics and much more. It was over 300kb. Now
*that* might not have been too bad, but it rewrote the data every time a
post was saved. Or changed. And yes, a spam comment being blocked by
Akismet was enough to trigger it. 

I was wondering why my virtual private server was having insane memory
spikes. It wasn't untl someone sent me screen capture of MySQL getting
*really* upset that I worked it out...

The point of the story being that it wasn't until this huge option field
got to a very large size that there was any apparent issue.

Ahah! One of those people who insist on passing serialized data to  
update_option()...

Honestly: update_option() serializes any non-string data thats passed to  
it allready, get_option() will unserialize on return as well, In some  
cases you can end up with PHP double-serializing the string which while  
your code works fine with, it can create higher load on PHP..

My advice to all plugin developers: Just pass the data in and let the API  
do the serializing...

It's a question of scaling. What makes the array grow?

Does the array have a relatively constant size? If the plugin only
stores its configuration, a single options row is ideal for that.

Does the array grow every time a video is added to a post? In that
case, don't put the post-related stuff in options! Use postmeta.

'Insist' is overstating it a little; until recently I didn't even
realise that get_ and update_option serialised and unserialised
objects passed into them automatically. It could definitely be better
documented, both in the inline documentation and in the Codex. If I
have time over the weekend I'll try to remedy that.

Okay, I see the idea here, but if this is implemented correctly, it
requires no changes to the widgets at all. In other words, you don't
want multiple widgets, you want multiple sidebars able to hold the
same copies of single widgets.

Let's define some terms, so we don't get all confused.
A "multi-widget" is one where you can have multiple copies of the
widget, each with different settings.
A "single-widget" is one where you can have one copy of the widget,
with one set of settings.

Nothing really prevents you from showing that single widgets in
multiple places though. It's only the interface that doesn't really
allow for it. In theory, I see no reason that you could not have the
same id in different parts of the sidebars_widgets array and thus call
it multiple times.

Nope, the array is a constant size and will only grow if I add support for
additional video sites.

Hi y'all.

I've been plugging away at this Vanilla theme that relies very heavily on
widgets.

I have dispensed with sidebars, and have instead widgetized the entire page,
which is more of what you'd expect in CMS "best practice".

No problems there.

However, when I install my theme it really doesn't look like much until I
manually go and grab a bunch of widgets, populate a few of them, and stick
them in the relevant widget blocks (sidebars, in the traditional
"language").

What I want is a way to do that automatically. Has anyone done anything on
this? I'm not a hard-core PHP dev, so it will take me a long time to do
this, hence wanting to know first what others may have done in this are.

Specifically I'm wanting to hook some "actions" together: when a theme is
installed I want to be able to add into the "init" event some way to
populate text widgets with some content and push them into a widget block
(sidebar).

I hope that makes sense.

Anyone done any of this??

Cheers,

-Alister

It seems that $wp_scripts is set only if there is a script added,
which is normal. So I managed to check if jquery is already loaded by
doing  in_array('jquery', $wp_scripts->done)  and then adding the css
and js files to the head via another javascript.

Take a look at the options rows that hold the widget configuration.
You can modify those.

The trick is in knowing when the theme has just been activated. Plugin
activation comes with a customized action but themes aren't treated
that way. In your theme's functions.php do:

if ( is_admin() && !get_option('mythemeisinstalled') ) {
  // set up the widgets here

  add_option('mythemeisinstalled', true);
}

Absolutely no warranties. :-)

Possibly the simplest way, though not as reliable as a hook, is to
check for 'themes.php?activated=true'.

Message-ID: <fd3b80510808091035y8205aedp53af724ae45e3c84@mail.gmail.com>

The new admin POST handler (see Codex and Trac ticket links below) is
obviously suitable for plugins that want to perform administrative
actions. When I first saw it, however, I was hoping that it was a more
generic POST handler, i.e. that I could use it for e.g. a contact
form, and just throw some data at it which would be handled by an
appropriate plugin, and thrown away if one wasn't provided.

<http://codex.wordpress.org/Handling_POST_and_AJAX_Requests>
<http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7283>

Anyway, just posting this here on the off-chance there was some
unstated plan to add that kind of capability, and to test the waters
in case other people would be interested in something like that.
Obviously it's named admin-post, not wp-post, so its intended purpose
is clear, but having a single point of entry to handle unauthenticated
POST requests would be handy, at least for me.

Right, thanks.

I have another question though. What would be the best way of
processing a lot of shortcodes? Making a function for each seems
wasteful (these shortcodes don't have any attributes and are all
self-closing).

Message-ID: <ae81acd10808100228n5e3d69aaxbc182d95f72c102a@mail.gmail.com>

Just a quick note: the search function of the Plugin Directory sucks
to a point it's not even worth trying to use it.
Example:
<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=paypal> returns a
bunch of plugins that are not even related to paypal except maybe
their download link (#1 return is Google XML Sitemap for instance)

There has to be something totally trivial to enhance this.

Cheers

Why is it wasteful? And what alternative is there other than pointing them
all at the same function?

How can I point them at the same function if the don't return the name
of the shortcode to it (or, at least, not that I can tell)?

No, there isn't, but I've had a patch open for a while to do that:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6606

You'll need to write wrapper functions if you want the shortcode all
processed by one function (this is forward compatible with my patch):


add_shortcode( 'foo', 'shortcode_foo' );
add_shortcode( 'bar', 'shortcode_bar' );

function shortcode_foo( $atts, $content = NULL ) {
    return myshortcode( $atts, $content, 'foo' );
}

function shortcode_bar( $atts, $content = NULL ) {
    return myshortcode( $atts, $content, 'bar' );
}

function myshortcode( $atts, $content, $tag ) {

    /* Do Stuff */

    return $something;
}

2.6.1 is for bug fixes. ;)

I've noticed the same thing. I think it started when the new design
was rolled out with WP 2.5

They even use a custom search plugin on wordpress.org, So its better than  
bbPress default.. but yes, it still sucks..

(bbPress default: search for "akismet" and akismet is on the 6th page  
ranked about 70-ish..)

Not sure what was wrong.  Wiped the directory and re-"up"ed svn.   
Worked fine after that.  (This is my test server.)

Thanks though. :)

This is not technically a WordPress question, but a question about 
Trac/SVN integration.

On trac.wordpress.org, I think it is set up so that if someone does an 
SVN checkin with a string like "fixes bug #1223" in the checkin 
comment, then the changeset comment automatically also gets added as a 
comment to bug #1223.

I'm using Trac/SVN on another project, and it isn't adding comments to 
the bug reports, although the reverse links are there (i.e. if you 
look at changeset [3445], text like "#1223" links to the Trac issue, 
but I think that is just due to Wiki formatting, not sure).

Does anyone know how to make those automatic comments happen? Is it 
because we are on Trac 0.10.4 on the other project, and WP is on 
0.10.5, or something else? Any ideas?

Thanks,
    Jennifer

As far as I know, the linking is an out-of-the-box feature that should
be available in your version of trac. So, r1234 would make a link to
the revision 1234, and #1234 would create a link to ticket number
1234.

As for automatically adding the comment to the ticket if you reference
the ticket number in the checkin comment, I would assume that this is
done either by a post-commit hook in subversion and/or a trac plugin.
I always just assumed that whoever did the checkin also manually added
a comment to the ticket.

Thanks Ryan! I will have to see if that script is on the Trac 
installation I am using on the other project. Possibly I was just not 
following the syntax exactly. I hadn't seen anything about this in the 
Trac documentation, so I very much appreciate the reference.

Regards,
    Jennifer

Hi all --

Of possible interest to plugin and theme authors:

There's an updated version of my Log Deprecated Calls plugin.
<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/features/wp-log-deprecated-calls/>

Now you can log them to the database, and view that log within the  
admin section.  It also serves as an example plugin for the new  
uninstall.php function coming in WP 2.7

Regards,

Stephen

Wouldn't it be "files"?

This plugin does sound interesting, though.

I looked at it, and at a glance i thought the answer was going to be "yes"  
or "true" or something... :S Prooves you have to actually read it rather  
than skimming it..

so IMO the spam plugin is working for sure! :P

I find tag surfing to be a much better search tool for the plugin db.

Heh...  Added a blank to make it more clear what exactly the question  
wants.

Maybe I should leave it on the default "2 + 2 =", but where's the fun  
in that? ;)

Somebody emailed me to say he liked the quiz because "it's like 'Are  
You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?', WordPress style".

That one was confusing though.  The blank clears it up, I hope....

Use this custom search engine I just created:

http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=006835583451239722573:15duy8wtjos

and you should be good :)

To keep remembering this thing I've made a redirect:

http://yoast.com/out/wpsearch/

I've made some tweaks to it so it won't show indexed search result  
pages, tag pages, stats pages etc.

Cheers,
Joost

Just a note:
WordPress 2.7 includes a Plugin installer, Which allows you to browse  
through the WordPress.org/extend/plugins/ directory from within WordPress.
It allows searching via a Term, or author, or tag surfing. (And also has  
Page'd search results for everything)

Currently the Views (Latest relesaes, recently updated, popular plugins,  
etc) are currently limited to 6-plugins, and are pretty much static, I'm  
hoping to get that a bit more fleshy in the coming future.

However, Its using the same search engine as WordPress.org/extend/plugins/  
is using, so it'll be limited to the same result sets (but it'll have  
paging..)

Yeah, I've been using this, and limiting it to 6 plugins is just awful
when the search is so blowful.

It really, really needs paging. Or a better search engine. Or a way to
directly install a given plugin if you're on the extend website or
know it's url or some such thing...

Ugh. I hate those quiz things.

I installed Donncha's Cookies For Comments recently and it's worked
fairly well: http://ocaoimh.ie/cookies-for-comments/

I recommend it instead.

I'm amused that my post has generated more feedback about a completely  
different plugin than for the one I posted about. Heh.

Either way, useful feedback....  :)

You might want to fix your system time. It says that you sent this from 
a little more than ten days in the future.

I agree that using tags to find plugins on the site is much more useful, 
but that's a given. Using the tags is functional while searching is not, 
so using a solution that is less than optimal but functional is always 
better than using a solution that doesn't work at all. There are many 
things on the WordPress.org site that need a complete overhaul, and the 
plugin search function is one of them.

IMO they don't have the same goal. CFC checks if you have the permission 
to comment, while Stephen's Spam Quizz checks if you *deserve* to comment. 
One is for protection against bots, the other is for protection against 
dummies :)

LOL

Mainly the goal is to require human thought.  Even then, some spammers  
have actually turned to using live people to sit there and fill in  
captchas all day.  So the goal is that you have to have actually read  
the thing.  The default "2 + 2 =" question is okay, but it doesn't  
cover that -- as it's independent of any post content.

> (sometimes questions are tough though)


The biggest thing about it is that it's _very_ easy to make the  
questions too hard.  I'm not trying to outwit people! Things I've  
learned:

1) Inserting a _______ blank goes a long way to making the question  
clear
2) Stick to short, simple answers.  One word is a good length.
3) Avoid asking about niddly little details, unless it's core to the  
point of the article
4) Be aware of obvious alternates
5) I'll ask just about anything related to a really short post, but  
don't make readers dig through a really long one looking for some detail
6) Only ask questions that are answered within the text of the article

In response to #4, the newest version allows you to specify multiple  
correct answers. :)

Oh yeah...
<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/wp-comment-quiz/>

*** Coding Question for you all: ***

I've seen a particular problem in a number of anti-spam measures,  
including this one, and I was wondering if anyone knows of a fix.  You  
answer the question (or captcha, or whatever), and you get it wrong.   
You click the "Back" button and your comment is gone!

It seems totally random to me:  Sometimes the comment is still there,  
sometimes the form is blank.  Why does this happen?  (On the Quiz  
plugin it's _usually_ still there, but sometimes it's blanked....)

I've gotten in the habit of copying my comment to clipboard any time  
there's a captcha, but I wish I knew how to fix this.

P.S. -- Okay... I could probably figure out a way to repeat the  
comment form on the "Wrong Answer" page, but is there an easier way to  
just make the Back button work?

Regards,

Stephen

I prefer methods that don't rely on JavaScript.  yes, virtually  
everyone has JS, but some don't.  And Yes, I've had at least one  
person (a personal friend) contact me and say he was blocked because  
he didn't have JavaScript.  (Different anti-spam, obviously.)

He knew me, so he bothered to contact me.  Have I lost other comments  
to people who didn't know me?

(Obviously the quiz blocks some other comments, too -- Sorry Viper!   
See my other email regarding that issue -- it's been a learning  
experience!)

My problem with captchas is more basic than that.

Let's say I've taken the time to read and write a coherent response to
your article, or to give you any sort of feedback whatsoever. I write
out a response, fill in my details (or have them filled in for me),
and hit submit. And the first thing that happens is it tells me that I
screwed up your captcha. Not a good User Experience. So, what's my
response? Well, mainly I get pissed off at your stupid hoop-jumping
bullshit, close your tab, and never visit your site ever again. You've
lost a response and a reader all in one shot.


See, I'm not expecting captchas. Not only are they not necessary, they
actively drive people away. Sure, I'm a power-user and it doesn't
happen to me much, but do you only want o get responses from the
technologically literate? A non-tech user sees "what's 2+2" (a
completely ineffective and useless captcha, BTW.. word-based math
problems are trivially solved, even google can do it) and wonders why
you're asking a stupid question like that. If they answer wrong (typo,
don't bother to fill it in, whatever), then they get kicked out of
your system.


Captchas, of any sort, DON'T WORK. Period. They don't prevent spam,
they just annoy commentors. What they prevent is poorly written bots
that use your front comment door (perhaps 1-2% of spam-bots fit into
this category) from getting through. Most spambots use the trackback
door, or run stupid math questions like that through google, or
something else. You are annoying a lot of your readers in order to
prevent, what, a small number of bots from getting through? Not a good
plan.

Real spam detection is much simpler. The simple cookie approach works
most of the time, but it's naturally not wholly effective. Akismet
works and very well too. Simple Trackback Validation stops all the
trackback spam I've ever seen. Even known-bot header detection will
stop all of the spam bots that your approach stops, and it will do it
without annoying one casual user too.

The best fix: Remove the captcha. Use a real anti-spam method instead
of half-assing it.

Cookies for Comments does not rely on javascript at all. It relies on
having a modern browser which loads stylesheets and cookies.

Cookies for comments sounds nice, but then how do you handle
ping/trackbacks?

Defensio works decently well for me personally.

Since March 23rd:

* 295755 spam
* 848 legitimate comments
* 109 false negatives (undetected spam)
* 54 false positives (legitimate comments identified as spam)


Although I'm always open to suggestions and that cookies for comments seems
nice enough, at least until the bots get smart enough to start using session
cookies.

Message-ID: <8d1a68fa0808122204k7d929726k35d7e193511d3979@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

when rendering a result from a plugin search in the new plugin
installer, display_plugins_table() injects a link to an URL retrieved
from the plugins meta data (@see
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/includes/plugin-install.php?rev=8630#L207).

As up to this point there's no established level of trust between the
consuming WP site and the plugin homepage URL, I wonder why this
injection is deemed appropriate with respect to potential privacy and
security implications.

>From my understanding, the WP plugin repository is at least at present
not thoroughly screened for potential malware or abusive content at
plugins' homepages, so this deliberate linking might impose all kinds
of threats. Please understand that I am particularly concerned with
the presentation of search results. Any other plugin listing employs
"trusted" plugins which are at least installed on the target site.

Payloaded WordPress plugins already are a common SEO tactic (@see
http://www.anty.info/2008/08/06/pingcrawl-injects-links/), and I
wonder how long it would take before one would social-engineer
unsuspecting WP 2.7 users as an easy prey for a plugin with
"behind-the-scenes" functionality.


Cheers,

Robert 'wet' Wetzlmayr

Hiya,
First, Let me introduce myself as DD32, or Dion, I'm the one who's been  
writing the installer as part of a Google Summer of Code project, I do not  
anticipate that it'll be finished by the end of the GSOC timeline, however  
it'll be polished for 2.7 release, The Code has been commited to get it  
out there earl in the dev cycle to get feedback, and allow a decent  
ammount of time to be given to ironing out any issues, bugs, security  
implications, or otherwise.

Posting this to the Trac ticket would've been more appropriate IMO at this  
point of development too.

Yes, At present its assumed that the data returned from Wordpress.org has  
been sanitized, And while plugins on wordpress.org get checked if they're  
mearly spam, ongoing checks do not get performed, So checking that the  
data is not malformed does need to be added in some places, I should point  
out its currently a work in progress, I have a few major changes which  
i've not yet submitted to Trac.

So Yes, That line you pointed out needs to use attribute_escape() to  
ensure it cant insert any other HTML for example
However, There is also the more prominent issue of plugins conaining rogue  
php code, which is going to be more dangerous than meta data containing  
malformed html

I do not feel that Linking to the homepage from within WordPress is a  
security implication, Rather something which the user is going to expect,  
The user may want to give the authors homepage(or the plugins homepage) a  
squiz before deciding they trust the plugin.
The WordPress.org page links to the authors homepage, and so does the  
Plugins page inside wordpress for installed plugins, Its simply too much  
to expect Someone to Veto every link and page mentioned by a plugin every  
day, People need to use common sense when browsing the internet.

An extra function on wordpress.org to report a plugin as "bad" and  
including a reason could be a step forward for future if huge issues  
arrise or if a plugin slips through the initial screening process, There's  
not a huge ammount of people who currently screen plugins (Theres a reason  
it takes 2 weeks for a plugin to be allowed through sometimes) - And i  
know a fair few pure spam plugins get knocked back. Because as i said, Its  
impossible for someone to check all the links 24/7.

Just noticed that the entire of WordPress.com is down -- it's
displaying a message "no site admin".

Even sites hosted by WP.com infrastructure such as GigaOM or I Can Has
Cheezburger are down. Ouch.

I can't access the support page, so hopefully someone from Automattic

Indeed. It's back up. Kudos to whoever brought it back up. :)

I noticed they now have shifted around the columns on the WP.com home
page -- seems like they broke something in the process of updating it.

Perhaps they were just in the process of updating the very same thing you
noticed and so the site was down momentarily :).

Simple Trackback Validation:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-trackback-validation/

It does an IP lookup to make sure that the IP of the sending party
matches that of the website it's claiming to speak for. If that
passes, then it actually loads the external URL and looks for the link
back to the blog. If that passes, then it calls it a legit trackback
and there you go.

Fast, simple, quite effective. I have not had a false positive or
negative from it yet.

Yeah, but I figure that a spambot which a) loads the stylesheets of
the page and then b) uses cookies as well is one of those rare things
which is almost self-defeating. The whole point of mass spamming is to
get your spammy message out to tons of sites quickly. If they have to
actually load whole pages and associated files just to leave their
comments, then they quickly run into a bandwidth/speed issue.

+1

We really need a way for people to report plugins as bad if we're
going to allow them to be sent directly to installs with just a few
clicks.

Hey guys, I developed a debug plugin for wordpress in an effort to make 
my life easer when doing wordpress development and checking problems on 
my blog. I would appreciate it very much if you guys would test the 
plugin and let me know what improvements if any I could make. Thanks.

Here is the link: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pear-debug/

Please excuse the difference between the actual version number and the 
version number reported on the plugin page. I am new to subversion. This 
will be sorted out in the next version.

Subject: [wp-hackers] The life and times of an HTTP request
Message-ID: <48A333C1.5010609@thenextwave.biz>

Assumption #1: If I'm using pretty permalinks, my .htaccess file is 
telling the server to route every HTTP request to the index.php

Assumption #2: Because of #1, this includes all HTTP requests for style 
sheets, javascript files, images, etc.

After  using Google, and Google site: search on the wp-hackers mailing 
list archive, I couldn't find a sufficient answer... I've leapfrogged 
through the WordPress source, starting at the index, working my way to 
parse_request() inside the WP() class, followed through send_headers(), 
but I'm missing the elephant in the room: How/where does WordPress 
retrieve and send those files back to the web browser?

Thanks for answering my dumb question / Sorry for asking a dumb, most 
likely previously answered question :)

You .httaccess file should exclude files that already exist.  It  
should look something like this:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

The rewrite conditions tell the server to serve your stylesheets,  
javascript, etc without being routed to index.php

More specifically, it specifies `!-f` and `!-d` so that it first
checks if the file or directory already exists, if it does it serves
that, if it doesn't, it rewrites it to index.php.

See this for more information about -f, -d and RewriteCond:

Just to be clear, the web server (Apache, IIS, whatever) sends
a response to the web browser, not WordPress.
The .htaccess files work in concert with the web server and
are independent of whatever files or scripts exist in the directory
where they reside.

I get LOTS of spam from sites actually linking to my posts, so that doesn't
help much for me.

Hi,

I've helped some friends lately, and one hadn't discovered WP_SITEURL
and WP_HOME, and in a few other situations, it would have been
convenient if I could just uncomment the DEBUG define.

There is a great tradition in having the config variables included in
the file commented out. Is this not the WordPress way?

Thank you,

what about having a wp-config-sample-advanced.php which included all the  
"advanced" options & defines maybe?
A few applications come with "Base" "standard" and "Advanced" config file  
defaults..

Most of the SITEURL & HOME defines are generally not going to be used by  
most users, infact, I'd suggest against it except for debug and test  
installs - just so that changing it in the future can be done from the  
admin panel(for whatever reason)

I guess we wouldn't be able to fit all that in some phpdoc comments?

Or maybe we could point to a page in the Codex that just has the
possible define's (and a short description)?

Subject: [wp-hackers] next_posts_link's parameter $max_posts
Message-ID: <48A3E04F.7090500@elektroelch.de>

Hi,

during answering some support questions I ran across a mysterious 
parameter of the next_posts_link function:

function next_posts_link($label='Next Page &raquo;', $max_page=0)

What's the $max_page parameter for? In the function itself the parameter 
will be set the following way:

if ( !$max_page ) {
        $max_page = $wp_query->max_num_pages;
    }

Is it only a relict or is there a meaningful scenario to use this 
parameter? The Codex skips the explanation...

I don't think WordPress does anything to select the IP address it
uses to send trackbacks.  In other words, I think it will use the
primary IP address configured on the host.

I run all websites on secondary IP addresses, so I guess I cannot
send trackbacks to users of this plugin.

My own website couldn't even run on the primary IP address of the
host, as I'm using HTTPS as well.

Best regards,

Looking at the source, Its designed to limit the amount of "Next page"  
possible.

Eg,
next_posts_link('next page', 3);
If theres 10 pages of results, it would show the link on the first 3  
pages, But the 4th and onwards would not have the link.

If its not set, Then it automatically gets set to the number of pages in  
the current result set, So it'd link on page 9, but not 10 (as theres no  
11th page)

Ok, after reading this I understand what it's meant for and I might even 
see a somewhat reasonable usage for the parameter: if I just want the 
user to see e.g. the last 50 postings. I never thought of wanting such a 
feature... well, maybe in the search results, to avoid displaying 
ancient postings.

Thanks for the clarification, I'm going to add it to the Codex.

http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php   covers all of this.

I think a link to that page in wp-config.php would suffice.

Why can't you use one IP?

Virtual Hosts. Use 'em, love 'em.

Why use one IP when you can use a dedicated one? All my boxes have multiple
IPs, so I might as well make use of them. Plus it makes it harder to do
reverse lookups of other sites on that box. ;)

I wrote phpdoc inline documentation for the file a while back. I'm 
planning on touching up the patch, so that it can be included into core. 
There was something wrong with the previous patch that prevent it from 
being committed. I'll add the link when I do so. Should be before the 
week is over. I'm planning on adding a lot of inline documentation to 
other directories besides wp-includes.

At the very least, I hope to have all of the other directories fully 
inline documented, even if wp-includes is not. It would be most good 
looking at PHP Xref sites and getting the descriptions for the files.

Cheers, and thanks for the link.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help w/ cURL and Google Maps
Message-ID: <000601c8fe53$ecf1a820$c6d4f860$@com>

This issue isn't completely related to WordPress but it does affect a
WordPress plugin I am working on and this group is one of the best with
respect to PHP and MySQL issues that I have encountered.

I am running into an issue trying to use Google Maps via cURL from a site
hosted by GoDaddy.  It works fine on my laptop in my development area but
the same code times out when run on the production server.  This is for a
project I am working on for someone else so the server choice isn't mine.
My Google searches haven't yielded any results and I haven't had a response
from GoDaddy either.  I have set the cURL timeout to 2, 5, 10, and 0 and all
fail.  Setting it to 0 ultimately ends up in an abort on my server because
the script execution time is exceeded.

Anyone else run into this?

Why use cURL for Google Maps? It's a JavaScript API.

By the way, I have a (I think pretty good) Google Maps WP plugin 
available:
    http://poplarware.com/routesplugin.html

I've never heard of any complaints of it not working on GoDaddy.

Out of curiosity I checked the link and -- wtf? AUTH_KEY,
SECURE_AUTH_KEY and LOGGED_IN_KEY ???
I knew about AUTH_KEY because either it's been more advertised or
because I was offline when 2.6 came out, but didn't know about the 2
others.

How come upgrade.php does not update the wp-config.php too ? It's
pretty obvious that 99% of people out there don't have things like
these in their wp-config.php.

Using cURL with GoDaddy hosting requires that you set a proxy. Adding
these 3 lines should fix this:

curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL, TRUE);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE, CURLPROXY_HTTP);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_PROXY,"http://proxy.shr.secureserver.net:3128");

Why use CURL? Not all hosts have that by default... I'd use the built  
in Snoopy instead.

Seperate cookies (and keys) are now used for the admin area vs. the main
blog. This allows for better security and forcing SSL for the admin.

The web server has to choose the correct certificate for SSL before
it gets any information from the client (e.g. browser).  Thus you
cannot use a name-based (i.e. shared IP) virtual host with HTTPS.

Thanks for the tip, it got me a little farther.  I am using the following:

    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url) ;
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1) ;
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE, CURLPROXY_HTTP) ;
    curl_setopt ($ch,
CURLOPT_PROXY,"http://proxy.shr.secureserver.net:3128") ;
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 120) 

Now when I run it I get an incomplete response from the server when compared
to my development environment. GoDaddy finally got back to me and even
though cURL is enabled in their PHP environment, GoDaddy says they don't
support cURL on a Windows server (which is what I am working with).

It's close, so close.

PHP on GoDaddy's Windows' servers is pretty much useless...

I personally use my own plugin which adds a hidden nonce to the comment 
form, to ensure that the backend can't be used directly. Can anyone see 
any cons on this? (Of course, this doesn't affect trackbacks, so I use 
Simple Trackback Validation as well)

I was not aware of Snoopy but it looks like it will do what I want, thanks
for the pointer.

So I reconfigured my class to use Snoopy instead of cURL and it too works in
my dev environment but fails in production with a timeout.  I am guess that
GoDaddy (I am starting to agree with Matt who said their Windows PHP support
useless) requires a proxy of some sort to use fsockopen().  Of course, there
is nothing in their help pages about fsockopen() other than a statement
which says it is supported.

If one migrates wp-config.php manually during earlier versions, even
AUTH_KEY would not be available. May be the 'recommendation' on the
net is correct: one shouldn't be using wp if not following its
development lists. See this ticket:

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5538

Submitted before '08, but milestone pushed to at least 1yr from now.

No, you are incorrect. 2.9 is just the milestone for tickets that have no
patch, etc. If a patch shows up and is green lighted, then it goes into
trunk.

As has been stated, the two new ones only really change things if
you're using SSL.

It's like this:
- WP 2.5 introduced "SECRET_KEY" to make the cookie encryption stronger.
- WP 2.6 supports SSL admin, and so uses three separate cookies (one
for auth, one for ssl auth, and one for logged in user identity).

However, these are all optional. If you don't have a secret key, 2.5
is just as secure as previous versions were. If you don't use SSL,
then still having a SECRET_KEY instead of the three new ones is just
the same.

See here for more details:

Because editing somebody's wp-config.php is problematic. For one
thing, this file can be customized a lot. It's usually the case that
users have hand-edited these files, and breaking a user's main
configuration file on an upgrade is a pretty bad user experience.

For the newer WP 2.7 and up, you might want to look at the new HTTP
functions that are built in. wp-includes/http.php. wp_remote_get,
wp_remote_post, etc. These are the sane ways to go in the future, as
they will automatically detect and support five different ways of
doing stuff, sparing you all the trouble.

Sure you can. Look up TLS-SNI. It's been around for a few years.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication

To do this with Apache:
http://www.outoforder.cc/projects/apache/mod_gnutls

LiteSpeed and nginx also have support for it now.

I checked the commented version fo wp-config-sample.php in the trunk
and... it's a mess.

To much comment text usefull for phpdoc totally unusefull for commen
users, first lot of people prepare theyr wp-config.php file copyng
this one and editing it by hand, the previous version was enough
commented. Second that file have comment translated for locale version
by localization team and now there is a bunch of tech text to
translate that give no more info for "normal" users.

I Would prefere having a section with the olde well comment method
talking about variuos variable that can be set than this version.

Sorry to say that the good work you have done is totally unusefull for
the majority of the WP users.

No thanks -- I don't especially want to start maintaining either
Apache or nginx through private packages.

Also, last I checked, mod_gnutls came with a performance warning.

But sure, if you want to code your plugins so that they don't account
for sites using secondary IP addresses, you can certainly choose to
do so.

Probably best to keep the comments simple, and put in a link to Codex  
for more advanced stuff.

Power Users will figure it out.  That's why they're "Power Users".   
Don't make it hard for the little guy. (Ever!)

My point is that there is no legitimate reason to make sites that use
multiple addresses for the specific case of trackbacks. In other
words, if your website is going to contact me, and the IP I'm getting
that from doesn't match your site's actual IP, then there's no reason
for me to assume that you are legitimate.

The specific problem you're speaking of (SSL not working with name
based virtual hosting) is a solved one. You *can* use SSL with name
based hosting. The SNI extension to TLS was invented specifically to
solve the problem. Why not use it?

Also, the main nginx package does support TLS SNI. No "private

Two questions:

1) Is there a way to prevent _any_ auto formatting for a particular  
post?  I want to allow content to be shown without any added <p>,  
<br>, etc...  Display it _exactly_ as it was entered.

2) Is there a way for a plugin to allow use of a page template that is  
located in the plugin folder, or MUST it be moved to the theme folder?

Thanks,

You can you this plugin (or just grab the code from it) to do that
(you just disable 'wpautop'):

Here's a quick copy and paste from something that'll help you on your way:


add_action('template_redirect', array(&$this, 'template_redirect'));

...

    public function template_redirect() {
        global $wp_query;
       
        if($this->is_contest()) {
            include(TEMPLATEPATH . '/contest.php');
            exit;
        } elseif ($this->is_entry() && is_single()) {
            include(TEMPLATEPATH . '/entry.php');
            exit;           
        }
       
        if($wp_query->query_vars['pagename'] == 'contest') {
            include(TEMPLATEPATH . '/contest-index.php');
            exit;
        }

Instead of the_content(), just use echo $post->the_content in your theme.

Thanks.

That's about the simplest plugin I've ever seen!  ;-)

Basically I'm trying to make a plugin that says "If this page uses X  
template (part of the plugin), don't format the content."  This helps.

It is a common and normal practise to have more than one IP address on
a host.

Even if I had SNI deployed, I'd still not use the primary IP address on
a host for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.  Using secondary IP addresses makes
it easier to move services from one host to another, while still being
able to access the host itself as before the move.  If you move the only
IP address on a host with the services, you need to assign a new IP
address for the host, update DNS, SSH keys, etc.

Assigning secondary IP addresses for services also avoids the need to
update DNS for the service and wait for the change to propagate, making
the move much easier to schedule and implement.

Should a host fail, it is easier to restore services to another host
using secondary IP addresses, while maintaining the ability to repair
the failed host over the network through its primary IP address.

Secondary IP addresses are mandatory for high availability setups,
where a secondary IP address is shared between multiple hosts but
only activated on one of them (e.g. VRRP and CARP).

If a host implements IPv6 privacy, it will have several IP addresses
at the same time.  The default policy for outbound connections is to
use the most recently acquired privacy address, not the primary IP
address of the host.

I gave reasons, but you chose not to quote them.

The point is not that you cannot use a single IP address for even SSL
hosts, but that it is a common practise to use multiple IP addresses on
a host, and HTTPS is a very common (but not the only) reason to do so.

Not the Debian package for their latest release (etch, 4.0).

However, I see that backports has added nginx 0.5.35 for etch, so that
could be an option now.

Checking i noticed that old post slug is saved on wp_postmeta table
using wp_old_slug" as key for the meta_key column. Why these data is
mantained? For what aim?

Toi avoid having old slug still "active" the only solution was to
deleta the row idirectly in the database.

Delete the old slug after about 6 months, right? Otherwise very bad for 
SEO/external links. Even better not to touch it though.

It's a feature, not a bug.

This is intended for both SEO and URL canonicalization. If you have an  
old post well indexed (or just linked by someone) you'll probably want  
to keep it's SEO blessing even if changing its slug.

This way, if you change that slug and someone tries the old address,  
you'll be redirect (with the proper HTTP header) to the new url,  
without any loss or risk.

This was (is?) also useful for many WP users who couldn't afford fancy  
permalinks (because of their windows hosting, or after a huge  
migration, for example), this trigger lets them to change permalink  
structure without losing search engine indexing, and without breaking  
any external link.

As far as I know there is at least one plugin who gives an interface  
to this thing, but I can't find it in my bookmarks, sorry.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Always finding more and more cleverness in WP...
Message-ID: <161617690808191157i365a5ebbo639bb46208ce1931@mail.gmail.com>

I was making an image.php template for a site, so naturally I'm using
wp_get_attachment_image to get the IMG link for the page. However, I
needed to have it constrain the image size to a certain size.

Looking at the definition for it, I see this:
function wp_get_attachment_image($attachment_id, $size='thumbnail',
$icon = false)

Dang. I didn't want to use one of the predefined sizes in the
Settings->Miscellaneous screen, so I started sifting through the code.
Lo and behold, I find this buried down in image_get_intermediate_size:

function image_get_intermediate_size($post_id, $size='thumbnail') {
...
	// get the best one for a specified set of dimensions
	if ( is_array($size) && !empty($imagedata['sizes']) ) {

Huh? The $size can be an array? Neat!

Reading the code, it actually takes an array of max sizes you want on
each dimension, finds the next biggest one, then eventually returns
the image tag with the sizes you specify (proportionally scaled
correctly, of course). This lets the browser do the grunt work of
scaling the image down to fit. Okay, so browser scaling sucks, it's
still semi-okay at scaling down than up. And newer browsers (FF3) use
good routines to do this anyway.

In short:
<?php echo wp_get_attachment_image( $post->ID, array(600,600) ); ?>
Gives me an IMG tag that has a max size of 600 on one side, using the
next biggest scaled image it has as per the parameters on the
Settings->Miscellaneous screen.

I just found that highly clever and thought everybody should know about it. :)

With $post->the_content all other plugins doing other content
conversion would not work as well, not just wpautop, is it?

$post->the_content is exactly as it came out of the database.

the_content() is essentially just   echo apply_filters( 'the_content',
$post->the_content );

A-yup.  That got me for a bit.  Had to do a print_r on $post.

Obviously I figured it out. :)

Just for the sake of argument, you could also remove ONLY wpautop by
doing a (off hte top of my head):

remove_filter('the_content', 'wpautop');

That way any other filters on the_content would still run, which is
pretty important in case you are (or might in the future) run plugins
that add filters to it. It might also be worth turning the filter back
on after you remove it in case the_content is used later in the page.

IIRC, not just this one. I have had written a plugin that tried to do
some filtering, only to find that "WordPress should correct invalidly
nested XHTML automatically" setting is inteferring with it. In older
wordpress, this setting forcefully turn on wpautop before calling any
plugin, rendering the remove_filter() call completely useless. Don't
even bother to check newer version is doing it anymore.

Oh sorry, I mean the balanceTags() call, not wpautop(). balanceTags is
forcefully called within the_content() for paged content. So to get
paged content in vanilla form, there is only one valid solution:
$post->post_content. And then reapply all other plugin filter calls.
Bah.

Very cool.  I knew something like this could be done, but didn't know  
what the default HTMLification filter was.  I like this better than  
the raw call from the DB.

remove filter
call the_content
add filter

Thanks.

Heh.  I hit "Send" as Abel's email arrived.

$post->post_content it is, then.

Dang, I was hoping I could keep other plugin filters going -- e.g. for  
quicktags.

Is there a way to take a string and say "Take all the filters assigned  
to the_content() and run it on $string" ?  (minus wpautop, 'natch)

I guess look up the list of filters on the_content, then loop through  
and run them all on $string?

Easiest way:

remove_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop' );
echo apply_filters( 'the_content', $string );
add_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop' );

The menu on the sidebar is very cool (in WP 2.7 bleeding).  My only  
criticism is that on the Plugins menu, "Manage Plugins" really ought  
to be the top item, rather than "Install".

Still -- Nice work folks.  Excellent addition.

Okay, actually, my criticism of Install being the top Plugin Menu item  
just got a lot bigger.

You've changed the link for anything that is a sub-menu item of  
plugins.php.  WHY does WordPress insist on these completely arbitrary,  
completely USELESS, plugin-breaking changes?

Zero purpose, and how many plugin developers are going to have to push  
out new versions just to do fixes (and %^*$#%! forked code) for this  
kind of thing?

This is the kind of thing that gives WordPress a bad reputation for  
breaking plugins.  This is the second thing I've seen in 2.7 that  
breaks stuff for no reason -- the first being the pointless changes to  
the output of get_plugin_data().

What a damned waste of time.  AGAIN.

Since WP is used for more than blogging, (more functionalities and
more users), I'm wondering if any validation process exists or is
planned for submitting a new " post "
(I wrote " post " because I'm developing a big  directory plugin for
WP, where users submits sites " as posts ".  And many WP admins use it
for other applications )

Any easy or fancy way to do that ? Like checking required fields are
filled and / or are filled with valid values ?

Cool it be alpha to the point that we could still some major changes
in there (or even a rollback), or is crazyhorse definitely in trunk
for 2.7 ?
See, I'm writing this WordPress book, and, well, screen captures, all
that malarkey...

It's staying in AFAIK, but it has a long, long way to go. Things will be
changing.

Yup, I'm already planning on a separate "What's next for WordPress"
chapter about 2.7, rather than redoing all captures.
Just want to know how close to the final resultat this should be. As I
understand, the crazyhorse tests where more directed at the menu
itself, that shouldn't change, right? Or are further tests planned?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Suggestion: WordPress Plugin overlords for helping
	with optimization and security
Message-ID: <74b84aa30808220524v755749ap9161bb843404b182@mail.gmail.com>

I was reading Lloyd's rebuttal [
http://foolswisdom.com/movable-type-pro-setting-social-networking-free-vaporware-wordpress-buddypress/
], specifically this following quote from Movabletype site:

> prominent independent security researchers do warn,
> "[T]he abysmal security practices of WordPress plugin
> developers places the entire Internet at risk".

Wonder if WordPress would benefit from having a [semi-official] panel
of expert hackers [anyone who thinks he/she is, would be free to join
the panel, which could be just a maillist, or even here on this
group]. These experts would review, and advice [novice] plugin
developers---towards making their  plugins optimum and secure.

WordPress codex could then say something on the lines that it would be
desirable (not a compulsion, as a deviation for simple ones) to have
plugins peer-reviewed prior to check-in.

What do you think?

WordPress makes 4 major releases a year (usually). Unless your book is going
to be self-published or going to print real soon, it might be a bad idea to
get too specific in the what's coming section: <
http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/>. It'd be a shame for your book to cater
to the 2.7 crowd and not publish until 2.8 or 2.9 is out. Just a thought.

No worries, we have that under our belt :)
The book should be published in november, but the publisher wants us
to send the whole content verrrrry soon.
So there's a good chance 2.7 will be available before the book.
The idea anyway was not to redo all captures according to 2.7, but
merely write a last chapter on what to possibly expect.
2.7 is even more of a change to 2.6 than 2.5 was to 2.3, so we just
can't watch crazyhorse going to trunk without wanting to have a say
about it in our dead-tree thing :)

Thoughts:

'Templates' - I think this is an unnecessary change from the 'Design'
label introduced in 2.5. There are all kinds of things that could be
under this menu that aren't directly related to templates, and I don't
think it adds anything that 'Design' Doesn't already get across (while
the opposite is not true). I know that part of the idea is to move
away from 'verbs' and towards 'nouns', but in this case I think Design
really works both ways. You click the Design tab to work on 'your
design', or 'the design' of the blog, which includes selecting theme
as well as things like header images and custom css etc. Hell, even
'widgets' don't really make sense under the 'template' header, as they
are core functionality. Alternately, 'Theme' would be another good
candidate for a label. Templates is just really confusing, because
it's synonymous with 'themes' but has never been used in WP land
before.

'Utilities' - this just bums me out. I feel like this will confuse
people used to the current interface and is a bit haphasard about what
goes in. Couldn't tags and categories be in content? Plugin pages
under 'Users' are appearing under 'utilities'? I'm sure this stuff
will get cleaned up going forward, it's hard to move them without
creating new headings, but maybe that's necessary?

Draggability - While I definitely respect that you guys are bringing
back the draggable posting screen, I think that sacrificing the big
surface for opening/closing metaboxes isn't really worth it. Right now
you can only open and close them by clicking the tiny arrow on the
left, whereas the whole space is reserved for dragging. It would be
nice if instead most of the space was devoted to opening/closing
(which people are liable to do each time they post) and the drag zone
was much smaller, as it should theoretically only be used once per
computer you post from. If there was a 'drag me' icon that showed when
you mouse over the heading of the metabox then people would probably
have a pretty easy time moving things around without being shown.
Here's a screenshot of what i mean:

Something like that was in Crazyhorse earlier. The text was the "handle" 
and the rest of the surface was for opening/closing. Not sure why it was 
reverted. Also it's a bit strange when dragging by the right end as the 
box shrinks and the cursor is "in the air".

I have to agree with this. I think of Design as a noun in this  
context, and Templates doesn't communicate what goes on there. In  
fact, Templates sound like something that would appear UNDER the  
design tab.

I'm waiting for the crazyhorse to go away so that I can svn up. I'm not touching crazyhorse until then. It is kind of sad that the notice fixes were reverted, so that all that work has to be redone for the crazyhorse.

It would be nice to be able to run with WP_DEBUG turned on and only get other code from like plugins and themes showing up.

Yes.  I also note that it's not WP "2.7-bleeding", it's "2.7-hemorrhage"

Cute.

Agreed with the whole "Design vs. Templates" thing: to me, "template"
is really part of the theme-development lingo ("template file" and
such), whereas "design" is what lambda users will naturally be looking
into when wanting to change their blog's look.
Don't really have an opinion on Utilities yet...


I really like the Dashboard's "Right Now" panel, listings the number
of posts, draft, comments, with direct links to their respective
sections. I hope it'll be back, it was a great addition.


I love the drag'n'drop, mostly because you can build your menu as you
wish (central section or right sidebar). Maybe the Title and Post
section could be integrated too, so that you could for instance put
Excerpt in-between them if that's how the blogger feels like (or it
that's how his previous blogware used to do).
I kinda agree with Jeremy on the huge size of the dragging zone -
which are furthermore bound the be an issue with translation : for
instance, "Media added to this post" takes the whole sidebar width
(where it resides by default), and in French it would be longer
(something like
"M?dia ajout?s ? cet article"). I guess it would then wrap to the next
line - and thus double the title zone.
Netvibes (http://www.netvibes.com/) uses regular fonts, and has the
Edit link only appear when the mouse rolls over the single item. Maybe
that would be a better solution?


The Install Plugin item's "Upload a plugin" section is hopefully one
function that I've been wanting to have in WP for for a looooong time,
ever since I saw it in the DotClear project
(http://www.dotclear.net/). This excellent French blogware defines
standard filenames that plugins- and themes-developers must use (like
_define.php which act as a sort of manifest). This way, users can
directly point DotClear to the Zip archive for the plugin or theme,
and let DC do its magic (downloading, checking, installing), without
all the hassle of doing it yourself.
Ever since I saw this in action, I thought it would be a truly great
addition to any blogware - and DotClear uses GPL2 (hint hint :) ).


Couple bugs/issues that might already  have tickets that I haven't found:
 - In Visual Editor mode, the "Visual" tab appears above the
"Show/Hide Kitchen Sink". I'm in 1024*768, so if not resolved, that's
bound to be a problem for a lot of people.
 - In the menubar, close the Content menu so that you can open both
Settings and Plugins without scrolling down. Click one of their items,
for instance Plugin Editor: the page loads and opens Content by
default, and the clicked-item's. I would have expected the menu to
keep the state I put it in: all closed except the ones I left open.
Likewise, I think you should force Content open: if the user has
closed it, don't open it on next reload.
 - Install plugin: HTTP errors are not dealt with, I got a couple
full-screen 502 errors (Bad Gateway) in my face, which could confuse
users.

I think my problem with all this is that I seriously question the  
wisdom of doing a radical interface change in 2.5 and then almost  
immediately doing _another_ radical interface change in 2.7.  It makes  
WP look like something done by people who are just playing around.

Choose an interface, and then use it.  Quit batting your users around  
like a toy to a bored cat.  Geeks (that's us) love this kind of stuff;  
but Joe User HATES it -- DESPISES IT, actually.  I can think of a few  
non-techies who would throw up their hands in disgust at this.

As far as I'm concerned, that choice has already been made.  We've  
made our bed and now we need to sleep in it.  If we wanted to do this  
stuff we should have left the 2.5 interface alone, knowing that we  
wanted to do other stuff almost immediately down the road.

Again, I'm a geek; I'll deal with it.  But we're yanking the rug out  
from under our users (and, again, plugin authors).  IF this is really  
going to happen, so be it; but we then need a moratorium on further  
GUI redesigns for a while -- I would say two years _minimum_.  Choose  
wisely, and don't be short sighted -- we're all gonna be stuck with  
what we choose now.

Sincerely,

Stephen

Or, at least, provide us an official manual for the end user to  
translate and give them... :-)
My main concern between 2.3 and 2.7-* is that I have spent most of my  
time training people and updating documentation for my clients,  
instead of coding my plugins or something else, and this is having a  
dramatic impact on my hours/code ratio.... Am I the only one having  
this issue?

By the way: I *love* the work you're doing on 2.7, really. I just fear  
another week of training for my clients :-)

Stephen is indeed right, at least in parts. Don't get me wrong, there
some good things in this new design, and I'm not to refrain from
change just of the sake of keeping things are they are. I know for a
fact that this has been done to facilitate the everyday life of
everybody, and even adoption rate I guess, and can't have less respect
for both WP devs and HappyCog designers for being able to throw it all
away and start from scratch. Really, congrats for that, it takes guts.

I'm not concerned about geeks - as Stephen says, they'll adapt, and
I'm sure the coredevs are smart enough to make sure 2.7 doesn't break
plugins nor themes.

But users will be angry, that one's for sure. Remember the numerous
(at least on our side of the Atlantic) users that complained about the
new admin in 2.5? This time it will be much worse. While 2.5 could be
seen as a reskinning of 2.3, 2.7 is a whole different thing. At least
in 2.5 most of the top menu remained the same: apart from a change in
labels here and there, the menu was still at the top, just as it had
been since the very beginning (and, indeed, since b2/cafelog).

With 2.7, everything is moved in the sidebar, new categories are
created, etc. The 2.6-27 change is much more important than the
2.3-2.5 was, which was the first big admin update since the 1.2-1.5
one (in march 2005 - more than three years without a change!).

You can't expect users to swallow this one easily, guys. WP has had a
coherent interface ever since 0.70, and even 2.5 didn't break 5 years
of dev (or 7 years if we count b2). Then, within the same year, we get
one major redesign, and then another even bigger one. So I agree with
what Stephen says: this new update has better be here to stay for the
loooong haul, because any further major change in there will make WP
look really bad.
It's quite easy to see, really : remember the numerous 1.5
sub-versions (1.5.1, 1.5.1.1, 15.1.2, 1.5.1.3)? That's when WP got a
first taste at bad reputation (too many holes, too many updates), even
though we all know that security is hard with such major updates, and
speedy updates should be seen as a good thing rather than the other
way around. 2.0 had the same issue, although in a longer timeframe.
Well, now we have 2 major admin updates in one year, not even related
to each other (apart from the design studio): geeks like us just
aknowledge it and keep on doing their thing, but users, oh baby, I
hear the blogposts coming, and not all of them are good. If you don't
want to drop a bomb on them, at least start RIGHT NOW to officially
get the word out about crazyhorse in the official devblog. Eye-testing
in New York is one thing, getting long time users to accept it is a
whole other. Start posting now, my friends.

At first I thought CrazyHorse would be part of a neat new
functionality for WP: user-made admin template. Wow, now THAT would've
been cool! :) Not only would you have been able to let users choose
between 2.5-style or CrazyHorse-style admin, but WP professionnals
would've been able to tailor-build admins for their clients! Imagine
that, best of both worlds, every one is happy, not need for plugins
such as the Tiger one: just build a CSS (and maybe some sort of
manifest), and bam, new admin :)
Thinking about it, 2.7 is still months away: if it were possible to
build this idea into core, you would not only prevent a flood of bad
blogpost and forum posts, but you would make both users and devs even
happier, while still being able to put the hard CrazyHorse work in the
hands of those who wish to. Can you spell win-win? :)

Hopefully the discussion will keep going about this on this mailing
list. Understand that I'm not telling to ditch the great work
(really!) that's been put into CrazyHorse, just as you should not tell
users to suck it up and deal with it. Get the word out, let users
accustomate themselves to the idea of CrazyHorse, and transition will
be smoothier.
And, please think about this user-made admin thing :)

Cheers, coredev team! We love you, really! :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin main file name
Message-ID: <D9868C7B-95E4-4916-BC18-3C272E7D75B5@striderweb.com>

I'm not very familiar with the inner workings of the plugin stuff at  
WP/extend, so I have a question for you all.

I'm creating a "core" file for my plugins that is a standardized chunk  
of common code.  In doing so, it would be handy for me if the main  
plugin file was the same for each plugin.  The _directory_ is  
different, of course, but I want the plugin file itself to be  
plugin_main.php or something like that.

Thus, in wp-content/plugins/...

myplugin/plugin_main.php
anotherplugin/plugin_main.php
thirdplugin/plugin_main.php

Is this a bad idea for some reason I don't know about?  If down the  
road I put these on WP-extend, will it screw up updates or auto- 
install or something?

Thanks.

Stephen

Maybe you could get inspiration from Rob Marsh's Post-Plugin Library
(http://rmarsh.com/plugins/), which serves as a repository of common
code for some other Post-related plugins.
Or maybe I didn't understand your request :)

Hi,

I want to add a list of custom URLs into the result of wp_list_pages()
so that custom URLs can be shown in the page list. (or content list in
my blog) Do you have any idea? Start point? Thank you.

I agree a lot about this and about what Stephen and Paolo wrote. I
supposed crazyhorse was experimental for new idea and that passage to
trunk would be only for small tweaks taken from it. Two new desing in
a year sound like "we did first redesign wrong, watsed our time and
your time and now we are going to try something new. The actual design
was said coming out fron lon deep usability test from happy cog... and
now.. trwo away quite everything and start again with something that
is deeply tested againb usability usinbg laser... people won't
understand it. 2.5 and 2.6 introduced lot of new interesting features
like automatic plugin update and so on.. in 2.7 we are goimg to see
easy installation plugin from repository and lot of new ecting
features (may a WP aouto yupdate too) but all this is going to be not
so apreciated cause the new design cause this is what users see first.
An developpers get mad again, documentation need to be rewritten
(codex first) cause now things that was named for years get ne names,
we people of localizing team can patch this keeping old translation
for new name, I'm planning to keep Design for tempalte etc but anyway
is a bad thing too.

With a sol large base of users the new name for old stuff is a
nonsense, maybe new terms woukld sound bettere and more clear for new
users but I'm not sure, for sure they will piss off old users. I would
prefere if crazyhorse gets out of trunk and stay inb development again
for some months tweakking al refining every aspect of it, and then in
2009 instead of a 2.8 there shoudl be a 3.0 that intriduce this new
interface, good tweaked and refined telling users this will be the
interface for the next few years.. or at least use new design for old
menus not rearranging menus all over and adding some tweaks like the
draggability (that actually as Jeremy Clarke said is far than
funcctional and usable... and this make rise some dubts about the deep
usability test done on crazyhorse.

Just my 2 cents

Seongsu Lee,

You could use wp_list_bookmarks() right next to wp_list_pages(), and  
style them the same. You could also hook the 'wp_list_pages' filter  
and add to the output.

Further weirdness is HappyCog's own description of the 2.5 update:
http://www.happycog.com/design/wordpress/
"As architecture removed cobwebs, a fresh design brought clarity and
pleasure of use to what had been a developer-driven look and feel. The
new look was an evolution of the old WordPress, not a painful rupture
from it. Hierarchy, clarity, and other elements of good design were
brought to bear without "cheating." The same constraints that underlay
earlier WordPress designs?such as the need to use HTML rather than
images and Flash?remain in place."
One can't help but wonder where those sound advices went with
CrazyHorse's new menu.

Stefano is right: this could warrant a 3.0 tag. I've always wondered
what big thing could be in store for the 2.9-30 switch. Why not this?

-x.

I can completely see the point of view of everyone else so far on this
topic, but what bugs me more than the semi-redesign, which I feel people
can adapt to, is the constant changing of vocabulary. We had options and
settings, design and templates and themes, the list goes on.

I think that the change in layout won't throw people quite so much if they
know how to find what they are looking for, and by changing the words used
it is making that task more difficult.

OK, so maybe it only takes a few clicks to find what you want, but why
should users have to experiment to find the right page? I know that when I
see an upgrade like this, I click on EVERYTHING, just to see what's new,
but some users just want to keep doing what they always did, write posts,
and edit them. So the manage that we had in 2.5 is now under content,
semantically no problems, but the change in vocab is unnecessary.

Which brings me on to another point, yeah, we want it to be easy for
people to just make a post, but why do we need two buttons on the
dashboard to do this, again with two different text values?

There are a few gazillions plugin coders who are going to be very
depressed when they'll have to update all their plugins because the
interface changed *again* ...

Yeah, that wasn't supposed to show up. The code might have been reverted 
or something. I don't think a 502 error is something you can recover 
from. I will say that the more people test the HTTP API before 2.7 is 
released, the less people who will be surprised by the change.

Can you tell me if you had WP_DEBUG enabled, because that will tell me 
what transport you are using. I think I will add some code that prints 
out which transport is being used, so that it is easier to find out. I 
also think that some sort of error should be given to the user, so that 
they know that it failed, depending on what is going on at the time.

I think it would be fun to document the new administration panels and as 
soon as the merges are finished, I think I'm going to at least start 
doing it. You can't really do it now, because you risk too many changes 
taking place during the time you take the snapshots and when the design 
changes. It is only after it is stable that it can be done.

Someone was asking me how to use shortcodes from one of my plugins in the
sidebar, and I figured the text widget could handle it (with a plugin, of
course).  I couldn't find one pre-made so I whipped one up.  If anyone else
would find it useful, I've put it up on Extend:

That would be a most excellent idea.  Don't just let users pick  
colors; let users choose an admin style: 2.5 admin vs. Crazyhorse- 
esque "sidebar-based", or what have you.  Plugins could then introduce  
new Admin styles more easily.

All this would really require would be some new filters added to the  
Admin section.  As the Fluency plugin shows (not to mention Ozh's drop  
down menus) this is quite do-able.

In any case, don't shuffle the menus and don't significantly change  
the names of things.  None of that should be changed on a whim.

I like this.

Now if you'll pardon me, I have some pitchforks and torches to pass

SimplePie does this sort of thing, but uses a standalone plugin to be  
the core library. Then all the other plugins are built on top of it as  
their own plugins, which depend on the library plugin. I thought it  
was a great way to go, given that this gives other plugin authors a  
way to use SimplePie's RSS library in their own plugin - without  
having to bundle it with their own.

Maybe something like this will work for you.

Make everything in plugin_main.php within a "if
(!class_exists('strider_main')) class strider_main{}", and whenever
you update this file, update all your plugins that use it

I find this a better solution than rmarsh' plugin library: you get one
of his plugins, try to run it and, oops, no, can't work, you need to
download an extra file. Clunky.

As far as I can tell, it's not enabled: it's part of our trunk-demo site:
http://demo-trunk.wordpress-fr.net/
...which is svn-synchronised every 2 hours.

If you can send me more details, I'll want to work this out. I'm sort of 
the unofficial maintainer for the HTTP API. Sort of, because I wrote the 
damn thing and I'll rather have it kept in the core. It seems pretty 
stable to me, but there are bound to be edge cases that need to be 
looked at and fixed. If you didn't have the WP_DEBUG on, then it must 
have been one of the other transports: cURL or HTTP. However, I don't 
think the HTTP extension ever outputted errors before or it just never 
had a problem with 503 errors.

I'm not seeing any problems as of now, so either the problem was fixed 
or I'm not reproducing the problem that well. If it happens again, can 
you make a ticket with the following: What version of PHP? Whether you 
have HTTP extension? Whether you have cURL extension? Along with what 
page it occurred on and what you were doing.

That would help me a lot.

Will do.
Haven't received an error since the first time I clicked on one of the
dynamic pages. Could be that the first request fails, and subsequent
ones work. I'll try to have the cache deleted to see about this.

Cool! I wish more people would test the HTTP API, but I'm thinking 2.7 
is going to come out and people are going to complaining that they can't 
access services. The whole point of the HTTP API was to allow for 
preventing problems with HTTP requests. There is Snoopy, but damn, the 
HTTP API supports more than fsockopen and cURL. However, I'm finding 
that PHP and the extensions don't always work the way you expect or hope.

I believe that some of the administration pages cache the requests, so 
it might be that the error (like WP_Cron) might show up once every hour 
or 12 hours, but who is going to wait around that long?

I believe Dion is going to be working on the Plugin Installer error 
handling, but I think I might also support the other places where the 
HTTP API is used. The way three of the five transports are handled is 
that the errors are silence when WP_DEBUG is turned off. No one has came 
forward to let me know if the other two throw errors or at least ones 
that need to use "@" to get rid of them.

The HTTP API isn't used everywhere, just in four places. WP_Cron, 
WordPress Version checker (every 12 hours), Plugins Version checker 
(done every time plugins.php is visited), and Plugin Installer (some of 
it is cached). I wish to have everything converted to using the HTTP API 
before 2.7 is out, but it will require a lot more testing.

Here's what I did, but I still have a question.

I normally put all of a plugin's function in a class -- to avoid  
naming conflicts and to aid in making reusable code.

So what I did is this:  I have my "core" class -- strider_core().   
Class strider_core contains all the common code that is reused across  
pretty much all my plugins.  This file is included with each plugin.

Then, in the main plugin file, I require_once the core file, then  
create the plugin's class like so:

class myplugin extends strider_core { ... }

That way myplugin includes everything from strider_core, plus all the  
code particular to the plugin that I add to myplugin.

The strider_core class declaration is wrapped in if( !  
class_exists( 'strider_core' ) { ... }
That way if there are multiple of my plugins installed, they don't try  
to declare the class multiple times.

Okay, here's the question:

I want to give strider_core a version number.  I want the if() clause  
that checks for the class to ALSO check the version of the class (if  
it exists).  If the existing class is a lower version number (such as  
from an older version of the other plugin) I want go ahead with  
declaring the class again with the newer code.

Is there a way to redeclare a class in PHP?

Any ideas?  I'm stuck.

The funny thing is, Ozh isn't answering the question i waas asking,r  
eally, but he was answering the question I ended up wanting to ask.

What I was originally talking about was not a "core" class, but that  
different plugins would have the same filename.  That is, myplugin/ 
plugin_main.php IS the myplugin file; anotherplugin/plugin_main.php IS  
the anotherplugin file.  Same file name, different directories.

I was originally asking if that was a bad idea.  It's a moot point  
now, because I turned to the "extend class" method instead of the file  
inclusions I was originally trying out....

Stephen,

It was versioning issues that led me to separate the core code into another
plugin -- even though, as Ozh points out, it can feel odd needing two
plugins to do one job.

Why did you create a class just for one function?

For that matter, Why not just do
add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');

Poop! Why didn't I see that? Oh well, I guess it's a good thing I mentioned
it here.  It's a little throwaway plugin, so I'm not surprised that there is
a much simpler way to do it.  I'll revise it.

Obviously, this is something that anyone could put into their own plugin(s)
if they wanted to enable shortcodes for their users, but since I didn't want
to change the behavior for my users that weren't going to use it, I decided
to put it out on its own.

Message-ID: <48B0E4CB.4040002@santosj.name>

I'll do this in steps. This should only take 30 minutes of your time and 
if enough people do it, will be worth everyone's time.

1. Download Nightly.http://wordpress.org/nightly-builds/wordpress-latest.zip

2. Download Firefox, if you don't already have it. http://getfirefox.com

3. Download Selenium IDE. 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2079

4. Configure Selenium IDE to save as HTML.

5. Install WordPress Nightly on WAMP, if you don't have it, you can do a 
search for your favorite xAMP installation. I use 
http://www.wampserver.com/en

6. Go to localhost and to the folder you installed WordPress in. Install 
WordPress in the database you created locally.

7. Click on Tools -> Selenium IDE. Click on the solid red circle button. 
Clear everything in the text box.

8. Sign in to the Administration Panel.

9. Click on the solid red circle button, it should be in the "down" 
position.

10. Start clicking around the WordPress Panels recording your actions. 
There is a menu, if you right click that should be at the bottom. You 
can get advanced however much you want.

11. Save the recording as a html file and send it to my email address.

You do that for me and I will convert your recordings to PHPUnit 
Selenium Tests that is automated using PHPUnit and the Selenium RC 
server. Let me know what you expected to happen as well as what happened.

I'm going to be writing some acceptance test cases and will probably 
create a repository on Google Code, so that others can download, modify, 
or whatever. I'm going to be doing this in September, so you have 
between now and well, I'll accept them any time. I'll be doing my own, 
but well, I'll likely won't do it the same way as you will and diversity 
will help out a great deal with adding test cases which test edge cases.

WordPress 2.7 is coming out October/November, so the more tests cases or 
at least the more people who test WordPress 2.7 Administration Panels, 
the better the release will be.

I don't think it is too much to ask for, it is very simple and doesn't 
take very much time at all.

Just a small reminder -- 2.7 is beyond alpha currently, so don't go using it
on a live site unless you really know what you're doing and are willing to
keep it up to date. Stick to just using a test install of 2.7 and you'll
thank yourself later.

strider_core() is your core class and you seperate it out into a .php
file.Now this is being reused by all your plugins, as you mentioned.

Then why do you want to maintain duplicate copies of this file.You have the
core files in its own directory and include this directory in every plugin
that you intent to code.

The idea of maintaining duplicate copies and versions suck.You don't
maintain duplicate versions of a reusable class in object oriented
programming.

Cheers,
Rajesh

Message-ID: <op.ugdn011fk6w4mc@dd32.no-ip.com>

My only suggestion for this would be something similar to this:

global $strider_version;
$strider_version = max($strider_version, 1.5);

action_init(){
global $strider_version;
if ( $strider_version == 1.5 && !class_exists('Striders_Core') )
include 'strider_core.php';
}

Class Striders_Plugin{
function(){
$result = Striders_Core::Method();
}
}


Then a different plugin:

global $strider_version;
$strider_version = max($strider_version, 1.0);

action_init(){
global $strider_version;
if ( $strider_version == 1.0 && !class_exists('Striders_Core') ) //Will  
not be reached, because the max version is 1.5 from the above plugin
include 'inc/striders_core.php';
}

Class Striders_Plugin2{
function(){
$result = Striders_Core::Method();
}
}

The result would be that only the latest striders_core class file is  
included, Theres the downside that you can no longer use  
inheritance(extend) due to the class being loaded after the rest, but it  
does solve the problem of only loading the latest class file you have.


If you really wanted to use extends still though, a thought just occured  
to me: Put your class which extends into a new file, and include it on the  
init hook, but hook it late after all the other init hooks have run, that  
should mean that the Striders_Core class has been included.

Yes, Its a mess.. But thats what you get if you want to base seperate  
plugins off a single core file which may change.

Because of updates.  I wanted everything required for a plugin to be  
in that plugin's folder.

In the end though, I may do it as you suggest.  Unless I make "Strider  
Core" a plugin in its own right, that dooms any chance of using WP- 
Extend for auto-updates.

This is essentially what I was trying to do, except that you never  
actually create an object, you just call functions with the ::

That might be the key right there.  Maybe I can figure out a way to  
load all the plugins, and have something hooked to call the correct  
core file at the end, and then create all the objects for all the  
plugins at once.  Potential there....

I could build an array of each copy of the core file containing  
version and path.  Then at the end look at the versions and load the  
highest one, then load the plugin classes.

Food for thought.  I'll do a write-up if I get it working. :)

I can see the value in this: someone has several of your plugins 
installed, updates one and all get to use the new "main" code. May get a 
bit messy as it will have to support all the old versions of the plugins 
that use it.

Loading it at init or plugins_loaded seems late though, may want to use 
it while loading the plugins too.

Why not add an option with the version number and the path to the latest 
file. The version number can even be included in the file name, 
something like: main_20080824.php. Then when the first plugin is 
loading, it can check where the latest file is and load it first.

If another plugin is installed with an older version of the main file, 
it can check the version and not overwrite the path.

Message-ID: <48B196E5.2020107@metalab.unc.edu>

I need to do some maintenance to move all the uncategorized posts into 
one particular category on one of my blogs. I thought I'd just do a 
quick SQL command. However, wp_posts.post_category seems to be 0 for all 
except one post on the blog so I'm thinking I'm not looking in the right 
place. Where in the tables does WordPress (2.5 if that matters) store 
the information about which posts are in which categories?

Avoiding the question slightly, you could get the desired outcome as follows:

1. Create your new category if you haven't already (or decide which
existing category you're going to move these posts into).
2. Set this category as the default category via the Manage ->
Categories screen.
3. On the same screen, delete the Uncategorised category.

The act of deleting a category will move all the posts in it into the
default category.

If you don't want the aforementioned category to remain as the
default, choose another (or create another) and set that as the
default.

Don't forget to do a database backup beforehand!

Hope this helps.

John.

I just browsed the code.

Standard Loop :
while have_posts()
the_post()

no action trigger in the_post (just the loop_start action)
no action trigger in next_post() or setup_postdata()

Am I missing something or is there really no way to act on each post
before display ?
And no, I don't need filters, I do need to act on the whole post..

Categories are now taxonomies, so look into wp_termsrelationship table

What do you mean you need to act on the "whole post"? the_content
filter will act on the "whole post" contents. But I'm not sure what
you're talking about specifically.

I agree...I think filters ARE what you need,

Specifically what data us consideredthw "whole post" that you need to act
on?

Which is why I said "unless you really know what you're doing". There are
many people on this list who don't. ;)

A good idea, but this appears to assume that the posts are in the 
"Uncategorized" category. That doesn't appear to be the case.

The URL does pick up the default category. However, the posts I need to 
fix do not appear to be in any category at all, either the default 
category or the "Uncategorized" category. That is,

1. When editing the post, no category is checked.

2. The posts I need to fix do not show up in the list of posts under the 
category title. That is, when paging through 
http://www.elharo.com/blog/category/uncategorized/ or 
http://www.elharo.com/blog/category/birding/ you never see these posts.

That's why I suspect some database level surgery is required.

they are displayed.
Some metas are called before the_content, so it can't wait for
the_content filter

of the Mollom anti spam service (http://mollom.com) It uses their open,
public API to check comments and trackbacks.

Mollom uses clever text-analysis to block spam. If the service is 'unsure'
about the validity of a message, the commenter will get a auto generated
safe CAPTCHA message. The main idea behind Mollom is to put the moderation
queue out of the equation in order to relieve the site administrator of
loads of control work. To be honest, I was a bit sceptic, but since I've
been developing this plugin and got acquinted with the service, it has been
performing very strong on my own blog. They claim to block 99.7% of all spam
messages and it seems to live up to it's reputation.

So far, I've been developing this plugin since april. It's currently in
public beta (version 0.6.0) Maybe you should give it a try. I'm keen to
receive feedback!

Thanks,

Matthias Vandermaesen

Hey everybody!

Quick question I'm not getting answered in the forums: I'm creating a site
for a band that already has a ton of pictures, video and music on their old
site that they'd like to maintain.  In order for that content to be
available to place into posts or elsewhere, they're going to need them to
be associated with an attachment post, as I understand it (haven't really
played around with WP's CMS stuff).

So, what I've done is: I placed them all in /wp-content/uploads/2008/08. 
Now, I need a way to create a batch file that will read all these files and
create posts to associate them with.  The trouble is that I'm finding that
creating a post in WP is a lot more complex than I'd thought.  There isn't
really a simple wp_create_post like there is a wp_create_user function.

Or am I wrong?  Can anyone point me in the right direction to get this ball
rolling?

Have you considered using XML-RPC to upload the media files and
to create the posts?  When you upload media via XML-RPC, WordPress
will tell you where it put it, so you can then easily create the
post that references it.  Just upload the media files first and
then upload the post itself via XML-RPC.

Best regards,

Your theme call one of your functions in the loop immediately after  
the_post() and modify the posts in the $wp_query object. You could  
also do the same thing at the template redirect action hook.

What, what? Someone asked for nosy and snoopy unauthoritive comments? 
Sounds like a job for me!

A few comments & suggestions:

- you got the translation thing wrong. It's not _e('string'), it's 
_e('string', 'domain') after you've load_plugin_textdomain('domain', 
$path_to_mo_file)

- I personally hate when plugins add 15 rows in wp_options when one is 
enough. Instead of add_option('mollom_this',$molthis) and 
add_option('mollom_that',$molthat), why not 
add_option(array('mollom_this'=>$molthis,'mollom_that'=>$molthat))? Much 
cleaner on the DB.
More on that: <
http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/07/consolidate-options-with-arrays/>

- upon activation edit-comments.php?page=mollommanage spits "Warning: 
Division by zero on line 317" like mad.

- I don't see the point of the subpage under "Plugins" (with the same 
division by zero mayhem, obviously)

- the default message when a message is refused for lack of configuration 
should not be "You haven't configured Mollom yet! Per the website's 
policy. We could not process your comment.", it should be something like 
"The site admin blabla and your comment blabla". Potentially less 
confusing for commenters who might think "wtf i didn't configure what??"

- I'm not sure the "remove settings upon deactivation" thing is a good 
idea: deactivation != uninstall, and deactivation happens a lot (auto 
updating the plugin, deactivating plugins prior to upgrading WP, etc...). 
As this option is on by default, this is going to confuse & upset a few 
who'll lost everything quite often.
I'd suggest a manual "Remove everything from DB" button that would be 
pressed when the user wants to uninstall, as well as some complying to the 
upcoming 2.7 uninstall feature.
More on that: 
<http://www.santosj.name/general/wordpress-27-plugin-uninstall-methods/>

- Since you have a cool logo & favicon, I'd suggest adding something like:
add_filter('ozh_adminmenu_icon', 'mollom_icon')
function mollom_icon($hook) {
if ($hook == 'mollommanage' || $hook == 'mollom-key-config')
        return $url_to_local_copy_of_favicon.png;
return $hook;
}
That would be very cute with the awesomely awesome Ozh' Admin Drop Down 
Menu ;)
More on that: <
http://planetozh.com/blog/2008/08/admin-drop-down-menu-more-goodness-an-api/>

- I don't get why anti spam plugins insist on creating their own table. Or 
is WP missing a comments_meta table?
Is there nothing you can do with columns 'comment_karma' which is unused 
AFAIK or 'comment_approved', like storing custom values like 
'mollom_unsure' ?
There's no deep thinking behind this comment, I admit it, but I find it 
strange that every plugin needs a table where Akismet doesnt.

- I'd split the plugin in various files and conditionally include them: 
nothing at all should load when someone is viewing a public page, the 
require('class-IXR.php') should occur only when a comment has been 
submitted, the whole captcha stuff should load only if a captcha is 
needed, etc...

- Similarly but more importantly to me, most of the plugin should not load 
"if (is_admin())": unless you consider that a blog owner is a potential 
spammer for their own blog, your plugin will eventually conflict with 
plugins that allow them to reply to comments from within the admin 
interface.

All in all and despite my rather numerous comments, this is a plugin I 
like. Much much much muuuuch cleaner than Defensio who, regardless of how 
efficient it is, is really messy. I'm going to give mollom a try (when you 
group all the options into a single DB entry, that is :)

Cheers,

Ozh

I'm not a huge fan of this approach. While it makes sense in specific
cases where you need all the options all the time, for some of the
more complex plugins, where you only need some of the options at some
times, it makes more sense to separate them out.

What's more, consolidating the options into arrays doesn't really buy
you anything (except easy cleanup) *if* you use the autoload parameter
correctly. Calling get_option a dozen times results in no extra
database hits whatsoever, if you have those options set to autoload.
Because then they're already in the object cache.

What bugs me more is that most plugins use add_option or update_option
without specifying "no" for the autoload parameter (which defaults to
yes), even though they don't need their option to load on every page.

Look closer at the wp_insert_attachment function. wp-includes/post.php.

Use a filter on "the_posts". This filter gets called when all the
posts are pulled from the database, before anything is displayed. It's
an array of all the posts, you can do as you like with them at that
point.

Message-ID: <3DE1C802-B580-421D-9BC0-416A650BDB35@striderweb.com>

I have a WP test setup on my own computer.  What is striderweb.com on  
the web is duplicated as striderweb.local on my computer.

I frequently do a backup of my live site's database, and then import  
it into the local setup so I can test directly.  After I've done this,  
"siteurl" in the database is still striderweb.com, so in wp-config.php  
I define WP_SITEURL as "http://striderweb.local".  I've also defined  
WP_SITEHOME.

The permalinks on the main page are correct, but when I click on one,  
I am redirected to the post on striderweb.com.  If I copy the .local  
link and past in a new browser window, it's redirected.

This ONLY happens with posts; not pages.  If I click a page link, it  
comes up correctly on .local

What could be going on here?  Somehow WP is insisting on redirecting  
me to the live site in spite of WP_SITEURL.

(This is WP 2.6.1)

Thanks for the help, guys.  Otto, looks like the function you pointed out
is the way to go, thanks!

Kimmo, thanks for the help!  Looks like what you suggested might work,
also, if this function doesn't do the trick.

Correction.  I do indeed have WP-HOME defined

define('WP_SITEURL', 'http://striderweb.local:8888');
define('WP_HOME', 'http://striderweb.local:8888');

(The 8888 ports are what MAMP goes through.)

This might not be a solution but I had a real pain when I changed the
domain name of my blog a while back. the `guid` column in wp_posts
always contained the original URL, and this caused weird things to
happen - most noticeably was that none of the images in my posts were
served correctly anymore. I had to manually update all of those
records.

I was so frustrated from having to do that that I didn't even bother
trying to find out what the `guid` was actually for or why it was
causing the problem I noticed.

Maybe this is somehow related?

I'm not sure about posts, but for attachments, GUID is pretty
critical.  It's almost always preferable to do a find and replace on
your SQL dump before importing it ( replacing 'striderweb.com' with
'striderweb.local')

I'd recommend flushing the rewrite rules. It _may_ help.

The GUID field should not be used as a URL anywhere in the whole of
WordPress. The fact that it is a URL is only coincidental.

All the GUID field should be is a globally unique identifier. That's
it. The URL is good for this because it will be unique across all
blogs everywhere in the world. Admittedly, I prefer to use a real UUID
in my designs, but the URL works just as well.

So why did changing this to my new URL suddenly make the images work?
If it's just being used as a UUID, I wouldn't think that would be the
case.

Well, the most obvious answer would be that it didn't, and you are mistaken. :)

However, I'd say that depending on how exactly you changed those
records, you may have also changed the real places where the links to
your attached images live. Namely, the img tags in the post content
and in the postmeta table (for the attachments and links to the images
from there).

Argh!

function wp_get_attachment_url( $post_id = 0 ) {
	$post_id = (int) $post_id;
	if ( !$post =& get_post( $post_id ) )
		return false;

	$url = get_the_guid( $post->ID );

	if ( 'attachment' != $post->post_type || !$url )
		return false;

	return apply_filters( 'wp_get_attachment_url', $url, $post->ID );
}

Choose one:

1) 'Cuz someone accepted a stupid, stupid patch
2) Because the true intent of GUID is not well documented

Following the previous email, I looked in my own database.  My GUIDs  
vary between "pretty" permalinks and non-pretty (e.g. ?p=76 ) links.

It occurs to me that the pretty permalink is not a very good permanent  
ID for use as you describe, as permalinks can change. If the GUID is  
meant to be a permanent unique ID, it should probably be the "real"  
URL with the GET info.

Anyway, I'll see if a similar issue is causing my problem...

Stephen

+1 on NOT changing "Design" to "Templates".

Remember, many, many people who use WordPress to post content have  
*no* idea how to install or configure WP. I build sites all the time  
for clients who have no idea how to do what they hired me to do. I  
teach them what they need to know to post and edit content.

My favorite thing about the WP 2.5 redesign was that it made the admin  
area much friendlier to people who are afraid of computer technology.  
Anyone can see the "design" button and know what it means.

"Templates" is very unfriendly. Most of my clients have no idea what a  
template is. They don't understand that the content goes into a  
database and that the pages are dynamically generated. They think the  
web is a brochure rack.... to them it's: What the heck is a template?  
Like a stencil for painting rocking horses on your baby's wall? What's  
that have to do with my website...... wha? OMG this is so hard! I'm  
going to break it!


Please don't go backwards by replacing the normal-people friendly  
things that Happy Cog (and their usability research) did with geek- 
centric concepts that scare most people.

Please, please, please remember that people who build sites from the  
command line and code in php have an entirely different experience of  
computing than 95% of people who use the web. And we want those  
massive of people using WordPress.

"Utilities"? SAME THING! Don't replace the simple-and-friendly with  
the technically-more-descriptive. I will be intensely disappointed  
with WordPress / Automattic if this happens.

I'd like to comment more on the proposed 2.7 design ? but I can't.  
Why? Because I'm not a SVN/ command line geek. I install sites via  
drag and drop, so I haven't seen 2.7 (just read emails about it). Do  
realize all your initial feedback is coming from developers... not  
from designers.

The GUID is just there for things like the RSS feed that need to be able to
tell readers if a post is new or not regardless of a change in the URL,
title, content, etc.

WordPress uses the post IDs internally and I don't believe touches the GUID
for anything URL related. Just look at get_permalink().

Otto proved that wrong:

function wp_get_attachment_url( $post_id = 0 ) {
	$post_id = (int) $post_id;
	if ( !$post =& get_post( $post_id ) )
		return false;

	$url = get_the_guid( $post->ID );

	if ( 'attachment' != $post->post_type || !$url )
		return false;

	return apply_filters( 'wp_get_attachment_url', $url, $post->ID );

I posted this in the forums, but got no response. If there's a better 
than here to ask, let me know.


"I'm looking for a plain text editor plug-in, with the same text-only 
editing such a TextPad, or Windows notepad.

By plain text, I mean wysiwyg for text. No embedded formatting codes, 
no etc bold/underscore, no visual/code editing modes.

The end-of-line code must be Unix style, not Windows/DOS style."

This is the heart of the discussion.  Imagine sitting down with your  
mother (or grandmother) and showing them how to make a blog using  
WordPress.  Which set of links will they understand better?  Which  
will intimidate them less?

Again, I really do like the concept (by another commenter) that we  
make the admin interface skinnable.  Leave the default as it is, and  
make the CrazyHorse stuff a plugin.

You cqn download the nightly as a .zip ... somewhere.  The heck if I  
can find the link though.  (Why is this link so hard to find on the WP  
site?  It should be linked from here: <http://wordpress.org/download/nightly/ 
 > )

Here it is.  Scroll to the bottom for the download link:

I see, sorry, I thought when you said you wanted to move all the
uncategorized posts that they were in the 'Uncategorized' category :-)

Check out Ryan's post
<http://boren.nu/archives/2007/08/26/wordpress-23-taxonomy-schema/>
for a good explanation of the taxonomy schema.

Have a look at my plugin:
Add From Server: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-from-server/
You'll need to open the post, Open the media dialogue, Select "Add from  
server", Select which files need to be assoc. with that post, Then rinse  
and repeat with the other posts files.
(Or you could just import them all not assoc. with any particular post,  
But doing so you loose the gallery functionality of WP and the attachments  
would no longer be assoc. with that post. ie site/attachment/blah/ instead  
of /site/post-name/attachment/blah/)

Just a note:
The plugin deactivation hook is NOT called during plugin upgrades, even  
though the plugin gets deactivated, Thats to workaround plugins which  
clear setting on deactivation, or spit out a HTML message of "Are you sure  
you wish to remove settings as well blah blah blah"

Actually it's much older than that, almost three years:
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2921

It would be a waste of time to recall the discussions between Matt,
Ryan, and myself about the schema and logic. We reasoned it out and
this is what we came up with. It worked in the context of
1.6-ALPHA-2-still-dont-use and it works today under almost all
circumstances.

Anyone who would like to remove GUID dependence and codify the upgrade
logic has my blessing.

I've worked out a system for versioning common plugin code.  Each  
plugin has its own copy of the common code file.  System checks them  
all, finds the highest version, and loads that file, then loads the  
plugins that use it.  Details below...

Okay, I've got something working, but it needs some polish.  Here's  
how it works:

1) Plugin file is loaded.  This file is very simple:
* Plugin Headers
* adds path to secondary plugin file (containing the plugin's real  
code) to $strider_core_plugins[] array
* calls its copy of strider_core.php

2) strider_core.php loads.
* if( ! function_exists('load_strider_core') && !  
$strider_core_version && ! class_exists( 'strider_core' )  ) ... it  
creates the strider_core class.  This will be false at this point --  
no class is created.
* if( ! function_exists('load_strider_core') ) creates that function  
and adds it as a hook to plugins_loaded.  Thus this file is created  
only once and hooked only once.
* Adds current strider_core __FILE__ and version to  
$strider_core_version[]

3) Repeat 1 and 2 for each plugin using strider_core

4) Upon plugins_loaded, runs load_strider_core(), which...
* loops through $strider_core_version[], finds the core file with the  
highest version.
* sets $strider_core_version[] to null
* loads chosen strider_core file.  Look at the first if() in step 2  
above.  Now that $strider_core_version is null, it creates the  
strider_core class.
* Loop through $strider_core_plugins[] and include all the "real"  
plugin files....

Here's my question:

Does plugins_loaded run immediately after all the plugins are loaded?   
Is there something better I might hook to?  All plugins have to have  
been loaded so that we've seen all the strider_core.php files that  
might exist, so I think this is where to do it.

Ideas are welcome. :)

I'll do a more detailed writeup on my blog (and post the first plugins  
using it) in a day or so once I've worked out any kinks. :)

Stephen

This might be a better version than mine.  As best I see it I would  
have to recursively view the entire plugins directory looking for  
strider_core files though, and as you suggest the version would have  
to be in the filename.  Once it's found once I could set a $global or  
CONSTANT so I don't re-search for each plugin.

Not sure if this is better or worse than what I've figured out.  Worth  
keeping in mind if there are problems with what I've got working.  My  
main concern is the late launching of those plugins in the other  
system (on plugins_loaded).

plugins_loaded is the best hook.

Here's the interesting part of the strider_core.php file:

<?php

if( ! function_exists('load_strider_core') && ! $strider_core_version  
&& ! class_exists( 'strider_core' )  ) {
class strider_core {
	// bunch of shared code
} // end class
} // end if

if( ! function_exists('load_strider_core') ) {

	function load_strider_core() {
		global $strider_core_plugins;  // array holds a list of plugin class  
files that have _not_ been loaded yet
		global $strider_core_version;

		$best_file = $strider_core_version[0];
		foreach( $strider_core_version as $this_core ) {
			$best_file = version_compare( $best_file['version'],  
$this_core['version'] ) == 1 ? $best_file : $this_core;
		}

		$strider_core_version = null;
		require( $best_file['file'] );

		foreach( $strider_core_plugins as $plugin_file ) {
			include_once( $plugin_file );

Thanks for that.  One significant problem with my system is that you  
can't use such a plugin to redefine any of the functions in wp- 
includes/pluggable.php.  Dang.

Looking at the code, I'm not sure why plugins_loaded comes after  
including pluggable.php in the first place.  Would make sense to  
include the plugins and then immediately have plugins_loaded.

Ah well.

I was actually thinking more along these lines:

1. Activating a plugin:
- get_option('my_main_file'); This option contains the path to the file 
and the version number.
- if true -> check the version
     - if current main.php is newer -> update the option
- else -> add the option

2. When loading a plugin check if class is defined/functions exist, etc. 
If not:
- get_option('my_main_file');
- include main.php at the path from the option and define the class/add 
constant etc.

Can also look at get_option('active_plugins') to figure out when more 
than one plugin will need main.php.

The problem with loading the shared code as you go is that functions  
and classes cannot be re-defined.  So if an older version of the  
shared code loads first, then a later (and newer) plugin trying to use  
it might not work.

Or... What?  Each plugin compares its shared file version against one  
recorded in the settings table?  I don't see how that avoids the  
double-load problem.

Don't even need to do that. The include path to the latest version of 
the file is saved in the option, so when a plugin loads, it just checks 
if main.php is already loaded and if not, gets the path from the option 
and includes it.

Well, i18n is something that's planned. I skimmed through the documentation
so I know it's faulty. As far as bugs go, as long as the core functionality
of the plugin still contains nasty bugs, translation support is not my
priority.

Hm. I can relate to that. My own database dates back to 2005. I tried a lot
of (deprecated) plugins. You should see my wp_options table. A real mess.
Using an array to save and load all the parameters is a nice solution.

Then again, I can see Otto's point: MySQL can perfectly handle a table with
several of hundereds, albeit unused, records. The sting is in how much the
database gets hit. So, certain values like the private and public keys,
should be cached. I'm going to rethink when and where I call the other
parameters to get things more optimized.

Is it feasible to combine both solutions?

Not seen that error before. You went right after activation in the Mollom
Manage panel? Perhaps it's a conflict with the 'mollom' menu item in
'plugins'. Speaking of which: I'm not to happy with it being located there.
It only contains statistics.

Suggestions for a better location? Can I hook it to the dashboard perhaps?

Well, it's a case of semantics :-) But I like the button idea! Regarding
your earlier remarks: I implemented this to clear out the database when the
plugin gets deactivated. Default this option should be 'off' in the
configuration panel. So that's something I'm going to check out. In normal
circumstances, you should be able to deactivate the plugin by default
without purging your database. Unless you really want to de?nstall the
plugin and wipe all data clean.

Well, I went with this remark:

http://pressedwords.com/mollom-anti-spam-plugin/

I'm not a fan of using unused WP table fields. Maybe they'll be used by WP
in the future and other plugin developers might start to use the same field.

First installments of the plugin created an extra table column on
wp_comments, but altering the default WP model isn't a clean way of doing
things. So I went for a seperate table all together.

I'll check it out.

Well, I'm checking against logged in users all togheter in
mollom_check_comment. If a logged in user makes a comment, the plugin code
isn't even executed at all.

I can see now that this quite a primitive way of doing things...

In notice in the current 2.7 the new inbox has moved to be under the utilities menu.

In earlier versions of crazyhorse it was in the dashboard, which, to me, seemed a more logical placement.

What is the current thinking of the placement of the inbox within the admin UI?

Never mind. I was thinking too hard. This resolved it:

add_action( 'register' , 'register_replacement' );
function register_replacement( $link ){
	$link = str_replace('Site Admin' , 'Admin' , $link);
	return $link;
}

It was for WPMU.

I too really like it. If it's skinable via simple color stylesheet
changes and ability to add a client logo, it's a win in my book.
I'm a professional designer by trade but also focus on usability from
the editors perspective. I like what you have done!

Subject: [wp-hackers] $before and $after variables when filtering
	wp_register()
Message-ID: <3283f0830808270944l6564a88en45f2599361e7ef3d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I was trying to apply the filter for wp_register() found online 44 of
wp-includes/general-template.php and defined below:
-----

function wp_register( $before = '<li>', $after = '</li>' ) {

    if ( ! is_user_logged_in() ) {
        if ( get_option('users_can_register') )
            $link = $before . '<a href="' . get_option('siteurl') .
'/wp-login.php?action=register">' . __('Register') . '</a>' . $after;
        else
            $link = '';
    } else {
        $link = $before . '<a href="' . get_option('siteurl') .
'/wp-admin/">' . __('Site Admin') . '</a>' . $after;
    }

    echo apply_filters('register', $link);
}

---
It's easy enough to add a filter to my plugin and replace the link
text but I found that the $before and $after variables aren't passed
to the filter. It gets the link variable with $before and $after
already attached. If I wanted to take into consideration the chance
that someone has defined their own before and after other than line
items, would I have to do a substr() call or has WP provided another
option that I am missing?

Thanks.

Yes, all the html structure was built with customizability in mind. One
should be able to turn this into something like the current crazyhorse
or customize it in any other way. Changing colors would be the easiest
thing.

Thanks for the feedback.

Very nice.  Have you looked at the edit post page in trunk?  It has
drag/drop, show/hide, and expand/collapse for all meta boxes.  We'll
probably make the dashboard do the same.

"My Tasks" looks interesting.  I might try implementing it and getting
some user testing done with it.

Ryan,

Yea, I did have a look at every page of the dashboard (trunk, 2 days
ago), and I really like the way Write page looks and functions. However,
my complain is over the vertical left side navigation bar (more at
http://konstruktors.com/blog/wordpress/505-first-impressions-of-wordpress-27/).

There are many reasons for that -- mainly the scrolling and the extra
clicks for expanding and collapsing the menu items before actually
getting to the necessary link, when compared to a drop-down menu.

Do you know the reasoning behind this UI move (to a vertical nav bar)? I
know about the user testing in ny and the collaboration with HappyCog,
but having more information would definitely help to understand the
thought process that went into it.

Regards,
Kaspars

I think some of that info will be released soon.  A presentation on it
was done at WordCamp SF, but I don't know when the raw data and
evaluation will be released.  We don't have the rights to release
certain things.

The gist I got was that the left-hand nav tested much better than the
top nav.  Left-hand nav brings more info above the fold, which was one
of the main complaints with 2.5 -- if not the main complaint.  With
the nav moved to the left and less stuff up top, you have less
vertical scrolling to do in areas where it really matters, such as the
edit forms.  For my usage, 2.7 has eliminated all vertical scrolling.
Of course, I don't install a bunch of plugins that add menus (cursed
things), open all menus at once, and go rooting around in the plugin
menus. :-)

Coupled with the left-hand nav was the elimination of the Write/Manage
menu split.  The Write/Manage split that has been with WP for so long
proved to be one of the most confusing things for users.

Getting to a submenu does require an extra click versus your menus,
but we can experiment with expanding on hover or something like that.

The organization of the menus is still undecided, especially the Utilities menu.

Anyhow, I'll try to get someone who knows the data better to chime in.
 I just implement the wireframes. :-)

It's 864px.

That even works in a not-fullscreened window at 1024x768..
So, you work at less than that??! *cringe*

It's sized based on em, apparently.  My default font size is bigger

OK, maybe this is a silly idea and maybe it's already been discussed at
length, so apologies.

But does it not seem as though we're reaching a point with admin design
where it comes down to user preference rather than general functionality? 
We're now on our third iteration of the admin design, and all have their
merits.  I know there's been some complaint about changing the interface
again - especially from those of us who build for other people - and I
share them.

I guess my question is: doesn't it seem like time to make Admin setups
theme-based just like front ends?  All of these design ideas are great, but
why do we have to have changes forced on us when they're really just a
question of user preference?  It seems to me that when changes to the
interface affect not security or nuts-and-bolts functionality, they are
window dressing.  Window dressing should be separate from functionality, so
is it not possible to make it so?

It would free us from *having* to accept changes we don't want, plus give
us the option to affect changes we *do* want when we want them, which was
one of the things that initially attracted me to WP in the first place.

I think it's useful to remember that in this case 'clicks' means
radically different things depending on whether you're talking about a
page-reload click and a menu-opening click. The problem with the
current/old menu system is not really that 'manage > categories' takes
too many clicks, but that pages in the wp admin aren't particularly
fast to load, especially if you have a slow server or connection. AJAX
stuff in general has a complicating effect on clicks as a measure of
utility because most of the time you can load a lot of extra
functionality into a page with very little weight added to the actual
page when you first load it. I think that's what's happening in this
case. It really is faster to click a menu title then a submenu as long
as it means only ever loading one more page to get exactly where you
want to go.

On my own site I've always used a dropdown menu plugin to get around
the extra pageloads for menu items, but I've never felt that the
dropdown menu plugins were easy enough to use for large sites with
lots of users. This new system seems like it will satisfy both needs,
fast loading and obvious function.

It's also worth remembering that in a lot of cases most users of a
site aren't admins. For non-admin users this new menu system will put
everything they have access to in the sidebar and they can probably
leave them all open all the time.

Thanks for giving your own insight into this. The fact is that the left
side *vertical* nav holds only as many items above the fold as the
screen allows, while the horizontal drop-down at the top with even 50
menu-space-hungry plugins installed would still have all those links
above the fold. Ozh's drop-down menu is the best example. And it even
splits them into columns if there are more than certain number of items.

Here is a comparison of the vertical space of my ui idea vs. the current
WP trunk:
http://konstruktors.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/wp-crazyhorse-ui-vs-konstruktors.gif

You can see that the only difference is that my ui has the nav where WP
has an empty unused space because of the site title floated to the left
and the top bar "secondary navigation". I honestly don't see how left
side nav bar is better. At the same time I am not saying that the left
bar is bad and should be avoided. It has its purpose and situations when
it works the best. I imagine an app where the menu has no more than 5
core and 5 sub menus and they can all stay open (expanded) for most of
the time.

With drop-down menu we wouldn't have to go crazy trying to avoid verbs
just for the sake of not having two action pages -- one for creating and
one for editing content. People anyway will want to do only one of them
-- either create a post or edit a post. By grouping these options under
one menu, one of the actions (create or edit) have to have a priority
because Content > Posts can not contain both the content input *and* a
list of previously created content. My idea is to have Create menu as
the ultimate place for users to click when they have logged in only for
purpose of adding new content. Create and Manage are at the core of the
content management and I don't see a reason for grouping them.

What do you think?

Best wishes,
Kaspars

p.s. I am not willing to push the drop-down idea that much, but rather
want to understand what would work the best for both the experienced and
the average Joe/Ann WordPress users.

Stephen,

this is just a mock-up. I am huge fan of fluid layouts but decided to go
an em one just to make sure that everyone sees the same thing.

And if your settings are ctrl++ then it should have proved how well both
the menu items and the content scaled. There is not a single thing in
pixels there.

Kaspars

I am taking about the same-page open/hide, collapse/expand type of
clicks, which to my understanding are not bad, but can be avoided if not
necessary.

Could you please elaborate on that? It would be interesting to hear your
experience and also the main user complaints.

Good point. The Write & Edit crowd will definitely have no problem with
the left sidebar nav. But the question is, how much worse the drop-down
menu at the top would be and why.

Hi, I would like to be able to publish some future posts immediately. This
would be useful for making posts about future events. I had written a small
plugin that did the trick, but somehow it stopped working. Can anyone help
me fix the following code. Thanks.


add_action('init', 'setup_future_hook');

function setup_future_hook() {
 // Replace native future_post function with replacement
 remove_action('future_post', 'check_and_publish_future_post');
 add_action('future_post', 'publish_future_post_now');
}

function publish_future_post_now($post_ID) {
    $publish_future_posts = TRUE;
    if($publish_future_posts)
    {
        wp_publish_post($post_id);
    } else {
        _future_post_hook('', $post_ID);
    }
}

Why do you need a plugin?  Set the time to sometime in the future and  
hit Publish.

(BTW -- before publication, it's visible to you if you're signed in as  
admin, but not visible to people not signed in...)

The-future-is-now is a good plugin that already does this.


   Plugin Name: The Future is Now!
   Description: Sets future timestamped posts to "publish" rather than
"future" upon publish    (useful for Events listing sites).
   Version: 1.0
   Author: Ryan Boren, maintained by Scot Hacker.
   Plugin URI: http://birdhouse.org/software/futurepost
   Author URI: http://birdhouse.org/blog

   Props to Joost for the name and to Kaf for an alternate 1st approach.

Message-ID: <9aa12a490808310745u5c531c87ya735e629a31137fd@mail.gmail.com>

hello, people!

I'm new to this list and to wordpress. nice to meet you therefore :)
wordpress code really does look as a poetry.

I'm working on a little add-on for NextGEN library. I'm writing it in
the form of plugin, but I want to prevent it's activation if some
confitions (installed NextGEN library) are not met. I'm able to throw
an error message with admin_notices hook, but cannot stop activation
process. Plugin does activate anyway. Then if I just do exit; it does
prevent it, but throws rather non-informative message: Plugin could
not be activated because it triggered a fatal error.

Is there a trick to combine both of them. I mean to throw beautiful
error and cancel plugin activation process?

Regards,
Dave

My Automatic Timezone plugin shows a way to prevent activation, but it
doesn't throw a particularly pretty error message at the moment.

This is the code I use:
http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/dashboard-fixer.zip

Basically on plugin load (not activation, just in general), I'd register a
"plugins_loaded" hook and that's it. Then inside your "plugins_loaded" hook,
I'd look for function from the other plugin. If it doesn't exist, register a
"admin_notices" hook (which outputs a friendly error message) and then
deactivate the plugin.  If the function does exist, then you can continue
registering hooks, etc.
