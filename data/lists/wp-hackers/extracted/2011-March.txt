Message-ID: <AANLkTin3PZgwCJxDaDSk_e0NnRpXKUZwYX-uHTPCZwzF@mail.gmail.com>

So this is what I have

$options = get_option('power_tickets');

If i var_dump $options in one file i get the array of options i expect to
see, in another file in my plugin a var_dump is returning null, any ideas I
have no clue what would cause this it makes no sense to me.  Any ideas
anyone because this has got me stumped.

This is real odd, if within the file that I am having problems with I add a
simple test function with this code:

$options = get_option('power_tickets');
 echo '<pre>';
 var_dump ($options['dept']);
 echo '</pre>';

and I hook into admin_notices to fire that, it works, but just doing

$options = get_option('power_tickets');
at the begining of the file doesn't seem to work, though it doesn't have
that problem on other files.

ok calling "$options = get_option('power_tickets');" inside of the function
works fine I guess, I just called it once at the top of the file outside of
any functions so I wouldn't have to do that for every function but heh i
guess this works.

Ok dirty if this is off topic but I was wondering if anyone here haas

besides the obvious have a basic free version on the plugin repo.

Subject: [wp-hackers] change in query string
Message-ID: <004301cbd7ee$4f3e6ab0$edbb4010$@brimosoft.nl>

In WP 3.1 it seems that querystrings get double encoded.

With my Gallery plugin urls like http://myblog.com/gallery/folder result in
a querystring: pagename=gallery&file=folder

This used to work fine, also for encoded urls, pre 3.1 and in many of the
3.1 beta and RC versions. 

Now a url like http://myblog.com/gallery/my%20folder result in a
querystring: pagename=gallery&file=my%2520folder 

It turns out double encoded. 

Why has this changed? 

Is it a bug? 

 

Regards,

Marcel

Having free versions on your plugin in the repo is not something very
acceptalbe. All you have to do is built a great plugin, market it and allow
people a way to download with with payment processing. There are many very
successful premium (only) pluigns out there and to name a few: Gravity
Forms, Shopp, E-Commerce Plugin, Event Espresso and many more.

Good luck.

hi there

i sell my plugin tradematik at dedicated site to do this http://tradematik.pl/

Sorry, this is polish :) TradeMatik i plugin to create e-shop
dedicated to polish market (polish billing services in place of paypal
which is not popular here). So selling this plugin is easy for me: i
just installed it copy of it at site.

Also i see that many copies of plugin are sold not with regular price,
but with discounts which i prepare. I created hidden pages (not
exactly hidden, but links to those pages are not presented in site
menu) and links to them i spread in some places (eg. if i describe
this plugin in some article i mention that if smb click at this link,
can buy it 30% cheaper).

Why not? This is a very good model. Offering a free version of a
plugin gets people using it. A premium version can then contain more
features or offer things like premium support.

I think there is a lot more to it the more you think about it. For example how will you provide updates to the plugin? I really struggle with the concept of sharing my source code with the world because of the potential for people to share it without paying me. After thrashing it out on here a few months back I think the general consensus is that you can never really protect it from determined thieves! 

The only way I could think of protecting my source code whilst staying within the gpl was to write the functionality separate to wp and provide an api. Then the actual plugin is simply a bunch of api calls to your bespoke and now protected code. 

Hope my ramblings are in some way useful to you!

Well obviously in the case that would be an issue.  If I do a free version
it would by itself be a decent plugin, and I would have modules that I could
sell that would add-on more features like a plugin for the plugin kinda.
But I haven't fully decided if I want to go that route or if I want to go
just 100% premium, but thats where i am unsure of the best way to market the
plugin since there will be wp.org plugin repo exposure seems harder but I
think its a good plugin with so much more potential in the future.

As far as what someone mentioned about the source code and people stealing
that, in my mind if its a good plugin people will be willing to pay for it,
no matter what some will get around that but then they wouldn't receive any
support then from me.

No. Not at all. The freemium model is an excellent model and many plugins
leverage it.

That's not what freemium plugins are doing. They're offering a free version,
and also offering paid support or premium features. Power to them.

What happened to WP Ajax Edit Comments is simple. The plugin author decided
that Version 3.1.x would be the last free release. That was more than a year
ago. The plugin page then pointed to a site that offered version 4.0. That's
not a freemium model, that's abandoning the free plugin all together. The
plugin page said this and was eventually de-listed:

> Please note: updates are no longer free:

> To receive updates and support, please visit <link>

This discussion has been had on wp-hackers many times before. I suggest
participants first read through a discussion from December. (That'd be
December 2010, about 10 weeks ago.)

Look for the subject "Premium plugin protection," which spanned 116 emails
over 4 days:
http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2010-December/thread.html

Mailing list archives are a wonderful thing.

Anyone know what the difference between the 'add_users' and
'create_users' capabilities are? It seems that add_users isn't used
anywhere, but the capability is still granted to administrators in the
function populate_roles_300(). Is this a deprecated capability?

Hi all,
We have been having interesting problem with wp_http simple request
returns either a 1 or an error string.
Problem is instead of return a 1 it appears to be returning a binary
string. If we put more then 7 chars on the page then they are returned
happily.

$request = new WP_Http;
   $result = $request->request($url);
   if (is_wp_error($result)) {
       return FALSE;
   }
   if ($result['response']['code'] == 200) {
       // success
       return $result['body'];
   } else {
       return FALSE;
   }
What's being returned
Array ( [method] => GET [timeout] => 5 [redirection] => 5
[httpversion] => 1.0 [user-agent] => WordPress/3.1;
http://wordpress_dev [blocking] => 1 [headers] => Array (
[Accept-Encoding] => deflate;q=1.0, compress;q=0.5 ) [cookies] =>
Array ( ) [body] => [compress] => [decompress] => 1 [sslverify] => 1
[ssl] => [local] => )

The weird bit is:
Array ( [0] => Accept-Encoding: deflate;q=1.0, compress;q=0.5 )

Looking at wp_http this seems to being set and can't be overridden. We
have got round the problem as we are simply changing the return to
pass enough data but thats a hack rather then a solution, wondering if
anyone had come across this problem (that piece of code has been our
work horse for some time so its only a recent thing) and if anyone has
a solution.

Cheers
Tim

Basic difference between 2 is that ..

wp_create_user allow you to create a user for your wordpress
installation while add_user_to_blog allows you to add( already
existing user) a user to a particular blog (not entire wp
installation). As you know Wordpress 3.0 onwards you can create a
network of blogs in a single wordpress installation.Depending on
situation functionality of both of these functions may vary.

Can you create a phpinfo page and link that to this post so we can see
what's currently configured? Just create a page called phpinfo.php which
contains the following line:

<?php phpinfo() ?>

And upload it to your site via FTP. This will tell us a little about how
your server is configured and whether or not cURL is enabled.

Warm Regards
Aditya Sharma

Hmm. Really no idea what happened there.

create_users is for actually creating a user.

promote_users is for changing a user's role and/or adding a user to a blog
(considered an act of promotion).

add_users was never used and is a vestige.

CURL is working fine, and can we skip the suggest to upload phpinfo
functions please :) The hint to CURL working fine being strings over 7
chars long were coming back fine.

The issue is not with CURL (doing a simple curl request also brings
the content back even if below 7 characters) the issue is with wp_http
object automatically inserting extra parameters in the header,
presumably to aid pushing and pulling large amount of content.

Yes, WordPress is adding request headers to say what it supports, and it
supports deflating and decompressing the return values.
Now, the question is why it's not working correctly for you.

The first step is to figure out which HTTP transport is in use, This could
be cURL (but, hopefully it isn't). Throw some debugging in
WP_HTTP::request() and get the class_name() of the actual http transport in
use.

The 2nd step is being able to reproduce it. Every server will return content
in a different way, if you can setup a page on a host somewhere (just a
static document) which reliably reproduces it, that would be really good.

The 3rd step is working out if the extra headers shouldn't be added for that
transport, or if someone forgot to call the decompression/encoding functions
on that transport correct, or if the server is simply doing something
strange and not following the spec 100% (Which is very common, most have
their little issues that clients just work around)

You should download the Core Control plugin,
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/core-control/, and test out the HTTP
transports.

Core Control can indeed show you which transport is in use, but the test
functions are useless in this context.

It's possible he's using the cURL library, as it's the 2nd transport in the
preference order (and he's shown it works)

The PHP HTTP Request Extension is the prefered transport (And ironically,
possibly the most untested), If the Curl library works by itself, I
certainly don't want to go on a wild goose chase if the cURL transport works
fine, and he's actually using the PHP Extension!

Ultimately, I'd still like a external page to test against, as I've used the
API with single-digit responses with no problems at all.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Permalinks Issue
Message-ID: <AANLkTikzg1bHDA5Q_4_zuxqdrMQgFN5P3vv2+NjpPMRa@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have actually ran out of ideas in troubleshooting an issue. It got
unresolved at forums<http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-category-gives-404-after-moving-to-a-different-domain?replies=18>&
wordrpress.stackexchange<http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/10467/wordpress-category-gives-404-after-moving-to-a-different-domain>
.com
It behaves weirdly & only someone who is familiar with the understanding of
internal working of rewrite_rules can make some further pointers.

I just moved a site from a domain to another. Everything is fine but the
category and tag pages return 404.
My permalink structure is */%postname%/* (I am aware of the performance
penalties) and the category base is *cat*.

I have tried flushing rewrite rules, re-saving permalinks, deleting htaccess
file & manually creating it, deleting rewrite_rules from option table,
twenty ten theme with zero plugins but nothing has worked out so far.

Interesting observation is, when I delete the .htaccess file, post
permalinks still work, so I thought it might be using another htaccess file,
so instead of deleting it this time, I edited it and changed rewrite engine
to off. This stops pretty permalink from working. Both things contradict
each other.

When I tried deleting the rewrite_rules from options table, they were
regenerated again. I thought it was regenerated and not that I was not able
to delete it, so I renamed it but I couldn't. The old name would still exist
and the new one won't.

Default permalinks work fine. (?p=34 & ?category_name=something)

Also when WP was moved as WP 3.0.5 and then upgraded to 3.1
On forums, I found out WP 3.1 doesn't support Advanced Permalinks plugin, so
I disable it but my guess is it was active during the upgrade and it has
caused some issues.

So what should I be doing now?

Thanks & Regards

It seems that Alvaro's question never got answered. Why doesn't WP 
make the number available? It could be added easily to the stats page 
visible only to the plugin's developer(s), or on the Admin tab. I'm 
not saying that plugins should be ranked by popularity based on 
downloads, as we all know those numbers can be fudged.

I just added one of my plugins to the plugin directory this week, and 
I have no idea how it's doing, since there are four earlier versions 
shown on my pie chart.

I could do a rough calculation of how many times my plugin is 
installed with basic math (# of total downloads divided by % of 
current version). But throughout this morning my plugin has been 
downloaded an extra 20 times. So now my estimate for total number in 
use is between 10,907 and 11,372. I'd need to know what time the pie 
charts are generated to get a more accurate number. Plus when the 
next version of my plugin is released, I won't be able to as easily 
calculate an estimate.

It's also odd that the oldest version of my plugin has been 
increasing in percentage over the past few days. Did ancient versions 
of WordPress report in to the mothership less frequently than current 
versions do? Mike

Subject: [wp-hackers] Memory size error when uploading images
Message-ID: <AANLkTinLgWsF0SOrns88GdORn5H4apjJ=corP94KmARJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have a problem and can't seem to get the suggested solutions from the
internets to work. Anyone got a hint I'll be glad to listen...

I get the error below when I upload an image through the media library
(either directly or from within a post).

*Fatal error*: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to
allocate 5004 bytes) in *wp-includes/media.php* on line *254*
*
*
A very weird message since it tries to allocate a smaller amount than the
limit, but anyhew.
*
*
I've looked in the wp_postmeta table after uploading an image and the entry
for _wp_attached_file is there and looking as it should. However, the
accompanying entry for _wp_attachment_metadata is missing. It feels as
though the upload procedure fails somehow but the image still gets uploaded.

The codeline mentioned in the error message is
$image = imagecreatefromstring( file_get_contents( $file ) );

I can see the image in the media library and I can also attach it to posts,
but only in it's full size. Previously uploaded images work like they
should, and between the last uploaded image that works and now the only
change is a WP upgrade from 3.0.3 to 3.1.

Any hints or pointers as to what could be causing this would be helpful. The
support forum suggestions are not helping, neither is google...

I'm running WP 3.1 if it's of any interest. Sorry for the long post.

Regards
//Christian

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom post type and media upload tabs
Message-ID: <046d0a86-1e9a-4cbb-a320-d13d48cb9d82@k18g2000vbq.googlegroups.com>

Hello,

I am trying to play with media upload tabs in the custom post type
edition page.

I'd like to hide the library and gallery tabs for some users. So I
have hooked on :

add_filter('media_upload_tabs','custom_media_upload_tabs');

And then my filtering code :
function custom_media_upload_tabs($tabs)
{
	unset($tabs['gallery']);
	unset($tabs['library']);

	return($tabs);
}

Now I'd like to make a segregation between my custom post type and
regular post type so that gallery and library display still appear on
regular post type.

The issue is that when the media upload thickbox is loaded, the
$_GET['post_type'] and $_GET['post'] aren't filled anymore. Therefore,
I can't verify if I am on a regular post or a custom post type to fire
my filter or not.

Is anyone aware of another global var that I could test?

Thanks a lot!

There seems to be a $_GET['post_id'] available.
You could check the post type for that id with get_post_type( $_GET['post_id'] ).

Message-ID: <2036D9AF-624F-462E-914C-4E5F0030E453@thisismyurl.com>

I'm trying to write a piece of code that triggers when a blogger's scheduled post goes live. Do anybody know what hooks are triggered at that point?

For example, when a post is made live during an edit I can hook with :

add_action('wp_insert_post', 'send_report');
add_action('new_to_publish' , 'send_report');
add_action('draft_to_publish' , 'send_report');
add_action('private_to_publish', 'send_report');
add_action('xmlrpc_publish_post', 'send_report');
add_action('publish_phone', 'send_report');
add_action('publish_post', 'send_report');

I'd tried with:

add_action('pending_to_publish', 'send_report');

but it doesn't seem to trigger, can anybody suggest another hook or method that would trigger when a scheduled post goes live?

c.

you can use the 'transition_post_status' hook.

function filter_action_transition_post_status( $new_status, $old_status, 
$post )
{
	if( 'publish' == $new_status && 'future' == $old_status )
	{
		// do something
	}
}
add_action('transition_post_status', 
'filter_action_transition_post_status', 10, 3);

Here's what gets trigged in wp_transition_post_status():

do_action('transition_post_status', $new_status, $old_status, $post);
do_action("{$old_status}_to_{$new_status}", $post);
 do_action("{$new_status}_{$post->post_type}", $post->ID, $post);

You're specifically looking for future_to_publish.

Because of the inconsistencies in reporting and aggregation, it's not
reliable to keep (or especially display) anything beyond percentages which
are normalized over a time period.

I'm liking 3.1's automatic handling of custom post type archive pages, but two issues:

1) The only way to add these listings to menus seems to be via a custom link.

2) Consequently, there's no indication in the menu that you're on a current post type page, or ancestry when looking at one of the individual custom post type items.

Has anyone else run into this issue, and if so, figured out a way to work around it?

Thanks,
Josh

Correct on both counts. This was low priority, and only one developer really
did any work on CPT archives. I'd like to see it implemented in 3.2 but
there needs to be dev buy-in for it to happen.

Still have to use custom link at the moment, but you can get the
indications. See:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/3014/highlighting-wp-nav-menu-ancestor-class-w-o-children-in-nav-structure/

I ended up using the description instead of title (didn't like the tooltip),
but it works great for individual items and using the current_page_parent
class. I haven't used it for a proper CPT archive yet (sticking to a
shortcode in a page for the moment for another reason), but I would think it
would work just the same.

>>The only way to add these listings to menus seems to be via a custom link.<<

Interesting.  Maybe I have it as a workaround?  I dunno.  All I know is, I'm working on a site right now where I'm using custom post types quite heavily.  They are showing up in my Menu settings because I have:

'show_in_nav_menus' => true, // before 3.1.x
'show_in_menu' => true, // for 3.1.x

in my "register_post_type" call.  I can link to my custom post type category or tag archives (or even individual posts), and I have a custom post type archive page created that shows up in my menus to choose from as well. (Perhaps because I actually created a Page, and set it with my custom post type template file? It *is* showing up under "Pages")

>>Consequently, there's no indication in the menu that you're on a current post type page, or ancestry when looking at one of the individual custom post type items.<<

You can add a CSS class to the menu item (make sure "CSS Classes" is checked under the "Screen Options")  When I do it, it adds the custom post type class to the link itself, and the body tag also has a class that indicates it's within the custom post type area.  My custom post type is "photos" and the body class is "page-template-archive-photos-php" - but again that last might be because I'm using a Page set for the archives?

I don't know - does that help?

Subject: [wp-hackers] $wpdb->prepare and dynamic field names
Message-ID: <AANLkTikUyk0hM2BVR_7VMjQi2ZoFRBy5KDZCiRUVmdRB@mail.gmail.com>

Following from Mark Jaquith's handy presentation
(http://wordpress.tv/2011/01/29/mark-jaquith-theme-plugin-security/),
I'm scouring my themes and plugins to check the security measures.

One issue so far. I have a query like this:

$field = $wpdb->get_results("
	SELECT	meta_value
	FROM	$table
	WHERE	meta_key	= '$key'
	AND		$id_field	= $id
	LIMIT		0, 1
");

It's just checking whether a custom field is set for a specific object
(a post or user - hence the dynamic table and ID field references,
which are decided before this query).

If I use $wpdb->prepare, what would I do with $table and $id_field.
Wouldn't using %s automatically stick quotes around them and
invalidate the query?

cheers,

Steve Taylor

Shelly - show_in_menu is talking about the admin menu, not the nav menu GUI.
show_in_nav_menus is still fine in 3.1 as far as I know (somebody, please
yell at me if I'm wrong), but that only allows for selection of individual
items. You can add custom taxonomies and individual CPT items to nav menus
just fine, just not a 3.1 CPT archive. A page template is not the same as a
CPT archive. Also, the menu item CSS class you're talking about is always
applied, not just when viewing the relevant item. Your suspicion about the
body class is correct - only happening because of the page template.

Good reminder about the "Screen Options" thing, though - description might
also be hidden by default.

Subject: [wp-hackers] User who can only moderate comments
Message-ID: <6E3992DD-D5B8-4AF4-9C9C-301C521E3BBC@tayloegray.com>

I am trying to add a user who can moderate comments but not do anything else.

I am using the following code, but the user can only see the comments, but not approve or mark them as spam.  the links are just not there.  


	$_the_roles = new WP_Roles();
	$_copy_from = 'contributor';
	$_extra_caps = array(
		'moderate_comments' => 1
		// Each capability you want to grant the new role should follow the same format as above
		// Key = Capability
		// Value = 1 (grant, 0 would be deny but we don't typically add non-granted caps to roles)
	);
	$_caps_for_role = array_merge( $_extra_caps, (array)$_the_roles->roles[$_copy_from]['capabilities'] );

	add_role('comment_moderator', 'Comment Moderator', $_caps_for_role );


I would prefer to do this with a function.php code, not a role scoping plugin,

thanks in advance,

Blake.

Message-ID: <5DFA3947-3A22-40BA-BB93-D8CCF5895F36@redletterdesign.net>

I have a custom post type, businesses, and a custom taxonomy, business-categories. I've tried using some of the taxonomy widgets (Custom Taxonomy Menu Widget and Taxonomy), and they include taxonomy terms that are in use only for pending posts, and when I display counts, the pending posts are included. I only want published businesses to be included.

I poked around trac and found this reported, but could not understand if this was actually a bug, or if there is a way around it.

Also, if someone could point me to directions for searching the archive of this list, that would be very helpful.

Yes it would, however presumably your $table and $id_field are
hardcoded in some fashion, or at least generated by data that is
hardcoded into the plugin and not data that comes from the user input.

Using prepare lets the data be escaped properly, because the data can
change and sometimes comes from the user input. However your users
aren't putting in column or tables names, are they? If they are,
you've got deeper problems.

I want to confirm something before I go off and do it ...

A while ago, I remember someone telling me that the only file you needed in
the /trunk directory for a plug-in was readme.txt and that it needed to
point to the appropriate sub-directory for the latest version in /tags.

So ...

my-cool-plugin/

/trunk/

readme.txt

/branches/

 /tags/

/1.0/

readme.txt
my-cool-plugin.php

/2.0/

readme.txt
my-cool-plugin.php
some-other-file.php


Is this an accurate description?  Or should the /trunk directory also
contain the latest stable version in addition to the appropriate version
folder in /tags?

$table and $id_field are hard-coded (as part of a switch). I'm not
that stupid (usually ;-)

I was just in a robot mode and following Mark's advice to escape even
if you "know" stuff is hard-coded. Seemed like good advice - but I
guess this is an instance where it's necessary to leave it be.

Thanks anyway,

Personally, I use /trunk for my unstable/development version, and only tag
stable versions.

As far as I know, as long as /trunk/readme.txt points to a valid /tag/
version, you shouldn't *have* to maintain anything else in /trunk.

It seems a blatant misuse of the technology to me. The fact that SVN 
would even allow this is another mark against it in my book, but sure 
you could do it.

A tag is meant to be a snap shot in time of a the project - in other VCS 
it's simply a label pointing to a specific revision of the repository 
(or specific revisions of the files).  The trunk is supposed to be root 
of the repository and store a complete history of the project's files 
across time. A branch should be a temporary(ish) copy of the code and 
subsequent modifications.  If the SVN developers had made tags and 
branches functionally different, there wouldn't be this confusion.

So, strictly speaking, all your code should be in the trunk and then 
when you release, make a tag for that release.  Strictly speaking you 
should create a branch for the development of the next version and merge 
it back in to the trunk so that the trunk is available to create fixes 
of the previous tag, but I doubt anyone does that for plugins.   No even 
me. :)

If you didn't follow that procedure, few people would notice or care.  I 
check out ONLY the trunk of all the plugins when I check everything out, 
but since Mark's fancy new checkout tool is so fast, I'll be moving away 
from that.

For hooking onto the edit posts screen, the following hook will do that for
you..

add_action( 'admin_print_styles-edit.php', 'your-function-callback' );

Replace your-function-callback with the name of the function you wish to

I'm curious, what's the difference between associating a post type
with a taxonomy and associating a taxonomy with a post type?

That is, what's the difference between using the $object_type
parameter of register_taxonomy(), and using the $taxonomies argument
of register_post_type() ?

Normal usage: there's no difference; they're just aliases.

That said, through register_taxonomy(), "object type" does not need to be a
post type. While you could actually use a taxonomy on (for example) users,
the more common situation is attachment taxonomies, which allows a
particular syntax to also support mime types, such as 'attachment:image'.

Object type can also be arbitrary for
register_taxonomy_for_object_type($taxonomy, $object_type). This function is
actually used internally in register_post_type(), but in that case the
object type being passed is actually the post type.

That's correct, but there is something you have to keep in mind:

I personally dislike SVN for development, I use git.
This is my setup for development:
My git repository resides in:
/d1/development/wordpress/plugins/my-plugin/source

The SVN repository resides in:
/d1/development/wordpress/wordpress.org/my-plugin

I use the normal stuff in git, branches, tags etc.
When I'm ready for a public release I run a script. The basics of the
script:
- Tag git with the release
- Copy the tag to SVN:tags/release
- Copy the readme.txt to SVN:/trunk
- svn add SVN:/tags/release
- svn ci SVN:/trunk
- svn ci SVN:/tags/release

The reason for doing two ci's is I have ran into trouble doing it in
one. My plugin wouldn't show up on the Updated list on wordpress.org

Nothing wrong with two checkins, but you're doing it backwards. Do the
tag checkin first. In reality, you can check in both at once.
Shouldn't matter. But if you do separate them, do the tag first. Quirk
of how the updater works can mean that it won't work the other way
around. Rare, but possible.

the use of wordpress within an academic environment, by building
reference lists (reference as in "another piece of writing related to
this one"). References are dropped in using identifiers such as DOI,
Pubmed IDs bundled as shortcodes; these are then resolved through an
external service, which returns full metadata. After that, there is some
XML->HTML munging that isn't very interesting, but produces a nice
result.

I've added in support for the transients API; each reference requires
between 1 and 3 HTTP requests to resolve, and with, say, 150 references
in a single post this can be problematic. The resolved references rarely
change, so setting up an expiry of a month seems reasonable; on the
other hand, failed requests might expire after 30 mins, while requests
that succeed by don't recognise the identifier might last 2 hours. 

All of this is working well, but there is a problem. It's a development
nightmare. There's lots of stuff in the database now that persists, and
it's very hard to get back to a "clean" state. While I know the form of
all the slugs used for the transients
("kcite_identifier_source_identifier" -- all the ids are unique by
definition), I don't know all the slugs unless I parse all the posts, or
do something traumatic and messy like store all the slugs as the value
of another transient, with a single slug. 

So, my question, is it possible to delete_transients based on a
wildcard? I could do this with a database query, but as the codex says
"don't assume your transients are in the database". I would like to be
able to add a "clear cache" function to the admin page for this plugin. 


Incidentally, I went this route rather than wp-cache or equivalent for a
couple of reasons. As well as said earlier, different resolution
attempts need different expiration times. Second, the same identifier
can occur in several different posts; this way the data is shared
between posts. And, finally, the plugin identifies itself to the
resolution services; I don't the plugin to get blocked because people
don't follow a "don't use the plugin unless you are also using wp-cache"
instruction. 

Thanks in advance for any help. 

Phil

I like the use of transients here. If I was doing this though, I probably
wouldn't use them.

One, I would cache this to postmeta instead of using transients. They're
tied to posts, so it works from an implementation perspective. Assuming an
object cache is leveraged, you're not even hitting the database, but note
that postmeta is already queried for posts in the loop, so you're not really
running into performance issues either.

In this case, you will need to implement your own expiration, but that's
pretty simple, and you've already written the framework for most of that.
Like how we do this in the transient API, just store an expiration time. On
fetch, check the expiration time. (You could probably even do this on a hook
if you want to be clever.)

To clear everything, you can do a wildcard query, or even flush a post such
as on save. But in this case, you can also flush the postmeta cache for the
affected posts. (You can't do this efficiently for transients.)

I will point out that WP's internal caching mechanism *does* have an
expiration ability, but on most sites, this will never get put into a
persistent cache. Even with transients, you risk these getting flushed out
of cache, possibly earlier than necessary. Via postmeta, they're not really
going anywhere.

I'm just arguing one possible implementation. Don't turn on a dime toward
this unless you're convinced. There's always going to be many ways to do
something. For example, WP's caching of oEmbed responses also uses postmeta.
They don't expire, but probably should, and they don't use transients, but
that's been proposed. (Ticket #14749.)

Cheers,
Nacin

Nacin makes a good point, postmeta would be ideal for this but for the fact that one DOI can be referenced by many posts.

It may add more complexity than you want or need, but have you considered creating a custom post type to cache these lookups? It would make it relatively easy to delete all posts matching the given type, and you can leverage the taxonomy and postmeta tables to store detailed info about each reference.

The easy alternative is to just create a function that deletes all options rows where option_name LIKE {$transient_prefix}%, but that raises two less easy problems: it doesn't delete the relevant cache keys cases where memcache or some other persistent cache is in use, and it's probably not safe to assume that all those matched rows are in fact transients.

There are two hooks, one action and one filter, that let you modify the
columns on the edit screen. The filter *manage_posts_columns* provides
access to the columns array, while the action *manage_posts_custom_column* is
used to add content to the new column(s).

The code below is used specifically for a custom post type. Since I
abstracted this from a custom post type class, there are some references to
class properties. This example adds a column to show custom taxonomy terms
associated with the posts, as well as their order.

function filter_manage_posts_columns( $columns ) {
global $pagenow;
 if( $pagenow == 'edit.php' && isset( $_GET[ 'post_type' ] ) && $_GET[
'post_type' ] == $this->post_type ) {
 $columns_a = array_slice( $columns, 0, 2 );
$columns_a[ $this->reports_taxonomy ] = 'Report Categories';
 $columns_a[ 'menu_order' ] = 'Order';
$columns_b = array_slice( $columns, 2 );
 $columns = array_merge( $columns_a, $columns_b );
}
 return $columns;
}
add_filter( 'manage_posts_columns', array( $this,
'filter_manage_posts_columns' ) );

function action_manage_posts_custom_column( $column, $postid ) {
if( $column == $this->reports_taxonomy ) {
 $report_categories = get_the_terms( $postid, $this->reports_taxonomy );
if( is_array( $report_categories ) && !empty( $report_categories ) ) {
 $i = 1;
foreach( $report_categories as $report_category ) {
echo $report_category->name;
 if( $i < count( $report_categories ) ) echo ', ';
 $i++;
}
}
 }
 if( $column == 'menu_order' ) {
 global $post;
echo $post->menu_order;
}
}
add_action( 'manage_posts_custom_column', array( $this,
'action_manage_posts_custom_column' ), 10, 2 );

Hope this helps,
Erick

Andrew, would I be right to assume that the post_meta will be destroyed when the wp_delete_post() is triggered as well?

Since the stats dashboard page is showing percentages, couldn't the 
total denominator be shown? There must be some value stored somewhere 
as a total.

Provided the post is deleted, rather than sent to the trash, yes. As are
comments and revisions. Attachments are orphaned, children get promoted,
etc.

That answers the question perfectly.  I just wanted to make sure I wouldn't

I feel the same way, and I actually use both Git and Mercurial for all my
personal stuff.  But I'm still using the official repository to release and
host my systems, so I want to be in-sync with the way the repo is supposed
to work.

Otto, that makes perfect sense and I've run into issues more than once
(seriously, check my revision history ... lots of "removing bad tag commit"
messages).  *But* the "offical" docs in the Developer Center actually tell
you to commit trunk first, then create a tag and commit it.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/svn/  So if we're supposed to be
committing tags before committing trunk, someone should update this doc with
the proper procedure.  To be perfectly honest, this is where I actually *
started* with version control, and I doubt I'm the only one in that boat ...
so let's teach people the right way rather than trying to re-educate them
when we find out they're doing it backwards because that's how we taught it
...

In any case, thanks guys!  This helps a lot.

The correct process is:

Commit changes to trunk.
Commit more changes to trunk
Test trunk
Tag trunk
Update readme.txt in trunk to point to new stable tag.

The important thing is that the readme.txt in trunk should always reference a tag which already exists and is checked in.

Which updater?  The one that modifies the /extends/ page? Interesting.  
Is this only an issue when the tag does not exist, but is referenced 
from the readme file?

My problem with that process is that it means you have to maintain
readme.txt separately from everything else.  Particularly if you use the
repository to host in-development version of plug-ins ... I'd hate to have a
half-developed release referenced in the FAQs of the readme.  That would
just further confuse people.

Perhaps I'm just slow this morning (it wouldn't be the first time), but I
don't understand the problem.

Say your stable Plugin version is 3.1.

You have plugins.svn.wordpress.org\plugin-slug\tags\3.1\<plugin files>

Then in plugins.svn.wordpress.org\plugin-slug\trunk\ you have:

 - Development versions of <plugin files>
 - Development version of readme.txt, with the header tag "Stable Tag: 3.1"

The Extend readme parser sees the "Stable Tag: 3.1", *quits parsing
\trunk\readme.txt, and begins parsing \tags\3.1\readme.txt*.

So, you can continue to maintain your development version of readme.txt,
without any risk of "development" information being displayed prematurely in
Extend.

OK, that was my misunderstanding.  Since the readme.txt file is the only
"required" file in the trunk directory, I had assumed the readme parser was
reading the *whole* file ... not just checking the stable tag.

This is something that should be clarified in the developer center ...

It's probably obvious, but if you put "Stable Tag: trunk", then the parser
would parse all of readme.txt in trunk.

(I've seen Plugins do this; I guess they must be using plugins.svn merely
for hosting, rather than for development.)

Gaurav,
  Thank you very much for the plug-in.   It does work and does what I need.
  I am still looking for a way though to do it in the function.php area
instead of installing another plug-in into my database.  If anyone knows, I
appreciate the help in advance.

you can take the code from
https://code.google.com/p/wp-user-plugins/source/browse/new-role.php
and modify it for your needs.  Activate it once and then you'll have
the new role and can deactivate it. You'll want to make changes to the
populate_role_1 function

Can you elaborate on function.php area ?? Do you want a patch in
original function.
If you wan to refer to code then ... just open the source code of plugin :D

Hello list,

I thought I'd introduce myself.

My name's Craig Russell, I'm an IT Systems specialist living in Leicester UK.

I'm recently returning to Wordpress development after a long
sabbatical. I used to freelance, writing themes and plug-ins and
what-not, but since getting a 9-5 that's all taken a back seat.

I've been reacquainting myself with the platform over the past few
months, things have moved on a long way. Custom posts. Automatic
updates. Widgets! My my you have all been busy. :)

My day job has me working in identity management; LDAP directories,
data synchronisation, federated authentication systems... But for as
much as I enjoy this, my developer itch needs scratching.

So here I am, to bend my ear towards the discussion, and to contribute
where I can.

Also I do have a question. I posted on the forums, but perhaps this is
a more appropriate place?

I'm wondering about the time intervals for scheduled events. Why at
most can events run at hourly intervals, not any more frequently? What
was the rationale behind this decision?

All the best

Craig

Events don't have to run at the minimum of an hour.

You can create your own schedule(s)/time to run

This should help: http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/cron_schedules

I'll dig out some sample code later if you need?

First, I think that though the postmeta/cpt ideas aren't bad, you are right
to think that transients are the way to go. You have complex but
well-considered needs and other than the clearing element transients are a
perfect fit.

To me this situation implies two ideas.

One is a *get_transients($search_string)* function that would let you fetch
transients based on a search string. You could then loop through the results
and delete each one. Alternately you could just have *
delete_transients($search_string)*, but this seems unnecessarily specific
and wouldn't be useful for as many different things (with the get_* version
you could do the same as the delete_* version with one line of code:
*foreach(get_transients(XXX))
delete_transient(); *)

That option is desirable because even if it wasn't in core, you could write
it yourself and it would be fairly easy to maintain. AFAIK transients are
only ever stored in two places: *wp_options* and the *'object
cache'*(memcache, apc, xcache etc.). In your/core get_transients()
function you
could check both locations and clear them as necessary. The object cache
offers a generalized API that abstracts away the complexities of the
different storage engines, so it probably wouldn't be that hard to set it
up. I bet there's even a function to check if a persistent cache is
operating, in which case you woudl only have to run one version of the
deleting code depending on whether the site is using a persistent object
cache or wp_options. Obviously the code could stop working in the future and
you'd have to maintain it yourself, but it would probably not break very
often.

Another option, really only available via core, would be to add a $group
parameter to the transients functions, then add a *delete_transients($group)
* function that could clear them en-masse. This would make the transients
API match the object cache API more closely and ultimately I think it's a
really logical way to improve the transients API. Even without a $group
parameter, almost all transients are going to fall into some kind of
grouping and it's not hard to think of other uses of get_transients($group)
and delete_transients($group). In fact the more I consider it the more it
feels like a serious omission (i'm second guessing some of my own 'cache
clearing' code and whether it adequately clears transients ;)

Okay, that's an interesting idea. As Casey points out this has the
disadvantage that identifiers can cross posts, although I have no idea
how common this will be in practice -- the plugin is early stage so we
don't have the data. And if the data has already been pulled from the
database, we are saving and gaining at the same time.

Hmmm. Well, that's possible, but then it's a bit of a pain, and seems to
be duplicating the transients; given that "normal" expiration will be
the deployed form, while "force" expiration (delete the cache) is mostly
a development issue, this seems backward to me. I'd rather let wordpress
APIs handle the normal cases.

Looking at the implementation, it appears that I could do 

wp_load_alloptions()

and then load through all of these. This would get me to the kcite
transients which I could then delete. This would break when there is a
cache plugin (which is I guess why they don't allow wildcard deletes
with would solve the problem), but then I'm not going to be caching on a
development system. 

Actually, looking at the transients implementation worries me slightly;
there are several occasions when wp_load_alloptions() gets called; my
use is putting quite a lot of data into this, which is a bit of a worry. 

It's also poking into wp internals a bit more than I would like, but at
last this is only during development.

This looks a bit heavy weight to me, although I just don't know for
sure; I'm not a wordpress hacker trying to make it work for science, I'm
a scientist trying to hack wordpress if you see what I mean. I'll
investigate custom post types and see how they look.

Looking internally, the transients API does enforce "__transient__" as a
slug, and I am enforcing "kcite" as the next five characters. I guess
this is as a reasonable degree of specificity; in the first instance,
for sure, it seems the way to go. 

The persistent cache shouldn't be a problem because forcing expiration
is mostly a development issue.

So ... echo "This is a $var"; would be more demanding on the server than

We're not too strict on it though, a patch isn't going to be rejected
because of it, nor is it really something that's worth a huge patch changing
it everywhere.

Message-ID: <AANLkTim51p=HVgoh1AbLaQ-Cjs-a4cjJ5eaV7qYL7QDa@mail.gmail.com>

I've shelved my experiments with this for now, I need to press on with
the current project and I'll try to solve it if there's time at the
end. I just thought I'd post here and see if anyone's already cracked
it.

Basically, I think there should be a meta box down the side of the
Menus admin screen for adding custom post type archive pages. Custom
post type archives are a fantastic, much-needed addition, but they
should also be available to easily include in menus.

I'm using add_meta_box() of course, but I'm not sure how
time-consuming it'll be to actually build the box. Maybe easy, but I'm
rushed! If anyone's already done this, please let me know.

Also, do people think this is worthy of a Trac ticket?

cheers,

Steve

Literally just had the discussion about not having the box yesterday:

I'm sure there's a ticket already, and I'm sure they'd love somebody to work

Well, fingers crossed for that dev buy-in. I'll post if I get a

Yes, ' is better/greater than "
Except when the string will include the ' character, in which case, just use
" anyway.
IE. "This is a 'test' string." vs 'This is a \'test\' string.' the first is
more readable.

To declare a variable it is sufficient to choose a name, through which the
variable will be identified, and then initialize it. It is not necessary, as
it happens for other programming languages, to declare the type of the
variable. PHP is able to deduce the type of a variable from the value with
which it has been initialized. For instance, if we write

  $var1 = 7;

PHP will create a variable of integer type with the name ' *$var1* ' and
store the value of *7* in it.

If instead we write

  $var2 = "This is a variable";

PHP will create a variable of string type named ' *$var2* ' and store the
value "*This is a variable*" in it.

The type of a variable indicates what kind of data the variable will store.
The concept of datatypes is particularly important, not only in PHP, but in
all programming languages.

I wouldn't even need this -- get_all_transients() would be enough. This
would have the advantage that the search matching would be done in PhP
which would abstract over the backend storage capabilities. This is
implementable, as it stands, via get_all_options(). 

Performance would suck in comparison, but this is not a method I would
be calling often in a production website.

The code is there in get_transient() method, and you right, it could be
replicated and extended, even if it would be a bit fragile to future
changes in schema/representation within the schema (transients uses
microsyntax "__transients__" on top of options).

This would more than fulfil my current requirements and would be lovely,
although it's not obvious how to implement it cleanly without schema
extension. The group notion would need to be in the database, or else
more microsyntax would be needed.

Hello members,

I am Ashish Mittal, a pre-final year BE student of Computer Engineering from

2011 with Wordpress as my mentoring organization this year.

I am new to this list and to this organization and I wish to contribute here
as a developer.
I have already participated in GSoC 2010 under Sakai Foundation where I
created a subsystem ?Event Explorer? [0] for them. I have experience with
technologies like Eclipse, Maven, Git,  MySQL, Struts, Grails, JSP, Servlet,
HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, AJAX, PHP, JUnit and Mockito. I am great with
UI interfacing and web 2.0 tools.

I have been through some documentations and past year?s projects. I wanted
to know if there are some tasks or good ideas which I could work on prior to
timeline so as to get a better understanding of the code base. If you could
kindly give me some information on the above, it will be very helpful to me.
Thanks in advance.

I think the issue is that Custom Post Types were envisioned for use-cases that are not how you are using them; they are for things like "Products" and "Real Estate Properties" and so on; not chronology-based entries like your uses.  And I agree with that perspective.

Your uses are more like how Post Formats were envisioned for except that Post Formats can't be custom and you have need for features exposed by Custom Post Types like menu items and the metaboxes. 

What you probably really want is a "Post Class" (as I coin a new concept in this email.) A "Post Class" would let you modify the standard post_type="post" and give it custom metaboxes. Then you could use the Menu Link URLs like the following which would allow you to populate with the metaboxes you need:

Menu Link to List Insights: 
http://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_class=insight

Menu Link to Add New Insight:
http://example.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_class=insight

You'd need to write the code to capture $_GET['post_class'] and process as desired, but that is pretty trivial.

Hope this helps.

Hi all,

I added some roles, and then disabled my plugins to discover the roles

If they are meant to be persistent, should I be adding these on plugin

Steve,

you've probably already considered this, but couldn't you just use one
custom taxonomy with a single term "promoted", then make the client assign
this term to those posts that she wants to see on the on the home page
regardless of their publish date? Or even use an entry in the postmeta
table, and manually create a simple checkbox that appears on the admin
interface of each of your CPTs?

Depending of your requirements, I guess that you might end up having to
build your own query to retrieve the promoted posts plus the most recent
non-promoted ones, or maybe use to simple queries, but that might be
acceptable.

Cheers,
Guillem

P.S. This is not to disagree with your idea, I also think that having sticky
posts for CPT might be really useful ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Widgets.php jquery change effectively breaks the
	about-me-widget control
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=yVCN6b+AA7zWkS52URHUreiknQbdr9cnvejQX@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

In a recent change to wordpress the widgets.js script was change to use
jquery .live('click') binding on the save widget button:

$('input.widget-control-save').live('click', function(){

Unfortunately a quirk of the way jquery live call works means the only way
to remove the binding is to use the die call with the exact same jquery
selector string that was used to create the live.

Now in the about-me-widget in order to get the tinyMCE html moved to it's
textarea before the save event is triggered I have been rebinding the click
event on save button on the about-me-widget. This was working up until now
because it was using a bind() call, which meant I could unbind() it and bind
my custom save event (that simply saved the html changed the original save
event). I can no longer do this because I can't selectively unbind the click
event of just my widget's save button due to the quirk in the way the live()
call works.

The ideal solution would be to have a widget save hook that worked on the
client side. Is this even a possibility?

The dirty alternative is to literally unbind all the save button click
events and rebind them with my click event and simply check the source of
the save button click event every time it is fired. But this just seems
really, really dirty to me. Dirty than what I had to do before.

Is this the only way to go? Is there any chance to convince the wordpress
devs to change back to using the bind() method or possibly add a client side
save event hook to register for?

Regards,

John BouAntoun

Of course I've no desire to resurrect the early confusion over the
naming of CPTs (which, as they stand, are better as Custom Content
Types). I'm looking less at the word "Post" in the name than I am at
the word "Custom". Custom, as in, changeable; I can do what I want
with them.

Why shouldn't I be able to list my Real Estate Properties in
reverse-chronology by default? Even if the main Properties page has
them arrayed on a map, for instance, wouldn't it be entirely
reasonable to list the "latest properties" on the home page? This is
surely one of the most common ways of including different types of
site content on the home page, and it implies reverse chronology, and
that use of the Sticky flag would be very, very useful. At least worth
having as an option in register_post_type.

Thanks - a good possible workaround. However, I don't (and I'm
guessing you don't) see this as any kind of feature request - types,
formats, now "classes"? No - it's a workaround until CPTs become truly
Custom.

I have a plugin
(http://sltaylor.co.uk/wordpress/plugins/slt-custom-fields/) to manage
custom fields, so of course this is a fallback. The issue, as you say,
is that you potentially need to do 2 queries - one to get "promoted"
items, and one to get the latest ones if there's no enough that are
promoted. I've got tabs on the home page with 4 different content
types to pull through, which comes to up to 8 queries.

Of course caching (with transients or with a plugin) will remedy this
to a degree. But it still all feels like working around a simple
omission in the CPT spec :-/

Thanks anyway,

Steve

I think the CPT spec, as much as there was one, specifically had that CPTs
were not meant to be chronological. The whole point of 'sticky' is that it
is a way to circumvent the built in chonology of the default listing. If
CPTs don't have a built in chronology (and they don't) then sticky doesn;t
apply.

But they are custom so you can choose to add in chronology, and this the
idea of sticky.

Anyway to be constructive: I think if you were to add metadata with a key of
'promoted' (or even 'sticky') and give it a numerical value; you could sort
by that meta value in the same query that retrieves all your properties.
Those fields without the key should evaluate to 0 (if not add the key with a
zero value by default).

I think in 3.1 you can even sort by value with custom taxonomies.

Hope that helps,

Mike

You might have a point. However...(see my next comment below)

No I'm not at all suggesting a feature request because, AFAICT, I have zero influence over what gets added and what doesn't. So it's not me you need to convince.

And I wouldn't call it a workaround; what I was trying to do was give you a solution. WordPress's architecture is "decisions not options" and then I'll  add "plugins to change decisions." It's taken me two years but I've finally embraced that and come to realize that it is fundamentally what makes WordPress so functionally scalable. Sticky posts applying only to post_type='post' is just one of those decisions. To label something like this a "workaround" is to discredit the very architecture that is WordPress.

FWIW I have found the whole sticky posts implementation to be a real hack that at times has caused me headaches because of how often it influences queries when I don't want it to. On second thought I think it you'll follow Mike Little's suggestion you'll end up with a more robust solution anyway.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the input everyone. Obviously from the point of realizing
that sticky CPTs weren't part of WP core, I realized I had to roll my
own solution, which I'll be doing. I just wanted to make the point for
sticky CPTs forcefully, because I can see some of the logic behind the
refusal to include them, but I'm not convinced. I also realize that
every developer who has to add extra stuff to their custom theme
because of something apparently lacking in the core is "not convinced"
;)

I'm not convinced because if CPTs were planned as so strictly
non-chronological, why does this return a reverse chronology dataset?

$my_custom_posts = get_posts( 'post_type=custom' );

To my mind, WordPress before CPTs was "posts" or "pages". They are
both "post types". Why should Custom Post Types include features of
one and not the other? Is it because "posts" were always considering a
distinct thing because originally that's all there was? I guess that
WP will always retain something of its original emphasis on blogging -
but it's ironic that it's led, in a roundabout way, to a limitation on
how reverse-chronological content can be managed.

Anyway, I've said my piece... back to getting things working :)

cheers,

Steve

Pretty neat plugin.

Two things:

1) You forgot to update the version (it still says 1.0)

2) You should really try to get rid of all the notices (set WP_DEBUG to true
in wp-config.php), since most people who would find this plugin useful would
also have WP_DEBUG turned on.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress Hosting: Individual Sites vs Network
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=imUu8C4mWAFNmkK0SXp4OsX2eeowE=6ATD+NU@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, I am wanting to get into WordPress hosting for a specific
type of clients.  Now I am trying to look at all my options.  Specifically
setting each client up with their own individual site versus using a
network.  Having a network does simplify things like provisioning,
upgrading, supporting, etc.  Also seems that it could save a large amount of
disc space, for core wp files, plugins, and themes.

But here is my problem with a network: Each site is unique, unrelated,
unlike in a blog network (which is what the network feature was designed
for), technically I can set it up to keep the sites as independent from one
another as possible, but they share the same user's table and I would really
like to avoid this.  Also some clients with advanced needs would still have
to go on their own individual site.

For this reason I am heavily leaning towards individual sites, but would
like advice as to overcome the issues.  For example provisioning new sites,
I believe I can use cpanel/WHM API's to create a new account for the user
and create the MySQL user and database, I can use the cpanel skeleton
directory to load the files into the site then do some sql queries to build
the db, then write the config.  Does this sound like a good solution, does
anyone have any experience automating w wp install.  For updates, is there
some function I can have a cronjob call say nightly to initiate wp's auto
upgrade?  For just the core, and/or just specific plugins or themes.  Is
there anyway (with themes especially) to share wp files for multiple
installs, I say especially for themes since I plan on offering tons of
themes for my users to choose from, but at the same time I will need to
setup a theme to be available for just one site so maybe a hook or something
to have wp not only load themes from the themes folder but also some central
folder on my server, would such be possible?

Thanks everyone in advance for your help and insights with this project.

Hello John,
IMHO if you're familiar with a LAMP environment you should have few to 
none hassle in developing a safe environment using single installs even 
without help from some panel software.
As an example, with a simple bash script you'd be able to create a new 
directory under your Apache docroot and using svn you'd install the 
latest WordPress stable version in here, then your script would add a 
user/database to mysql and deliver some login information to your 
customer's email...

Using this setup you'll be able to do a safe upgrade every time a new 
stable release comes out, it would simply be a matter of setting up a 
cron job to check for every directory in your docroot and do an "svn up" 
in it..

for better handling lots of installs, you could keep just one svn 
WordPress install as a master and let your script do the install/update 
directly from your local copy, also saving your bandwidth and CPU 
work... This same principle applies to mysql, you could keep an sql dump 
of an already set up WordPress db and use it as your "template".

Of course you should still have to set up some other few things like 
FTP, but in the end I think you'd have much more control over your system.

Of course this is not a complete answer, I'm pretty sure there's 
something I forgot to point out, so take it just as a starting point.

Hope it helps..

is_home() will always give you your posts page, whether or not it's
the front page of your site. is_front_page() will always give you your
front page, whether or not it displays your posts or a page defined in
Settings -> Reading.

It's a little counter-intuitive, but you get used to it and realise
that it makes sense.

Thanks for your insights.  I'm a developer not a system administrator, its
either cpanel or managed hosting, obviously cpanel is cheaper and makes my
job easy.

Also im looking to see if it would be possible to have all the wp installs
access not only their local templates directory but to be able to have one
central templates directory on the server they could all use, because I have
over 100 diffrent templates I am going to let my users choose from, or allow
them to pay for a custom developed theme fo their site.

Subject: [wp-hackers] add_magic_quotes() Plans for removal?
Message-ID: <4D74D0AF.9040800@ollieread.com>

Hello,

I've had a look through the archives and could only find a few entries 
about this particular issue.

I understand that when this code was introduced, PHP was pre-magic quote 
deprecation and so many plugins have now been coded to allow for the 
automatic escaping of incoming data. What I don't understand is why this 
particular piece of functionality is still there.

As of WordPress 3.1, I have noticed that $_POST, $_GET, $_COOKIE and 
$_SERVER are all escaped with no reasoning or regards for php.ini 
settings. For instance, I am running PHP 5.3.4 so the magic_quotes 
option doesn't even exist within php.ini. I've created a small plugin 
(WP-NMMQ) so there is some way to reverse this but it's only really a 
temporary hack.

Perhaps it is worth looking into removing this piece of code in future 
releases and warning the developers before hand, that as of this 
version, there will need to be certain modifications to the plugins. 
Better yet, if you feel that the code should remain (not sure why) then 
perhaps an option should be in place to turn this on or off? Or even 
have the system automatically detect whether or not PHP is 5.3+ and disable?

If it was at all possible, I'd be happy to contribute code to address 
these issues and hopefully provide one of the fixes I suggested, but I'm 
not entirely sure how one would go about doing so.

Also, apologies if I have dragged up an old topic that was answered 
previously, but the archive is rather large.

Take a look at the register_theme_directory() function.

Soory didn't get sent to the list the first time,

That looks perfect thanks.

Now do I just need to set that once or do I need to hook into init and
register_theme_directory on every page load?  I'd guess i'd have to hook
into init and do it on each pageload but just want to clairify.

I recently wrestled with the same problem. I checked the php setting 
(get_ini), and failed to understand why everything is still escaped, 
even when the php.ini setting shows it was clearly disabled (until I 
found the actual function that does it, and some really really old forum 
posts).

Suggested fixes:

1. When you re-escape everything, also set the magic quotes ini setting. 
If setting the php.ini flag doesn't get reflected in get_ini, at least 
add a WP function to check whether this is disabled (or add it to some 
document somewhere).

2. Add a wp-config setting that simply turns off the WP auto-magic-quotes.

I understand why it was done, and why there has been no effort to change 
it, but if PHP core can go through the pain, surely WordPress can handle 
the change too.

Thanks,

Kevin N.

As has been said in response to previous threads on this subject.

We would love to remove this code but we can't without opening up numerous possible security issues in plugins which unfortunately rely on it.

If you want to go through and review every plugin in the plugin repo.
Create patches and get them accepted by the plugin authors.

Then we can consider removing this code. Until then it is not a good idea.

Are core decisions normally made based on how they will impact Plugins -
Plugins which are *not maintained by core*?

I don't have a particular preference on this issue; I just found your
response to be both interesting, and unexpected.

I hope - and assume - that the core team generally make decisions based
primarily on what is best for the core project, and for the community as a
whole. Generally speaking, I would likewise assume that Plugin developers
are expected to make appropriate modifications when core makes a change such
as the one discussed below.

(And isn't implementation of such changes exactly why the
function-deprecation process exists?)

When the change will potentially render thousands upon thousands of blogs vulnerable to SQL injection ? a change for which WordPress would rightfully be blamed ? it seems a pertinent consideration. Pandora's box is open; plugins in the wild, perhaps unmaintained for years but still nevertheless in use, are relying upon the slashes WordPress adds for security. There's not really much to be done.

Well not pull away security measures is what is best for the community as a
whole. However I think since it is a pretty pointless security measure and
will be disappearing from PHP  in the future (as far as I am aware) that an
end of life notice is given which would give everyone fair notice that it's
going to be stopped.

Core decisions are made more on how they affect users.

This is a decision is user based it just happens to involve plugins :)

I would like to create a plugin that forces the site to not show up via to search engines.  I want to force Site Visibility to be none.
I want to change the option via a function and override what is in the database.

Does anyone know where that option is stored?   

My goal is to put this into my development switch to stop search engines from finding out live sites.  We too often forget to update the database after we move over production data,

thanks,

Andrew

There is an option under Settings -> Privacy, that blocks out search
engines.

Just to be clear, I am trying to change that setting via code, not the admin interface.

I want my code to change the setting in the DB.

I can not find the option in the DB to change it directly, and have not been able to find an action to do it,

thanks,

Andrew

The setting you're looking for is 'blog_public'

Public = 1
Private = 0

So you could do something along these lines this in your functions file or a plugin:

add_action( 'init', 'private' );

function keep_private() {
	update_option( 'blog_public', '0' );
}

sorry, little typo: didn't use the same function name in the add_action part:

add_action( 'init', 'keep_private' )

A quick way of finding out an option's name in the database is to go to the
options screen and inspect the <input> element (using firebug, chrome
developer tools, etc.); the "name" attribute will correspond to the
"option_name" column in the database.

Better way:

add_filter( 'pre_option_blog_public', '__return_zero' );

I would just filter it since you want different values on dev/prod.

add_filter( 'pre_option_blog_public', '__return_zero' );

Anybody know if it's possible to use query_posts or get_posts and order 
the results based on a specific taxonomy tied to a post type? The Codex 
doesn't indicate that it's possible, but I thought I'd ask anyway.

Hi Peter,

I made two suggestions to deal with this, including at least adding a 
way for those of us who want to develop responsibly to be able to do so, 
by checking the php.ini setting. WordPress is BREAKING this, and it 
should be fixed (which doesn't imply it has to stop magic quoting anything).

I also suggested making it a config option to sidestep the issue of 
opening up security vulnerabilities, which would be off by default. I 
will not use the plugins in question, and would love to be able to 
toggle this off for my own purposes, understanding the risks.

Here's another idea - some way for new plugins to call a method that 
would disable this for the plugin (you can already do it manually - in 
fact some are just doing it to the $_POST array - which will open that 
security vulnerability - there's something to think about). You could 
then call up a deprecation message for any plugin that doesn't actually 
disable this (this needs more thought, but you get the idea).

It's true that changing this is problematic, but it's also problematic 
to avoid changing it forever, or to even avoid coming up with a plan to 
change it at some point.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Appending Query Strings to Pretty Permalinks
Message-ID: <AANLkTikdd9cmGcz-YtxSS2bhMRmMXy8jBYREuGSHX8e-@mail.gmail.com>

Good afternoon, hackers,

I am attempting to create a "Single-Page View" link for paginated posts. I
have everything working except for one: appending the correct query string
delimiter.

Here's the relevant code:

global $page;
if ( is_singular() && $page ) {
$query_var_symbol = ( isset( $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] ) ? '&' : '?' );
$single_page_permalink = get_permalink() . $query_var_symbol . 'all=1'; ?>
<strong>|</strong> <a href="<?php echo $single_page_permalink;
?>">Single-Page View</a>
<?php } ?>


I've got this code to determine which delimiter to use:

$query_var_symbol = ( isset( $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] ) ? '&' : '?' );


But it always returns true, which results in the appended query string
always being delimited with "&".

My guess is that, because the actual URL is e.g. "www.domain.tld/?p=123",
the $_SERVER variable is returning true in all instances.

This results in, e.g. "www.domain.tld/2011/post-name/&querystring" instead
of "www.domain.tld/2011/post-name/?querystring"

The end result appears to work, but I'd still like to know:

1) How do I properly determine the appropriate query string delimiter?
2) Is there a better way to do what I'm doing? (I generally try to avoid
using $_SERVER variables.)

And if this question is more properly asked in the WPORG support forums,
just let me know and I'll repost there.

Thanks,

Chip

Erm,

Should have used $numpages, and $numpages >1 there, but that shouldn't
change the query string question...

add_query_arg()[1] is your friend. Example:

$single_page_permalink = add-query_arg( array( 'all', '1' ), get_permalink() );

I KNEW there had to be a WP-supported way.

So, something like this:

echo add_query_arg( 'all', '1', get_permalink() );

I don't think that there's currently an API function for that, but if you
don't expect to be returning too many results, you can always fetch all the
posts with get_posts and order them using PHP's uasort function. I've done
this for up to a couple hundred posts; beyond a certain point, though, it
doesn't scale very well, and you're better off writing your own SQL query.

If you get into the habit of using the array method then it gives you
consistency when adding more than one argument. Just noticed I typoed
my original example, so here is a better example:

$link = add_query_arg( array( 'all' => '1' ), get_permalink() );

If you want to add more than one paramter, you do this:

$link = add_query_arg( array( 'all' => '1', 'foo' => 'bar' ), get_permalink() );

wp_list_comments function allows you to pass in a custom walker, but it must
be an object when passed. This makes it incompatible with passing the Walker
in string notation and all the arguments must be passed via array or object
instead.

Does anyone object to modifying the function so if a string is passed in w/

It's not possible to order by terms in a taxonomy, because it doesn't
make any real sense to do so.

Taxonomies are ways to group things together. So the point of having a
taxonomy on posts would really be to have terms in that taxonomy that
are shared between posts. If a taxonomy had terms that were only used
on one post each, then that would make the taxonomy kind of pointless.
And if the terms were shared like they should be, then ordering by it
wouldn't produce anything particularly useful.

What you should be using in such a situation is the post meta. You can
order by post meta, and it's unique to each post.

Dear all,

Looking at the raw HTML for a site I'm working for, its really
horribly formatted. There is just so much unnecessary whitespace and
bad indenting. It makes it very difficult to work out what is going
on, and occasionally what is going wrong.

How do other people cope with this? I know there are a few plugins,
but they don't seem to format HTML 5 well. HTML Tidy module for PHP is
unavailable on my server. How can one:

1. Use plugins to make HTML output from Wordpress look best.
2. Have best practices for programming PHP in Wordpress to solve this problem?

Thanks for all your help.

All the best.

I can imagine a situation where it would make sense to order by terms in a
taxonomy. Let's say you've got a 'home' post type (i.e. a house), and you
have a taxonomy for number of bathrooms, as well as number of bedrooms.

It would make perfect sense to be able to sort by number of bathrooms or
bedrooms.

For the case you're describing, you would more ideally have them as
postmeta (bedrooms->3, bathrooms->2.5, size->2400, etc) and thus could
sort them by those if you wanted.

A taxonomy doesn't make sense for these types of things, because you
wouldn't use them as a grouping mechanism. You don't group homes by
number of bedrooms, generally speaking. You might want to only show
homes with 3 bedrooms, but that's just the way you select them, not a
way you group them together into categories. A more natural grouping
mechanism might be by neighborhood or street. That would make more
sense as a taxonomy, because it's grouping the homes together in some
fashion that is natural and not a specific property of the homes
themselves.

Meta should be used for anything descriptive about the specific piece
of content. You can select based on meta data, and order by it as well
(with either alpha or numeric ordering). The new meta_query lets you
make complex queries based on it, if you want.

Taxonomy should be used to group pieces of content together in a
natural way. If you're using the terms of a taxonomy to describe
things, then you're using it wrong.

Christian,

I am not so sure that your issue has to do with the upgrade. Can you
please try a smaller image that you have added previously and let us
know if it works?

Looking into this I did find a bug that is related. If you are in the
admin then WordPress will set the PHP memory_limit in
/wp-admin/admin.php. It calls the filter 'admin_memory_limit' and
defaults to 256M. In wp-includes/media.php we also set the PHP memory
limit to 256M, but we do not pass it through a filter. This means that
anytime we go through the wp_load_image function we are immediately
reduced to a 256M memory_limit - regardless of where it was previously
set. A bug report has been opened for this:

You're always going to run into that problem.  Some PHP scripts in
particular are written in a way that can break clean outlining of HTML.  For
example:

<?php
class Example {
    function this_is_a_function() {
        ... do something ...
    }

    static function another_function() {
    ?>
    <div>Return HTML</div>
    <?php
    }
}
?>

Developers will write the PHP code so that it's presented in a clean,
readable format ... but the additional whitespace gets dumped in the browser
wherever it's used.  For example:

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="header">
    </div>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <div id="content">
            <?php echo Example::another_function(); ?>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

Once you start making the PHP generate HTML markup, you lose any chance of
creating clean indenting without an additional tool.  Fortunately, just
about any in-browser developer tool will compensate for this.  Firebug for
Firefox and the built-in developer consoles for Chrome and Safari all
re-create the X/HTML tree from the markup.  They dump the whitespace and
indenting in the document and re-render everything in a clean, *foldable*
 format.

So when you're developing and trying to troubleshoot issues, *please* use a
proper debugging tool.  Even the IE Developer Tools system is better than
trying to view-source and debug manually.  As far as best practices go, it's
always better to keep HTML generation out of your PHP files, but once you
start adding multiple plug-ins to freely available themes to dynamic
JavaScript-generated elements you lose any control over the presentation of
the source's markup.  The browser can still read it, so use one of the
browser tools that can both read it and make it easy for you to read as
well.

Thanks that sounds perfect, I just have to figure out how to make that work,
since it has to be available via http, now this is not really a wp question,
but lets say I have a clients wp install at at /home/client-a/public_html,
now I keep the themes at /home/wp-files/themes and I create a symlink from
/home/client-a/public_html/wp-content/shared-themes and point that to the
shared themes files, would
/home/client-a/public_html/wp-content/shared-themes/theme-a/images/logo.jpg
point to /home/wp-files/themes/theme-a/images/logo.jpg or do symlinks not go
recursive like that?

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=DeSitrE0gUY4ypfsF1h5m3XN_3O2mu_LsnwhB@mail.gmail.com>

Going a bit mad with this one. I've used a nav menu in a previous
project so the client can select and order items to feature in a
carousel-type thing on the home page. I used something like this to
get all the post objects associated with the menu items:

$slt_hero_menu = wp_get_nav_menu_items( "hero-carousel" );
$slt_hero_items = array();
foreach ( $slt_hero_menu as $slt_hero_menu_item )
	$slt_hero_items[] = get_post( $slt_hero_menu_item->object_id );

For some reason I can't currently fathom, this doesn't work on another
site I'm working on.

- wp_nav_menu( "hero-carousel" ) printed the menu out fine
- has_nav_menu( "hero-carousel" ) returns true
- is_nav_menu( "hero-carousel" ) returns false
- BUT wp_get_nav_menu_items( "hero-carousel" ) return zilch

AFAIK I've got the menu registered, created and assigned all as
normal. I suspect I'm falling foul of some confusion between whatever
is implied by what has_nav_menu() and is_nav_menu() return.

Any ideas?

thanks,

Steve Taylor

I'm well aware of why taxonomies exist. I didn't provide enough info in 
the original post, and I've since did some testing. Here's a pseudo 
scenario:

Example: post type is music; taxonomies are genre, artist, and label.

Then there are 57 posts in that type, some have all values in the 
taxonomies set, some only have 2, some only have 1 -- all because maybe 
someone didn't know the label or whatever, so they made posted but only 
chose terms in 2 of the taxonomies, leaving the 3 one unset.

Then, on the site there's a list of music posts  shown in a table. If I 
want to sort those posts by any of the 3 taxonomies then it's no big 
deal to do that. I can sort by term name, no problem. The problem arises 
when querying for posts by taxonomy, because some posts are missing a 
taxonomy setting (e.g. no label defined). If I use tax_query to get a 
list of posts in the label taxonomy then any posts that don't have the 
label set are not show. That isn't the desired result.

So I have to dream up some other way to deal with that problem without 
forcing someone to always set terms in all 3 taxonomies.

In a general CMS type of scenario, the WP taxonomy system is a what it 
is, and if it can be used to handle content objects in the desired 
fashion (including any associated UI needs) then it works. And if not, 
maybe post meta is better, or maybe a new table is better.

That's how I see it anyway.

I'd say that genre would be good as a taxonomy. Artist and label could
go either way, but postmeta would make more sense for them, IMO. To
each his own, obviously.

True, but it's one of the aspects of using a taxonomy. If you don't
have a particular item grouped in a taxonomy, then query based on that
taxonomy, obviously you're not going to get that item back.

This may be why postmeta is a better choice for your situation. If you
had "label" as the "key" in post meta, then the postmeta of "label"
would still exist even though its value was empty.

The important thing about taxonomies is that the terms themselves are
without meaning. It's just a label. Now, we tend to assign it meaning,
but really, it's just a label for a grouping. The important part about
a taxonomy is the grouping of posts created by it, not the meaning
assigned to the term by your brain
.
In other words, a "term" is not actual information, it's just a label
for the group of posts that the term is applied to. When you start
treating it as information-by-itself, then that's when you run into
these kinds of problems. Information should be stored as values, not
as keys. The term is really a key, not a value.

You're not limited to the UI's provided. If you want to make a meta
box, then add_meta_box is pretty straightforward. You can put in text
boxes that say "Artist:" and "Label:" in front of them, then save the
resulting data to the postmeta yourself. It's easy enough to do.

Using a taxonomy just because it gives you some free UI is silly when
the UI is like 20 lines of code to create.

Here's the SQL required for sorting based on a taxonomy:

I agree with what Otto is saying, but it simply was a nice challenge to come
up with the query.

I think I should expand on that a bit, for clarification purposes.

Note that I said the grouping was more important than the label. This
is true, but it doesn't mean the label has no meaning. If I make a
"People" taxonomy and use it to start assigning names to photos in my
photo library, then obviously the name has meaning. In this case, it
would mean that that person is in the photo.

But the important thing is the grouping. By using that taxonomy to
label the photos, I can now show only the photos that have a specific
label. Taxonomies are about being able to easily select a subset of
the items in question.

Now, Postmeta lets me do that as well, but not as easily or as
quickly. Postmeta is a much more customizable system, in which I can
store actual data about the item in question. I can pull that data
back, manipulate it, etc.

Sure, I could do a meta_query to get posts where people->Otto or
something, but that's going to be a slow query because the data is
stored as information and not as connections. With a taxonomy query,
I'm not checking to see what posts have people = "otto", I'm getting
the "otto" item from people, getting its ID number, then getting all
the posts that have that ID number connected to them in a relationship
format.

Taxonomies are about relationships between posts and groupings of
posts. When the grouping matters more, a taxonomy makes sense. In the
case of people tagging photos, a taxonomy makes more sense because the
goal is to group the photos by who's in them, not to use the names of
the people in them as manipulatable data. If the data matters at all,
then it should be in postmeta instead.

If you go to Matt's site and check out his (newly revamped) photo
gallery, you can see that he labels the photos with names, exactly as
I have described above. That's using a custom people taxonomy. When
you click the names, you can see that they have URL's like
http://ma.tt/person/andrew-nacin/ which basically just off pulls a
taxonomy query. The grouping here is the important bit.

interesting seems a little too hacky for my tastes.  And it seems to me it
would create problems of its own.  For example some sites would have a
custom theme avavlible just to them, or that diffrent sites have diffrent
sets of plugins.  Thanks anyway is interesting, although while i read that I
do wonder why the author didn;t just use multisite, lol.

I just tried your code and it works fine for me on 3.1.   Did you have that code in your theme's functions.php and if not, where is the code?
If in your theme's functions.php file, what theme are you using (does it support a functions.php?)

If you *do* use $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] here, please don't use it directly.
You need to esc_url() it or any values you obtain from it, as it is unsafe.
As a general rule, always treat all $_SERVER variables as unsafe. Same with
$_GET, of course.

I understand that a lot of plugins use this method, and without it, 
would be open to security holes, but providing fair enough warning is 
given to plugin developers, and WordPress users a like, then if anyone 
manages to leave a security flaw open, then it's their own fault for not 
heeding the warnings.

The fact that a lot of plugins rely on this method is bad enough, it's 
bad coding practise. I recently wrote, and submitted a plugin called 
WP-NMMQ which undoes this, there is going to be an update soon to fix 
some issues with it, but I don't see why removing it is so bad.

Not really, no. We don't make changes like that. Hypotheticals are fine and
dandy until millions of sites are mass-exploited through SQL injections
that, yes, we would have directly caused. And, yes, PHP indirectly caused.

We didn't invent magic quotes, and we implemented them back when they
weren't deprecated. Not because we liked them, but because we needed
standardization. Don't shoot the messenger (or implementer). In hindsight?
Sure, bad idea implementing it, just as it was a horrible "feature" that
should never have been written. Anything we can do now? No, not for a long
time. We're stuck with it.

This is from an email to wp-hackers [0] in May 2010, written by John
Blackbourn. As a summary of the situation, it's simply excellent: --

This issue was raised (in a rather less constructive manner) on Trac
back in July http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10452 .

The general concensus (Ryan, Lloyd, Dion) was the same as what Westi
and Otto have just mentioned, that it would be great to remove the
magic quote emulation but the issues with backward compatibility are
too great. There are simply too many plugins out there that expect
escaped data that it would be asking for trouble.

Additionally, removing magic quote emulation would mean that plugins
would have to go back to checking for get_magic_quotes_gpc() (or a
similar WordPress function) and the whole reason WordPress emulates
magic quotes in the first place is to avoid this. So maybe we're stuck
with this forever?

I think more important is consistency, and that's what we've got at
the moment. Everything is magic quoted, and everyone knows this (and
if they don't they soon find out), so we're ok.

I completely understand that there would be many security issues that 
arise because of this, but the biggest issue I've had with this, is the 
fact that it actually clashes with other functionality within the site.

The documentation recommends that we use the WPDB object for database 
queries, as creating another separate connection to the database would 
be a tad silly. Well, if we were to use, say $wpdb->insert() or 
$wpdb->update(), then the $_POST data would need to be unescaped as 
these functions will escape, again, before inserting. So at the moment, 
we're having to write code to remove slashes from these variables, which 
is then almost instantly undone by the WPDB object which adds them back 
again, for database insertion.

I recently had a plugin accepted to the directory called WP-NMMQ (no 
more magic quotes) and while it is currently very basic, I intend to 
make some modifications and promote this plugin to help get plugin 
developers to not rely on this built in function. Do you think that if 
enough developers and individuals backed this, and made the appropriate 
modifications, this would be something you'd approach again in the future?

Also, as someone earlier suggested, you don't have to remove it, but 
provide an option to remove the slashes, which could be placed at the 
top of the plugin file (which my plugin will provide), and then later 
move it to an option within the settings. I'd be happy to work up a 
patch to come to some sort of middle ground, where the function would be 
used as default, but provide developers with the functionality to 
disable for a particular file and/or plugin.

Again, I'm aware that of the ramifications of removing such 
functionality, and I mean no disrespect to any of the core developers as 
WordPress is truly an amazing platform, but without bringing the 
specific issues into this post, I have noticed a few other issues which 
appear to have come around because of new tech/versions. And as I've 
mentioned before, rather than just sit and complain about these issues, 
I'd be happy to contribute towards solving them, even if the code was 
only reviewed by yourselves and taken into consideration for the future.

Just curious on this (and I'm not pushing but instead just exploring an idea.)

What if there were a "supports" field added to the plugin header that allowed a comma-separated list of values the first being "no_magic_quotes."  Then if all active plugins have "supports: no_magic_quotes" then a plugin could turn off magic quotes.  

A similar approach could be used for other backward compatibility  issues with an additional supports value.

Mostly I'm wondering if this approach would work and secondarily I'm proposing it for consideration.

Well first off it's in functions.php, second the function is firing, if I
echo 'Hello World'; I can see it when I reload the page.

I did ultimately find the problem, the code was indeed working perfect.  The
culprit was a plugin,
http://karmaprogressive.com/2010/09/our-wordpress-plugin-simple-admin-menu-editor/,
I installed it to hide the posts menu, since I won't be using posts.
However it apparently hides new menus by default, so I had to configure it
to show me the menus for the custom post type and taxonomy.

Nevermind, manually switching to default permalinks /?p=123 then saving,
then back and saving worked.

Hi,

I've traced this issue all the way back through the core, and I think
it's something going wrong in get_term:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/taxonomy.php#L801

For clarity here's the path back:

- wp_get_nav_menu_items( "hero-carousel" ) calls
wp_get_nav_menu_object( "hero-carousel" ) (which returns nothing)
- wp_get_nav_menu_object( "hero-carousel" ) calls get_term(
"hero-carousel", 'nav_menu' ) (which returns nothing)

In get_term, the $term parameter is of course "hero-carousel" still.
At lines 815 and 819 (in taxonomy.php, above), it fails the object
tests because it's a string. Then, on line 821, casting it with int()
changes it to 0 (zero). From then on, nothing's working - the select
query returns nothing of course.

Now, if I pass the numeric ID of the menu - it works!

But:

"Given a menu name, id or slug, the function returns the menu items
from that navigation menu."
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_nav_menu_items

Any idea what's going on here? Not so urgent now I've found a way, but
I have another site using the same method, calling
wp_get_nav_menu_items with a slug, and it works fine. The difference
is that this site hasn't been upgraded to 3.1 yet. Is this a bug in
the 3.1 core?

cheers,

Steve Taylor

Well, this issue get weirder still.

I tried using different images (same size) and they work, but not the
original images I tried with. Everytime I try I get the same issue as
before.

Previously uploaded images (from january and beyond) work flawlessly in the
Media Gallery with all sizes represented, and all new images as well, exept
for the two images that cause the problem.

I'll try again with uploading the "problem" images but with a very small
size just to test.

(On a side note. The Web host limits all PHP scripts to 32MB by default.)

Hi all,

Its now possible to test the plugin, its working. The only thing that is
still missing is the ability to translate taxonomy.

If you have the time, give it a shot,

this might do what you want:

tag#post-1867259

i recently used a version of above script for an architect friend
wanting to list his custom post-type: Projects
by hierarchical custom taxonomy: Project-Types
(ie, Commercial: Office / Retail, Edu: K-12 / University, etc.):

The resolution of the images matters. For the resizing process, the
image has to be expanded to full size in memory. So a 8 megapixel
image will take up around 32 megabytes of memory (32 bit color = 4
bytes per pixel).

This is why increasing the PHP memory limit is a good idea, because
while WordPress quite comfortably runs in around ~20 meg of memory
usually, for certain operations it can need a lot more.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Exceeding upload_max_filesize when imported WP data
Message-ID: <4D767E34.3050207@unFocus.com>

No matter what I do when trying to upload a wordpress export to be 
re-imported I get the same error:

Sorry, there has been an error.
The uploaded file exceeds the <code>upload_max_filesize</code> directive 
in <code>php.ini</code>.

I increased that value to 8MB via .htaccess (and WP reflects that next 
to the upload box), my file is 2.1MB, and gzipped it's only 300K or so. 
I still get exactly the message every time.

Anyone else ever have this problem with the Wordpress importer?

Kevin, the importer is routinely a source grief but it's not really it's fault. Importing is extremely dependent on the server, so give this a try:

add a php.ini file to your root directory with the content:

upload_max_filesize = 10M
post_max_size = 10M

That should do it, otherwise add the same php.ini flle to your /wp-includes/ directory and the /wp-admin/ on some servers.

A quick way to test is to add the line <?php phpinfo();?> to the top of your header.php file, when you load the front of the site it'll display what the upload_max_filesize is for php, if the changes you made had an effect it'll show it here.

Bug in WP core? Or my misunderstanding? Hmmm, guess what...

For anyone else suffering from the same confusion, I was wrongly using
wp_get_nav_menu_items() to try and get the menu items via the menu
*location* slug (as registered with register_nav_menus()). However,
wp_get_nav_menu_items() takes the ID, slug or title of the menu
created in Admin > Menus.

I want to reference things by the slug I used for the registered
location, so I used this code:

$slt_menu_locations = get_nav_menu_locations();
$slt_hero_menu = $slt_menu_locations[ 'hero-carousel' ];
$slt_hero_menu = wp_get_nav_menu_items( $slt_hero_menu );

No soup. I guess I'll have to copy the SQL tables directly.

It's definitely something to do with your configuration since that
error message comes straight from wp_handle_upload() which determines
the error from info given by PHP in the $_FILES superglobal
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.errors.php. So maybe
wrong php.ini? That's all I can think of I'm afraid. Good luck with
the import.

	post type
Message-ID: <AANLkTimTPmuq_jCAexic+08OFVAw4R9bgbGAsNSnsoFE@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to replicate some functionality from an older website I have on top
of WordPress, but it's going to require some modification of the default way
WordPress handles post editing rights.

On the old site, I have an event listing system where multiple officers of
an organization can share editing rights to an event posting. Everyone has
the right to edit their own posts, but members of a group can edit each
other's posts.

I have a WordPress plugin called RSVPMaker that has some nicer functionality
for event management, but I need to figure out how to retrofit this other
functionality onto it. RSVPMaker events are tracked through a custom post
type, so what I want to do is allow selected users to edit each other's
posts without making them editors with access to all posts. How do I hook
into the WordPress access rights system?

In pseudocode, what I want to implement is

if (user is trying to edit or post an edit AND post type=='rsvpmaker')
  if(user owns post OR user has group access rights)
     allow access
  else
     refuse access

Suggestions?

It's on Rackspace cloud sites, and I did confirm that the values are set 
correctly to 8M in .htaccess (and it's reflected in phpinfo in all the 
directories).

I also cut the size of the file down by exporting only a month of data - 
200k - that one fails too.

I'm going to go with all those other folks that blame WordPress - 
especially since it's not even outputting that error correctly (<code>). :-P

Hi David,

I've found this plugin invaluable:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/

What you're describing doesn't sound as if it'll be entirely catered
for by the plugin, but it should help a lot.

Past that, you'll need to understand how you're using the
'capability_type' and 'capabilities' arguments for
register_post_type() (if that's under your control and not exclusively
managed by the plugin. I dealt with this briefly but I forget the
details. Oh, here's an article by the saviour who did the plugin:

Hope this helps...

Kevin,

I'm a huge fan of using the Advanced Export plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-export-for-wp-wpmu/ to overcome some of the import problems. I know it's not a fix, but it's a work around.

indeed, that way you rewrite the permalink settings. Hitting the 'save' button will do (without making any changes). This is required for every rewrite change on CPTs and taxonomies.

You definitely checked post_max_size ? That by default is set to 2M, you can
set the Uploads higher than that, but this ini setting will still override
it.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I'd like to replicate some functionality from an older website I have on top
of WordPress, but it's going to require some modification of the default way
WordPress handles post editing rights.

On the old site, I have an event listing system where multiple officers of
an organization can share editing rights to an event posting. Everyone has
the right to edit their own posts, but members of a group can edit each
other's posts.

I have a WordPress plugin called RSVPMaker that has some nicer functionality
for event management, but I need to figure out how to retrofit this other
functionality onto it. RSVPMaker events are tracked through a custom post
type, so what I want to do is allow selected users to edit each other's
posts without making them editors with access to all posts. How do I hook
into the WordPress access rights system?

In pseudocode, what I want to implement is

if (user is trying to edit or post an edit AND post type=='rsvpmaker')
 if(user owns post OR user has group access rights)
    allow access
 else
    refuse access

Suggestions?

That didn't work though, I actually had to change the rewrite ruiles then
change back.

Ok so if you all aren't tired of all my questions yet, I am hooking into
init, then I need to determine if the user is accessing either wp-login or
wp-admin, now I can use is_admin() to check for if they are accessing
wp-admin, but I didn't see any conditional tag in the codex to determine if
they are accessing wp-login, is there something undocumented or something
that I'm missing or do I have to reply on using the url the are accessing?

That's perfect you also managed to answer my other question which I forgot
to include in my original email, but I was also going to ask about
identifying what admin page the user was on, that does it perfectly.  The
only issue is when detecting if the user is accessing a page added by my
plugin all that returns in admin.php not admin.php?page=blah but I can
always gust use $_GET['page'] in addition to get that. Thanks for your help.

$pagenow is not supposed to include any GET parameters otherwise someone using it would have to write code to process them which is the antithesis of what $pagenow is used for, especially given that parameters can come in any order.

So yes, if you need to also test for GET parameters, inspect the $_GET array.

Subject: [wp-hackers] tinyMCE in 3.1
Message-ID: <1299692563.4307.19.camel@rivalry>

Hi,
I have some questions about tinyMCE in WordPress 3.1.

Can you provide an example block of code on how to integrate tinyMCE
with media upload with custom textareas using WordPress api?

If prior to 3.1 I was able to manipulate `edCanvas` global value and
achieve any kind of integration, the new 3.1 js is totally "broken".

Lets start with some code review....

https://github.com/dxw/wordpress/blob/v3.1/wp-admin/js/media-upload.dev.js#L65
Why WordPress asks me to have a tinyMCE instance on an element with
`#content` ? Can we make some checks before ensuring a `#content`
element exists?

https://github.com/dxw/wordpress/blob/v3.1/wp-admin/js/media-upload.dev.js#L5
Why `ed` is not `edCanvas`, because of previous line and this one, even
if I will "init" new `tinyMCE.editors` I will never gonna be able to
`send_to_editor()` until I will `tinyMCE.editors.content.destroy()` that
`#content` instance.

I would love to get some explanations, because with the current code,
it's impossible to integrate the so famous tinyMCE with a plugin. More
important, even if I will be able to integrate tinyMCE with my own
textarea, it will `tinyMCE.triggerSave()` with an error, which will lead
to unsynced textareas, this way loosing data on ajax saving.

Thanks in advance.

get_header() only loads header.php

Try using get_template_part():

get_template_part( 'header', 'photo' );

It might not be the best way to do this, but you could just copy everything and change what you need to the new header files

and replace your <?php get_header() ?> with <?php locate_template( array('header-photo.php'), true ); ?> in your page template.

Actually, I'm not sure that's true. See
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/general-template.php#L9

<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/general-template.php#L9>Additionally,
get_template_part() != get_header() because get_header calls the
'get_header' action, which I'm pretty sure many plugins utilize.

<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/general-template.php#L9>Martin:
you may want to check that header-photo.php is in the root of your theme,
and double check that you didn't name it header_photo.php or something.

you can add an  <?php if (is_page()){ //stuff goes here } ?> function on
your header.php to output what you want it to.

If you have a custom page template all you have to do is add parameters to
is_page().

Subject: [wp-hackers] Difference in behaviour between WP_Object_Cache and
	W3_ObjectCache
Message-ID: <76C62B94-F8B6-4474-9C5D-24A1262A9B6E@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm seeing different behaviour in interacting with objects cached using WordPress's built-in object cache and W3 Total Cache.  There's something here I'm missing.  

<?php
// Add a post to the object cache
$post_id = 123;
$post_object = new stdClass();
$post_object->ID = $post_id;
$post_object->post_title = 'Original title';
wp_cache_set($post_id, $post_object, 'posts');

// Retrieve the post from the object cache
$post = wp_cache_get($post_id, 'posts');

// Change the post title
$post->post_title = 'Hello, world';

// Get a new copy of the post from the object cache
$post_cache = wp_cache_get($post->ID, 'posts');

// Compare the object fresh from cache with the locally-modified object
echo $post->post_title . "\n";
echo $post_cache->post_title . "\n";

/**
Output when using WordPress's built-in object cache:
Hello, world
Original title

Output when using W3TC's object cache dropin, with object caching disabled:
Hello, world
Hello, world
*/

I just don't see what could be causing the difference in behaviour when looking at the cache set and cache get methods.

Ah hah.  I ran through the code with a colleague and found the answer.  I missed it before, but WP_Object_Cache returns wp_clone($object) and W3_ObjectCache returns the original object, not a clone.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to send notification messages in wordpress?
Message-ID: <4D78B065.7020603@lavabit.com>

Is there anything comparable to cakePHP's setFlash in WP? I've got a 
multiform plugin and I simply want to notify users of their actions 
inside a div at the top of each page. Any Ideas how to go about this? 
I've read a little about WP_Error, but these aren't error messages... 
merely things like "Image Upload Successful!" etc.

If I supply a timestamp for a new job, what timezone is that timestamp

It's going to start with WordPress' setting but that's also set based on the server.

The WP cron system uses the output of the time() function as the base
which it checks against.

Therefore, if you need precisely scheduled items, you should schedule
them as offsets against the current value of time(). time() + 86400
for 1 day in the future from "now", sort of thing.

Oh wow, was there a reason it doesn't use the WP timezone since 
everywhere else it is?

Cron events are generally scheduled for some period of time in the
future or on a recurring schedule. The only constant ticking time
value that never really changes is the output of time() or gmtime().
Screwing around with timezones the way WP makes the time value
confusing.

If you need to get a time() -like value for a specific local time, use
this code:

mysql2date('U', some-localtime-string, false)

That will give you back a value converted using strtotime() that will
be in the same timezone as whatever time() is.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Double Slug - Custom Post Type
Message-ID: <AANLkTimvB8uKSxz4S=5Cctcb+Jwj0Wb8QPUJiHtBOraD@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a Custom Post type, I'd like to sit at:

http://example.com/some-page/custom-post-slug
 http://example.com/some-page/custom-post-slug/a-custom-post-item

E.g. have a "double" slug, on the Custom Post type (So the custom post type
becomes a second level item in the URL, not top level).

'rewrite' => array(
        'slug' => 'custom-post-slug',
        'with_front' => false);

I can't use with_front, as our "front" is /blog/ (for the blog area).

How are people achieving this?

Thanks,
Rob

interesting seems a little too hacky for my tastes.  And it seems to me
it
would create problems of its own.  For example some sites would have a
custom theme avavlible just to them, or that diffrent sites have
diffrent
sets of plugins.  Thanks anyway is interesting, although while i read

do wonder why the author didn;t just use multisite, lol.

It seems to me that wordpress internal rewrite rules are always sent to

.htaccess.

True?

You probably could ... I've managed to do something similar in the past.
 But what exactly are you trying to accomplish?  The rewrite engine is meant
to manage pretty permalinks and route them through WordPress to process a
query.  Anything accessing admin-ajax.php (according your message subject)
would be behind the scenes and wouldn't need human-readable pretty
permalinks.

Give us some examples of what you're trying to do ...

Here is the code snippet:

function create_rewrite_rules($rules) {


global $wp_rewrite;

$new_rules = array( '^plugin-api/(.*?)/(.*?)/?$' => 'index.php' .
'wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=test&do=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(1) .

 '&command=' . $wp_rewrite->preg_index(2) );

$rules = $new_rules + $rules;

return $rules;

}
add_filter('rewrite_rules_array',  'create_rewrite_rules' );

So going to http://mywebsite.com/plugin_api/do/something should be rewrote
to
http://mywebsite.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=test&do=do&command=something

But it doesn't every request to plugin_api is taken into account because I
do not get the 404 error page but always the front page. I did flush rewrite
rules and checked the generated rewrite rules: mine is in it.

I had a problem with 404 errors after registering a custom posttype
and taxonomy, flushing rewrite rules didnt work for me either.
Howevver going to permalink options switching to default rules p=
saving, then switching back and saving worked for me.

WP_Rewrite is not a .htaccess type of thing.
Specifically, WP_Rewrite converts a Request into Query Vars.

IE. /2008/09/post/ is the same as index.php?year=2008&month=09&postname=post

It can't be used to rewrite to a admin-ajax, or non-index.php entry point.

The standard way of achieving this, is to set a custom query var, register
it through query_vars filter, and hook in on parse_request(or similar, some
use template_redirect, but thats after posts have been queried - i'm not
sure of the best one off the top of my head) and handle the ajax response
there.

Rob -

I've done something similar for a recent project where I needed the slug 
for the custom post type to be more than 1 level deep. I just set the 
slug as that.

'rewrite' =>  array('slug' =>  'some-page/custom-post-slug');

I even have one that is 5 levels deep. Now ... I'm not sure if this is 
the proper thing to do, but it worked for us. :)

Message-ID: <4D7A31B3.8060506@gmail.com>

Hello,

I don't know if I'm sending this to the right mailing list, but 
according to the WordPress GSoC page I should post here about my plans 
for GSoC tasks.

First of all, I would like to ask, is there any priority for GSoC tasks? 
Are there any tasks "more important" than the others? Obviously, I don't 
want to prepare a detailed submission for a task that won't make it to 
GSoC anyway...
I was considering two of them: Full-Throttle Trac Annihilation (I think 
that I saw a similiar task a year ago, was it completed by anyone? if 
so, what were the evaluation rules? the number of closed tickets? I was 
thinking about going for ~50 tickets) and Enhanced Emails. Any 
suggestions concerning these two? Also, who would be the mentor for 
these two tasks?

I know Google did not announce the accepted orgs yet, but I want to get 
involved as soon as possible so either way any response would be very 
helpful :)

Hook into the 'admin_notices' action, and output a div with class 
'update-nag'.

add_action('admin_notices', 'my_alert');
function my_alert() {
   echo "<div class='update-nag'>Git 'er done!</div>";

Message-ID: <CD47955B7E065D48AB5CF226C2ED75C038D8CD@tbs-sbs01.TBS.local>

After consensus before writing a patch:

 

As I'm sure you're aware - if you modify the main query on the front
page of a blog using query_posts, then is_front_page() will return
false.

 

Of course this is because you've now updated the query, changing, for
all intents and purposes, the page you're on.

 

However ... is this really the preferred behaviour for is_front_page()?
Personally I feel it should always return true if you're on the front
page, *even* if you modify the front page query.

 

Thoughts / opinions either way? Apologies if I've dragged up an old
discussion, did dig through the list archives.

 

Have a good weekend all,

Gav

I think it might make sense for is_front_page() the function always to
return the value of is_front_page() the method, of the *$wp_the_query
object.*  That would probably do what you want and match most use
cases.

I'd say yes, because the same behavior exists for is_everything() in that sense.

If you don't want to change what page you're on, don't use
query_posts(). You can just make a new WP_Query() instead.

I will also say yes. is_front_page() should always return true for
index.php.

I have implemented manual redirection for the wp-favicons plugin here:
http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-favicons/trunk/includes/class-http.php

(part of next version 0.5.1 where a mouseover over a redirect/tiny url shows
the url it redirects to)
I redirect 5 times max.

e.g. (1) nu.nl (301) ---> (2) www.nu.nl (200) --> (3)
www.nu.nl/images/favicon.ico (200)

I needed the manual redirection because I needed the base_href when no
base_href is given in the HTML source.
I then need the redirected URI to use that as base_href

Code is not completely done since a use case like:

e.g. (1) newscred.com (301) --> (2) http://platform.newscred.com (200) (look
in page) --> (3) http://newscred.com/favicon.ico (301) (wtf? redirect of
content in page) -->
(4) http://newspapers.newscred.com/favicon.ico (200) --> (5)
http://newspapers.newscred.com//media/img/favicon.ico (200)

does not work yet since this site gives 4 as redirect url while (4) is
actually a page. So i need to add another check for binary content in the
beginning.

But for all none favicon self-redirection this should work.

No, it shouldn't, for a few reasons.

First, in WP, *all* pages are really "index.php". So I assume you
meant for the root page. http://example.com/ for example.

Secondly, all the is_whatever() functions are based around the current
main query. is_archive() will return true on any archive page.
is_category() returns true on any category archive page. is_page(),
is_single(), etc., all of them are based on the current query.

Now, is_front_page() is also based on the current query, as well as
the front page setting on the Settings page. If you change the query
to something else, then you're not on the front page anymore.

If you want to base something on the current state of the URL, then
you should examine the actual URL instead. The is_* functions are
evaluating the state of the main page query, and they should all do
that consistently.

Two things:

1. Don't use "Http" as a class name. Seriously, prefix *everything*:
http://andrewnacin.com/2010/05/11/in-wordpress-prefix-everything/

2. Why not just extend the WP_Http class instead to support what you
want it to support? Seems like you went the super-long-way-around
here.

But unlike is_archive(), is_category(), etc., is_front_page() has no
reasonable scoped use within a custom query.  I may, for example, want
to know whether the current, custom query is for a category or page,
no matter that overall page's query was, but there would never be a
situation in which the custom query result for is_front_page() should
be different from the main query.

So I think it would be reasonable for is_front_page() the function to
be an exception to the general rule, and return the value of the
$wp_the_query method, because it already is exceptional.

What if you want to allow the user to select a category as the home page and
wouldn't otherwise know what category that was.

I disagree, because that depends on how you change the query. If
you're only altering one query_var, like say posts_per_page, then you
can still be on the front page with an altered query.

But if you only show posts from a category, then you're not on the
front page anymore, you're showing a category archive.

It isn't exceptional though. That's my point. It's just a way of
checking what's in the query. If you want to check if you're on the
root URL or not, then you shouldn't be looking at the query at all,
and you shouldn't be using is_front_page().

Basically, you're trying to redefine what is_front_page() does, in a
manner that is inconsistent with all of the other query check
functions, and I disagree with that. If you want to check the URL,
then write an entirely new function that does that. Don't change the
existing function to be inconsistent and different, because you'll
break expected behaviors.

Thanks for the comments, need to do work on it :)

1)     .....  I DO prefix: see line 1: namespace leau\co\wp_favicons; (!)
  that is why namespaces have been created :)

  (makes it easy to create the plugins)

Many of the functionality blocks are dynamically namespaced :

              foreach ($all_plugins as $module_key => $module_value)
 {
foreach ($module_value as $plugin_key => $plugin_value)
{
 $class_name = 'leau\\co\\wp_favicons\\' .
$module_key . "_" . $plugin_key;

$this->pluginObjects[$n] = new $class_name;
$this->pluginObjects[$n]->Activate($module_key,$plugin_key);
 add_action(Config::GetPluginSlug() . $module_key .
'_plugins', array($this->pluginObjects[$n],
 'AddAdminOption'), 1, 10);
$n++;
}
 }

:)

2) extending the HTTP Class : i don't know yet where this plugin will lead
me in terms of functionality.
    my request-chain does not stop at a 200.

Ugh. Using namespaces in PHP is bad mojo. Mostly because PHP defined
them to be as ugly as possible (seriously, backslashes?), but mainly
because PHP versions under 5.3.0 don't support them. WordPress is only
upping the requirement to PHP 5.2, and as you can see from the stats,
85% of people are running 5.2: http://wordpress.org/about/stats/

1. backslashes are ugly : yes i posted the same blogcomments on it grin but
... at least they are now here. And they are really
needed functionality despite the look. Prefixes are there because PHP did
not have namespaces like other programming
languages. Seriously : ask plugin writers to create a unique prefix in front
of EVERY class and global ?? That is probably
even more uglier than the backslash :). A C# or Java developer would think
wtf. That is a workaround
for simply namespace \com\google\pluginA at the top of every file. Compare
phpdoc @package WordPress and @package whatever in plugins. That is the same
principle.

Without namespaces (the thousands of plugins and themes around WordPress *
the amount of classes, functions and globals etc.. ) = tens of thousands of
objects (!!) they use are in potential danger of naming conflicts..... with
namespaces... there is none (if people use their domain as part of the
namespace).

2. only supported in 5.3 and upwards: I think that is a host problem.
{ many hosts do support 5.3 but it requires a line in the .htaccess to use
that bin dir}
PHP 5.3 ... uhm what 2/3 years old? IF 85% of the hosts are now on 5.2 then
probably the majority of them have a
switch to try 5.3 from another bin. If people don't use that switch its
probably because there was no reason to. If they
find a plugin that needs it they turn on the switch, so I think that is a
bit chicken and egg. But you are right the plugin will
have a smaller audience. Then again by the time it is out of beta we are on
php 7.5 :)

Brother, most of them are only now switching away from PHP 4.
Seriously, on most hosting systems I've used, PHP 4 is the default.
There's usually a switch to enable PHP 5, but that's the best you can
find.

At this rate, you'll start seeing PHP 6 support on hosts in about 2023.

well... < PHP 5.2 or < 5.3 and WordPress Support EOL is I think a duplicate
of :
http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/suggest-topics-for-the-july-15-2010-dev/

Now we are 0.5 year later and I see support with most big shared hosting
ones: mediatemple, dreamhost, A1, lunarpages, host gator, etc... etc..

So I think the decision to go from EOL for anything earlier than 5.2 to the
same discussion EOL for anything earlier than 5.3 will be earlier than 2032
:)

I am looking to sell a couple of premium plugins and so I did some research
into some existing premium plugins.  I noticed that one plugin in particular
has the code licensed as GPL but the css and images seperatley licensed to
restrict redistribution.  What are you thoughts on this method?

-- 

Looking for users to test and provide feedback on new premium plugin here
soon.  Will bribe anyone who helps with a generous discount on the final
product.  Email me off-list if interested.

This is something I would really like to answer in detail, buy driving at the moment.

Short answer: 

Plugins should be released under a full GPL vs2+

It's common WP practice that the code that extends WordPress which is
licensed under GPL is in fact also under GPL.

However the css, images, photos, graphics that are created by the developer
can remain under a restricted license.

A great practice for making money off of plugins is to sell support, and and
accept donations. It builds a ton of reputation and you can also sell custom
dev services to expand on the Plugin for specific client needs.

Hi there,

We buy a range of premium plugins and themes, often to support the author.  However the one thing that will make us not use / buy is this gpl/restricted license style.  Offer it for sale, but supply it as completely gpl cf gravity forms or shopp or even release free cf wp-ecommerce.

From the POV of earning from it have a hosted demo and offer the product for sale.

Ref your signature what does the plugin do?


BTW Plugins that require ion cube or similar to run are always off the shopping list.

Interesting.  Because I was looking at gravity forms and while the php code
is gpl, their images and css arent according to their terms page.  The
plugin is a support ticket system.

Simple enough I want to force no comments on pages with my shortcode, now I
can use the comments_open filter, but most themes are setup to display some
message like comments closed if no comments are opened, ideally I want to
supress that too.  My thinking is maybe I could use css to hide that
message, for example in twentyten I know that's wrapped with the class
"nocomments" is this usually the case?

I have a site that is about to break 1 Million comments.

Are there any solutions for breaking up the comments into multiple comments tables so I do not have one giant table will a million rows.  Or archiving old comments, without having to delete them.

anyone dealt with a site with this many comments and have any advice.

thanks,

Andrew

	Name
Message-ID: <AANLkTinUOZ6t3Wve9v1XrtQn2jz=dv+FYtFPOp5miCuO@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening,

I am looking for the name of the DB option related to the Custom Image
Header feature, that corresponds to the "Header Text: Display Text" setting
field on the Appearance -> Header Admin Screen. This field has an ID of
"hidetext", but I can't find any option with this name.

I am trying to figure out how to code my Theme header, such that it respects
this setting and only displays the Header Text inside the image if the user
has the "Display Text" option set to "Yes".

Thanks in advance!

Chip

1. Check content-type, if exists. If it is "text/html" then run the filter
to get the favicon.ico.

2. Oh my god, who would have thought an use case like this would have come
up?

3. You need to look for "Refresh" header as well. Some web servers (IIS)
will send Refresh instead of Location as well as web sites with a redirect
message for systems that do not support redirects.

To be honest asking a bunch of developers about licensing isn't a smart
idea, while at the mention of licenses we all appear to become lawyers this
isn't the case. I personally disagree with WordPress.org statement that any
plugin is a derived from WordPress therefore falls under the GPL license
others agree whole heartly. If you're looking to sell Premium plugins and
are wondering what your options are licensing wise ask a copyright lawyer or
just look at previous discussions.

We talked about this in the latest episode of explicitweb (season 2 ep 4
"Open web technologies) http://explicitweb.co.uk/

<http://explicitweb.co.uk/>I don't mean to deliberately plug, but there is a
recorded lengthly discussion of licensing and dual licensing which includes
John O'Nolan who is a core contributor to WordPress.

In summary, the people who make WordPress want you to use the GPL and state
that all your work with WordPress is a derivative. It is also true that your
own graphics/images/css, provided they are not copied from anywhere within
WordPress arguably are not derivative and can be licensed separately.

John's solution is to use the GPL and add an extra clause for his CSS/images
only which states that whilst you may redistribute etc as per the GPL you
may not redistribute carbon copy. So you can make his stuff better (or
worse) but you can't just rip him off.

Seemed like a good solution to me.

Hannah

P.S. In the above by "GPL" I mean GPL vs2+

As far as I know selling plugins and the gpl are not incompatible. You can still have a plugin or theme that is licensed under gpl and sell it. The worry of course is that people will simply buy it from you and sell it again. Which they are allowed to do under gpl. 

I agree with the ethos of the gpl but it does make it hard to make a living from it.

Surely there is an elegant solution to this - is there not, say,
libraries for PHP to cleanup HTML output?

Hi guys,

Thanks very much for this, these look great. But I wasn't really
looking for a plugin solution to the problem but roughly how one would
go about coding these kind of relationships where one has post type B
(releases) being organised under post type A (artists) within a single
plugin (or even in a functions .php file). So how to make one post
type owned by another simply - linking two together in a way that is
equivalent to a "artists has_many releases" in SQLish psuedo-code.

Thanks again.

All the very best,

Alex

I appreciate that reply, but it doesn't really help answer my question. I've
checked core source files, and can't find this particular option defined or
used.

I suppose I should go have a look in my own SQL...

This information is stored among other theme mods values in the
options table, with the option name of "theme_mods_[theme slug]."

In other words, it's retrieved by get_theme_mod( 'header_textcolor' )
and set by set_theme_mod( 'header_textcolor', [ new value ] ).

The default can be set with the HEADER_TEXTCOLOR constant and the
value modified by attaching a callback to the
"theme_mod_header_textcolor" filter.

To clarify, the "Display Text" value is based on whether the header
textcolor value is "blank" or empty (in which case it's "No"; "Yes"
otherwise).

Did you flush your rewrite rules after changing that?

I have posts showing up under /news  (using custom structure 
/news/%postname%/)

I created an Events post type and set the slug to 'events' and it works 
fine. It shows up as /events/post-slug

Maybe you're missing something when setting up your post type. Here's a 
paste of what I used:

Hope this helps

When trying to install the Debug bar console without debug bar installed,
the plugin installs and doesnt even add a notification (Not showed for me
atleast)
Thats ok when you are using it for developers only coz thats something we
can understand and do. but for regular users you need to have a very good
way of showing dependency right?

Use the activation hook to check for the other plugin and then hook into
admin notices to display a nag with a link to install the missing plugin.
Alternatively, you can always check for the other plugin and display a nag
if is_admin() and die gracefully if not is_admin().

Okay, that cleared things up for me. I think I'm seeing my problem now.

Might perhaps the "Display Text" description be a bit of a misnomer there?
If "Yes" is checked, changing the value to "No" won't actually change
anything, will it?

Or, should I just be using if ( get_header_textcolor() ) as the conditional
to determine whether or not to display header text?

Thanks,

Chip

Have you already considered just using the post_parent property in the 
child posts to point at the parent? You could just use get_children() to 
find the releases of an artist.

Pretty much the only way you will ever guarantee "pretty" HTML output is 
to buffer the whole page output and run it through something like 
htmltidy before sending it to the browser.

Most people are not going to consider this worth the effort. You'd be 
trading off a whole lot of server resources and page generation time for 
a result that practically nobody is ever going to see. I'm not saying 
that there might not be a plugin already that does this, I haven't 
looked. But it's not something *I* would use, because my server's CPU 
has better things to do with its time, like serving pages as fast as 
possible.

If I want pretty HTML, I'll save the source to a file, and run tidy on that.

Hmm, that's not working either.

It seems that I cannot find any way to respect a user selection of "No" for
"Display Text" on Dashboard -> Appearance -> Header.

Is this something that I'm just not doing right, is it a known issue, or is
it something for which I should submit a Trac report?

Yes.

Plugins that want to offer extension points do so in the same way as core - actions / filters

Plugins that extend and require other plugins make sure users know when they are running in degraded mode.

For extra bonus points these plugins make it real easy to install the required plugins for there full functionality.

The legalities are quite clear with reguards to css and images, its not
really posssible to claim they are a derivitive work, unlike the code which
is more of a gray area.  Reguardless my intrest is in how the wordpress
community feels about the practice of licensing css and images seperatly.

I'm working on a support ticket plugin and I'm looking for users to test and
provide feedback on it.  Will bribe anyone who helps with a generous
discount on the final product.  Email me off-list if interested.

Why not make a double license for WordPress too? People who want to
contribute to open source and give out free plugins can extend WordPress and
make their plugins just as they do now.
People who want to earn can also do that by may be paying a fixed amount /
paying a part of their income to WP. WP can have some encryption technique
added to its core. something like ioncube, just not that slow.

That would be a rather blatant GPL violation. WordPress is a derivative of
B2, which was licensed under GPL. Therefore, WPF cannot legally license
WordPress under anything other than GPL, nor can it distribute obfuscated
code without also releasing the cleartext source.

Additionally, there is no copyright assignment, so you would require
every single person who has contributed to WordPress to agree to
relicense it. And that's not going to happen. :)

I didn't know WP was a derivative. I am no lawyer and can't comment on
anything legal here. :(

Why would all contributors not agree?

If they don't agree for double license.
All I can say is, all the contributors are missing out on making WordPress a
far superior blogging s/w / CMS.
The money can be used in making GSoC type internship oppurtunities, you can
hold free online tutorials.
People can be hired to complete the documentation and also to write
alternate WP cores for considering other possibilities and benchmarks.
WP can fund development of some plugins etc like BuddyPress...
We can have LTS versions with a closed paid group focusing on that. Core
plugins can be made possible etc etc etc...
Who would say no to that?

Though no point dreaming now :(

I doubt its even feasible to find and contact each contributor as there have
been so many over time.  But that really gets away from the point of this
discussion.

I'm working on a support ticket plugin and I'm looking for users to test and
provide feedback on it.  Will bribe anyone who helps with a generous
discount on the final product.  Email me off-list if interested.

How much would have to change in the codebase to make WP no longer a derivative? Surely once it changes enough the gpl becomes void? 

I am not sure having two stems of wordpress is the best solution but it would allow developers to profit from their work directly. I for one would be up for discussing and contributing to a second version of WP.

Yeah, and you have to repeat that code in each dependant plugin.

For static dependency checking (without having any of the involved plugins
activated), check out my meta plugin:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/plugin-dependencies/

It's very basic now, but an enhanced version is on the way.

Here is a list of suggestions that presumably have a higher priority:

I was considering two of them: Full-Throttle Trac Annihilation (I think that

There was a student that tackled this last year, but it doesn't matter,
since trac is always full of bugs that need fixing. ;)

Not decided yet.

scribu, I saw your plugin but how would it work if the plugin-dependencies
plugin weren't installed already? We'll have to either ship your plugin as a
part of each of the base and dependent plugins and use it from there or make
the user install the plugin-dependencies plugin before he can activate any
of the dependent plugin.
the best possible solution would be to add the "Dependency:" field to
WordPress itself (core I mean)

Indeed, it would be a lot easier if dependencies were backed into Core.

It would be even awesomer if it the depedencies could be automatically
downloaded from wp.org.

It's worth noting that some of the projects on the Codex have been attempted
the last year. The code (or at least part of it) has been written, but
didn't make it into Core.

I think prospective participants would do well to check them out, both for
inspiration but also to avoid doing the same mistakes:

* New user walkthrough (Setup
Meter<http://gsoc2010.wordpress.com/mike-whitfield-setup-meter/>
)
* Template versioning (Theme

* Automatic Migration<http://gsoc2010.wordpress.com/brian-mckenna-automatic-migration/>
* Comment moderation
(Comments<http://gsoc2010.wordpress.com/matt-harzewski-comments/>
)

I've contributed to WordPress, and I definitely wouldn't agree to it, so
the developers would have to rewrite my code. Multiply that by all the
developers that wouldn't agree to this (which is most of them), and
you're essentially writing a new piece of software.

You're missing the point of open source. Open source is more than just
having the source code available to take. It's the ability to take that
code, improve upon it and then contribute back to the community. I can
take WordPress and rename it "Ryan's Awesome Blogging Software v4.2.6"
if I want, and the GPL license affords me this ability.

There's no reason people can't write documentation/plugins already. We
(contributors) don't do it for the money, we do it as volunteer work. I
profit from services I offer based on WordPress, so it's only fair to
contribute back to the software. If you then go and close the source
code, it means I can't contribute to the code, and if the source were
closed, I wouldn't want to either.

However, I'm sure someone much more eloquent than I can pipe up and give
a better rationale about this.

The GPL is all about giving rights to the USERS of your software, it is not
about protecting rights of the developer (that's what copyright is for).
You give them a number of freedoms, not restrictions, the only restrictions
they have are that they cannot take away from others  those
freedoms that they themselves were afforded, .
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

And despite what some people say, the GNU GPL *is* the embodiment of a
philosophy.

None of this restricts you from making money from the software or
it's derivatives. http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html


If you don't want to work within this philosophy, you should look to a
software project that allows you to place restrictions on users of your
software.

I think some of you are seriously working with the wrong bit of software.

It's already been said, by working with WP you're subscribing to a
philosophy, if you don't like that philosophy then the solution is work with
something else, not try to change WP & the people who work on/with it.

It's really not about the money. If you like money, write your own
publishing platform/CMS and sell it.

I don't think you got the whole idea as I was trying to put it. The source
code remains open source and ready to contribute for people who already do
that and it will always be. Why would WordPress close its source anyway?
Its about those people who write plugins and go all heights to make it paid
only. They will have to pay WordPress community back in cash.

A lot of us pay back to the community in one way or the other.
But there are those who extend WordPress and sell their plugins.
Check this out:-
http://www.gravityforms.com/terms-and-conditions/
try getting the latest version of gforms and this one
http://www.gravityhelp.com/forums/topic/is-it-gpl (yes its true, css files
aren't covered).
My point is as WordPress users get helpless in such situations. we should
keep dual license to take care of that or take some action
(copyright infringement / demand giving php files out for free)

Try understanding the meaning of a dual license please.
Well one good example to help you with this is the PHP license. ( Its not
compatible with GPL and still works for them!! )
Its one thing to support a side and another to refuse to see a better
option. I'll say this one last time before I give up.
With dual license "OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTORS AND USERS/ DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE
FREE ACCESS AND COMPLETE AUTONOMY!!!!!!!!!" having said that, the exact
clauses can be discussed, debated and chalked out.

And for a reply to what seems to me like a pointless flame war.
"Please get all source codes ( php ) you can from all the developers selling
plugins to people who DO NOT understand  GPL terms and push them to the
plugin repository with some css n images of your own"

The above is a slow and continuous fix to the problem and I honestly don't
think any slow and continuous fix can be implemented properly.
I would be more than glad if such a group turns up and gets down to keep the
spirit of open source alive.

The only reason for dual licensing would be to place restrictions on some
users. Regardless of the reasons for it, it goes against the philosophy of
the GPL.

Those people who charge for their GPL plugins are free to contribute code
and money (via the foundation) back to WordPress. But *requiring* them to
contribute money so that they can restrict users is not only against the
philosophy it is, in my opinion, morally corrupt.

Users are not helpless, they can choose to use a different plugin or can
even ask someone who has paid for it to give them a copy for free (albeit
without css or graphics).

Personally, I have spent thousands of dollars on paid for plugins and
themes, but I would not spend a penny on a dual licensed one.

I think the bottom line here is that if you want to make money from wordpress do not ask about it on this list. There is a certain philosophy behind WP and it is shared by most if not all contributors. And they do it free. I respect that. I however do not have the finances or time to volunteer my time right now. In the future I would like to. I appreciate and am grateful for all the work that has been put in to WP to make it such a great platform. Telling people to simply use another system or build their own is not helpful. Developers can build whatever they like on WordPress and sell it for however much they want. It just has to inherit the license. There's no way round that. Even if there was, this is not the place to discuss it. The WP community will in all likelihood not approve or support you but that may not be important to some. 

All too often discussions on this topic end in fall outs and harsh words. It's a shame but understandable. 

Perhaps a list should be started for those who want to pursue the route of profiting from wordpress and for whom approval of the WP community is not a priority? 

It's a really tough one. I don't have the answers but I'm pretty sure they answers won't be found on this list. 

With respect. 

Andy.

I make money from WordPress, as do many others, including Automattic.
The key is to sell services, rather than products. I sell plugin
development services. Others do the same, and others sell support
services. Additionally, some sell plugins/themes (take a look at
WooThemes for example).

It's certainly possible to sell products, but it's somewhat harder. My
personal theory is that you need to make it enticing enough that people
will want to buy your plugin instead of merely grabbing a free plugin.
I'll admit, this is harder than it should be. Merely to offer the same
level of support in WordPress itself is harder than it should be (i.e.
automatic updates, etc.), IMHO.

There is absolutely nothing whatsoever wrong with what the GravityForms
folks are doing.

Nope there is. as plugins donot interact only as a fork process to
WordPress, GPL sees it as a part of the software and thus, they are legally
bound to release their source code in public making it equally easy to
obtain as they have made the paid version (stripped off of the css n images)

They are required to distribute the code to those they supply and they are required to not restrict their freedoms.  If however it was a hosted service they won't need to supply the source code as it would be a service being supplied.

There is no requirement for them to distribute the code for free nor to make it easy for someone to obtain it for free.  However if I so choice they can not stop me giving away or charging for the GPL code.  That is the freedom the GPL gives me.    However I must also supply the source code and not restrict the freedoms of those I supply.

Thanks a lot.  One more thing - should I stick to one proposal or can I 
submit two proposals for two WP tasks and let the admins choose the 
better one?

Im regretting opening this can of worms...if only I knew.

FWIW I have done some thinking about this on my own and have decided
that to restrict the css and images like that is kinda I underhanded
imo and im not going to do that.  Now someone could do what was
described in that gravity forms forums post someone linked to but the
way I figure it it probably still happens to gravity forms because
people aren't aware of the separate license or they just don't care.

Example: Akismet. The plugin is open-source but the actual spam detection is done on Akismet servers, therefore it is a service and not required to be open source. (Also, it's not a derivative of WP that way). If you want to make money, you can build a plugin that connects to your api and then charge for access to the api. I'm building a plugin right now that does exactly that, although it also includes a library so you can fully self-host if you wish (and I think that is the absolute right way to do it). WP is supposed to be bigger than any one person ? you can branch trunk or any plugin or theme to make necessary changes or make it better. I've done it with other peoples' plugins and I hope people do it with mine. Without that sort of culture WP will quickly fall behind and will see the lack of innovation most proprietary CMSes are known for.

They are required to distribute the code to those they supply and they are required to not restrict their freedoms.  If however it was a hosted service they won't need to supply the source code as it would be a service being supplied.

There is no requirement for them to distribute the code for free nor to make it easy for someone to obtain it for free.  However if I so choice they can not stop me giving away or charging for the GPL code.  That is the freedom the GPL gives me.    However I must also supply the source code and not restrict the freedoms of those I supply.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSOC 2011 Proposal
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=+OBEYj7hCnJec7Nj27poOvB4K2QCXsEUnkjD1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
This is what I propose to do in GSoC 2011: A plugin to build and manage
University websites.
University websites are now powered by CMS?s. Building and maintaining a
full fledged University
website is a pain. I am saying this with some experience in doing so. A
WordPress plugin for creating a university site will make WordPress the best
choice for such websites.
The plugin would provide the following features :
- Pages for various departments(also student organizations, research groups
et al)
- Easy way for adding Staff
- Staff pages added as child to pages
- Providing news separately for each department
- Easy result publications
- Permission and workflows
-Events calender

Does any one think this is a good proposal for the project?

Thank you.

You need to re-read the actual text of the GPL. You grossly misunderstand
the license requirements.

Those who distribute under GPL are under no requirement whatsoever to
release their code "to the public", or "for free". Rather, they are required
to provide, to those to whom they distribute their work, the cleartext
source for that work.

They are under no obligation to distribute their work to any arbitrary
person (i.e. the "public"); they are allowed - explicitly under the terms of
the GPL - to distribute their code only to those who purchase that code. And
if they sell their code, they are only obligated to provide the source code
to those who purchase their code.

Please see the past three years (if not longer) of WP-Hackers archives, for
the ad nauseum repetition of this argument.

I don't.

Its a great idea, but University's usually have their own IT department which usually under their remit have the website.
And most universities provide website space to their departments since many different departments require a different setup to others.

For example the web/computing department would want LAMP's and generally everything else ends up on IIS powered gear.

I speak from knowing bits and pieces about how the University of Leeds website infrastructure is setup.

WordPress doesn't have the power and flexibility or security needed to manage a whole university.

Something for a specific department that doesn't want to use the university provided space or cms yes tho.

Gaurav its a good idea, specially in India but may be not one for GSoC. on
the other hand the same idea under a different name and may be some more
thinking will give you a good proposal idea
In this case,
Think more on the lines of adding few capabilities to WordPress such that it
can be used, as is, like a complete CMS. {obviously then you can use it for
a univ website too, with may be a plugin or two}
WordPress can be used as a complete CMS but its not something its configured
for by default (Don't torch me for writing this, please!)

As someone who is "the web department" for a small/medium sized university at http://www.nicholls.edu, I can attest that WordPress currently works decently well as a collaborative CMS. All content management solutions for any type of website are going to have different needs, so a "one size fits all" approach to deployment is unnecessary.

Things that might be useful for a university based website are; Plugins to bridge some of the gaps to learning apps like Moodle or Blackboard, Plugins to strengthen profiles with/like BuddyPress to help university communities communicate, catalog and course management information and stuff that can hook into ugly higher ed management systems like SCT Banner, and training tools for WordPress always help. Heck, GSoC projects that just help to continue the development of tools like WordPress that help guys like me do my job with no budget and no staff helps tremendously.

Peace!
Jess

Subject: [wp-hackers] Allow Site Admins to Edit Users
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=nnc2K9RkhXDEthzK9F2MzizQUnDetkaghBM9s@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've got a fairly restricted multi site install and we need to give site
admins the ability to edit users.

I realze that out of the box multi-site only allows super admins (for
security reasons + users may be members of multiple sites) but in this
scenario users are nearly always part of a distinct site.

So..has anyone had any success allowing admins to edit users and if so can
they share how? I understand it will most likely be a core modification.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Jason

The capability 'manage_network_users' (
http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#manage_network_users)
gives access to the Network Users page; so if you want a user to be able to
access that you could grant them that capability?

Thanks for the reply Alex.

I've tried adding that capability to site admins. It gives them access to
the Network Users page but they still can't edit them. Gives error "You do
not have permission...etc..."

Ideally I'd like site admins to be able to just edit them via the standard
users list pages.

May be something on top of BuddyPress and ScholarPress will do the trick.

Im regretting opening this can of worms...if only I knew.

FWIW I have done some thinking about this on my own and have decided
that to restrict the css and images like that is kinda I underhanded
imo and im not going to do that.  Now someone could do what was
described in that gravity forms forums post someone linked to but the
way I figure it it probably still happens to gravity forms because
people aren't aware of the separate license or they just don't care.

What Chip said is true. Check the link below for detailed information
regarding the GPL. Selling a GPL software requires only that 1. You provide
the source code to the buyers (if they want it) and 2. You can't stop them
(the buyers) from redistributing the software at will.

I'm surprised of how many "quote" the GPL but never seem to have checked
with the source...

Sidenote: "Root page" is a MUCH better label than "front page" which is not
very clear, especially in relation to "home" which is semantically
equivalent to "front page" but in this case indicates an important
difference.

How many puppies would need to be sacrificed to get these two confusing
functions to be deprecated in favor of is_root() and is_blog(). is_blog()
would tell you if you are on the 'posts archive', whether it is on the root
or in a 'page'.

As for the question about is_front_page() I think it's worth dealing with
extra hassle for the consistency in this case.

I really don't think anyone should use query_posts() for any reason ever, so
the fact that the change would help that use-case makes me even less
friendly to it. query_posts is ALWAYS the wrong way to do something. If what
you want is a secondary query to add to the main content (more headlines,
related etc.) you should use new WP_Query() to avoid overwriting the main
query. If what you want is to modify the main query then query_posts is
terrible because it lets the main query still run, then just throws away the
original results in favor of the new ones. This means a very wasteful posts
query (in my case doing it that way was really hurting database performance
till i fixed it).

By comparison you are way better off modifying the query using filters on
the original main query, inserting whatever values it is you want. This
keeps the single posts query and also helps you preserve any other query
values that you don't predict, like paging and homepage status. Filtering
the main query is pretty tricky but IMHO it is the right way to do it, and
if you do it that way you don't have to worry about is_front_page getting
mangled.

So far the biggest issue I had with this was being able to identify only the
main query. I think there is a new function for it in 3.0/3.1 that I
couldn't use, so it's probably easier now. My solution was to attach an
action to 'pre_get_posts' which runs before every query, but remove the
action inside itself, so that it only ran once, on the very first query
which was also the main query.

Yes! Would also be nice if we could even bypass the default query if we need to.  I requested as much on trac a few years ago but with no takers.

Denis de Bernardy recommended $wp_query===$wp_the_query to me, which seems to work well.

Personally, I don't concern myself with clean output, and prefer it be 
as small and tight as possible for reduced payload size.

Every major browser now comes with tools (or have them available) that 
show you a live collapsible view of the HTML - very rarely do I ever 
need to look and see what the raw html looks like since I spend my time 
looking at these tools - even then though, you can get the HTML of a 
selection pretty easily, which reduces the amount of HTML you need to 
sift through enough that it can be pretty messy, and you'll do fine.

The thought of going back 5 years to a time when firebug didn't exist, 
is enough to give me nightmares.

You should aim for to minimise the size of files being downloaded.
Think of all the extra bytes you'll save not having to faff around
adding spaces and tabs in to your source.

Keep your code readable on the server, but keep it fast on the client.

A more ideal solution would be to write a plugin to do Dougal said, but pair
that with a caching plugin, so the markup output only needs to be tidied up
once.

But you'd need to check out the WP-Super-Cache plugin to make sure your tidy
script runs before the cache is generated. It might be worth checking out
other caching plugins too.

But, the downside to this is that all those linebreaks and tabs do add up to
a larger filesize when users access your site. You could potentially be
adding 10-20% download times by doing it your way. I'd run Google Page Speed
or YSlow to see what, if any, negative effects having tidy HTML actually
adds, and weight it against the positive effects.

If your server is sending gzip'd or deflated data to begin with (as it
should be), then this effect is minimized. That increase should be
under 1% or so.

Agree with this, however note that some of these tools don't take
server compression into account, and can provide a misleading
viewpoint sometimes.

Also, if you want to do this sort of thing, you should really just do
it at the server level. Install Google's mod_pagespeed and watch it
solve most of your problems automagically.

Interesting discussion.

But for now quickly: has anyone tried to run mod_pagespeed alongside
W3 Cache? I heard they didn't play nice with each other.

All the best,

I think mod_pagespeed has issues with the minify scripts.  I use it with
wp_super_cache and don't notice any issues there.

I'm not. As a landlord I hear a person or two (even lawyers) quote non-
existent Texas Property codes at least once per month. I only know them
so well because I skim them each time I evict someone. The eviction
Judge in my jurisdiction has misquoted them.

Even people who do read long contracts often unintentionally read into
them things which are simply not there.

I have had several tenants refer me to the lease clause which says it is
okay to play loud music during the day. I don't have any clauses about
playing music in the lease. The word "music" is not in even there.

I have found myself quoting passages or ideas from books only to later
find them mysteriously missing. :)

Face it. Human beings suck at this activity.

Exactly, otherwise i bet most people would not use WordPress, because if a
company develops a plugin for their own internal use well now anyone could
just demand the source from them, same with any plugin or theme any
developer here designs for their client.  Of course there would be the
possibility of claiming its not derivative so you chose a proprietary
license but that's a whole other issue we won't go into.

Point is that's not how GPL worked, and if it was the would cause a huge set
of problems.

After the last email from me on this thread. I exchanged a few mails with
people at gravity forms.
Carl gave this link to me http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html and I
was amazed but at least corrected. I did read the GPL before posting here
but misunderstood it.
Its not legally binding on anyone to release the source code and as in
Gravity Forms case, they believe that if they hadn't sold the plugin and
gave it away for free, the plugin would have ceased to exist.
I am sorry for the fuss I created because of my misunderstanding.
All the folks who came up to explain and have been patient with all this,
thanks a lot!

Things I learnt as a summary to whoever searches the archive
There are two ways to making a licensed plugin.

   1. SaaS and
   2. Registering its css and images / icons under a separate license.

People can decide not to give away the source code of their plugins for
free(price) themselves even if they are selling it.
But someone buying from them can put its php code with new css for free.
WordPress is not going to be dual licensed ever

One doubt that I still have is can people sell encrypted plugins? While
selling the plugin code.
Do they need to give the full source code(php) or is that too a matter of
personal decision of the plugin author?
Say someone encrypted a part or whole of their plugin with ioncube and added
a check to their server for some key before the plugin can be
decrypted/decoded and run?

If the Plugin is released under GPL, then yes, they must release the source
(by request, to those to whom they have distributed the code) for the
encrypted bits. Otherwise, the code isn't really GPL, because downstream
users do not have the full rights granted by the license.

That sounds like a fair solution, but this would be roughly the same
as having one custom post type - ie artists - what i want is two -
artists and releases.

Thanks a lot

Hi

It depends on php, change this on php.ini:

post_max_size = 20M
upload_max_filesize = 20M

Subject: [wp-hackers] Enhanced emails GSoC task
Message-ID: <AANLkTikUgQacEZnoF9CFmwfODZ=0aQ=JwHz7ohoh4LwC@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My name is Dawid Warcha? and I'm studying Electronics and Communications on
the
elite AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. For the last few
years I have
been involved in university projects, and polished my programming skills in
a few
languages, PHP mostly.

I would like to work on the "enhanced e-mails" GSoC task. Are there any
suggestions
concerning this particular project that should be taken into account? I love
the idea of designing
HTML e-mail templates and adjusting them to work on various devices such as
IPads, Ipods,
Blackberry etc.

*cheers,*

It will also depend on the configuration of the sending and receiving MTA's as they may also limit email size

It's the same with the Bible, the US Constitution (which is pretty 
short) and just about any other popular text.

You just have to face it, either you follow Matt's philosophy and let other
people copy and even resell your stuff or the WordPress/Automattic inner
circle will completely shun you from the community. It doesn't matter if
your code is 100% your own work and distributed separately from WordPress,
if it touches WordPress in any way Matt says it is a derivative work. You
can use all the logic, facts, and legal precedents you want but it won't
make any difference to them, it's either GPL or you're out.

None of the core bloggers will let you advertise on their sites, they will
refuse to let you sponsor Word Camps, and you will basically be treated as a
bastard in the community. If you try to converse with important people in
the community and they find out you sell non-GPL software, the conversation
abruptly ends.

Also, you cannot advertise your plugin on wordpress.org and of course cannot
use any of the distribution or update methods built into wordpress so your
customers are forced to manually update your software.

So yeah go ahead and argue.

>>It's the same with the Bible, the US Constitution...<<

This could SO go into some tangent that would be both incredibly offensive and hilarious. Being from a redneck state, I could go *all kinds of ways* with this.

But I won't. Because I'm a good girl.

Not entirely true. If you touch the WP API via XML-RPC, there's not a
single problem any of us would have with your program. See, e.g.,
MarsEdit.

There are two competing priorities: the legal concerns, and the ethical
concerns. Here's how I've made my peace with the conflict between the two:

I don't think anyone would question my stance on the matter of WordPress
Themes/Plugins being inherently derivative works of WordPress. I've been as
outspoken as anyone on that matter.

However, I accept that the WordPress community has rightfully defined its
own ethos with respect to acceptable licensing of WordPress Plugins and
Themes. I can stand on legal principle and disagree with that ethos - and as
a result, become outcast from the WordPress community; or, I can choose
willingly to give up some of my own freedom and legal rights (of licensing
choice for works for which I own the copyright), in order to conform to the
ethos of the WordPress community.

For me, the choice is easy: I want to be a part of the community, and I want
to give back (what little I am able), in a "pay it forward" sense that makes
licensing my WordPress-related code under GPL. So, I choose to do so.

(Admittedly, this stance on principle is not much of a sacrifice for me. The
food I put on my family's table doesn't in any way depend on anything I
contribute to the WordPress community.)

Others may choose differently, for differing reasons. But I've made my
choice - even as I remain outspoken regarding the lack of copyright case law
precedent for claiming that copyright law considers *dependent* code, absent
any actual incorporation of copyrightable code, to be *derivative* code.

To be sure: what you *believe* matters. But what matters much more are the
*choices* you make, based on what you believe.

Unfortunately, some of us completely depend on our software to put food on
the table and pay the mortgage and it really sucks when someone in Indonesia
starts selling your software for $5 and it is completely legal for them to
do that if it is GPL. I write software for Windows and Microsoft doesn't own
me, why should writing software for WordPress be any different? The stuff I
sell is 100% my own code and I do not derive from WordPress any more than
WordPress derives from Apache. A plugin is not a derivative work and most
legal experts (other than the FSF) agree, but again facts don't make a
difference to the inner circle, either you obey them or you are shunned.

And who says you can't contribute to the community in other ways? I do
provide free plugins and have contributed a number of bug reports. Also, by
creating software that people use, even if it is proprietary, you are still
contributing to the value of the community and to WordPress as a platform.

Personally, I agree with you - and in the long-run, I think that forcing the
GPL-inheritance matter in the way it has been thus far pursued will be
damaging to both the community and to the project.

But there's not really anything I can do about that. So, I try to pick my
battles, and try to operate within the WordPress meritocracy by finding ways
to contribute. (And when need be, I head over to the WPTavern forum and
vent. :) )

I don't envy the situation you're in. There are times when I've thought
about trying to build a WordPress-centric business, but at other times, it
seems that the wise choice is to wait and to see where the dust settles
regarding viable third-party WordPress business models.

You are making the same mistake that many software authors make: you
assume that the GPL is there to protect you, the author; this is, in
fact, false. The GPL is about protecting _user_ freedoms.

All of those things are good -- great, even. I agree that the
WordPress community can drift into core-?ber-alles territory and
devalue other methods of contributing, a set of circumstances that has
existed since the pre-1.2 days, to be honest.

[...]However, I accept that the WordPress community has rightfully defined its
own ethos with respect to acceptable licensing of WordPress Plugins and
Themes.[...]

That hits the nail on the head. Without any actual court cases happening no one really knows the legality of derivative works. The whole thesis debacle went a step closer to defining it but I think all it really proved was the power and influence Matt has. 

I'm all for good ethics and morals but unfortunately it is a fact that they are not always conducive to making a living. 

For what it's worth my solution was to build a hosted service. No one downloads or even sees my code so there's no worries about people stealing it and reselling. Whilst this solution works for me I understand that it doesn't solve the larger issue if licensing and derivative works. 

I think this will keep producing massive threads until either something changes within automatic or a case goes to court......

This is entirely within their rights.  If you're advocating that someone
should force WordPress bloggers to allow you to advertise on their site
merely because you develop with WordPress I think you'd meet with a *lot* of
resistance.  Individual blog authors, core team or otherwise, will
*always* have
the prerogative to decide whom can and cannot advertise on their sites.

Once again, within their rights.  You can always choose who you talk to, but
most of the "important people in the community" are mature enough that, if
the conversation is worth having, they'll still talk to you even though you
sell non-GPL software.

WordPress.org is run by the WordPress Foundation and has always stated they
will only allow the distribution of GPL-compatible plug-ins through their
system.   This is a decision that was made long ago to protect the user, and
it's not likely to change (nor would many of us want it to).  However, the
statement that you can't use built-in update methods is just ... wrong.

Brad Williams, Ozh Richards, and Justin Tadlock just published Professional
WordPress Plugin Development (you can get it on Amazon:
http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222).
 It's a great book that covers licensing in detail, and even includes a
section explaining how you can make your plug-ins update from a
privately-hosted repository using the built-in updater.

Ronald Huereca published a detailed tutorial just last week explaining how
commercial or client plug-ins can build-in automatic updates:
http://www.wpajax.com/articles/wordpress-upgrade-class-for-commercial-or-client-plugins

So no, you can't advertise a commercial, non-GPL plug-in on the website of a
GPL-sponsoring foundation with a long history of prohibiting that tactic.
 But you *can* use the built-in update methods that are built into WordPress
to update your privately-hosted plug-ins.


> So yeah go ahead and argue.
>

How is this kind of challenge beneficial to the community or your argument?
 If you want anyone to support your position, try to take a less abrasive
tone when sending out a mass message.  Particularly when many of us are in a
similar boat (I also publish both free and paid solutions) and might be able
to back up your argument.

The trick with selling GPL software is making sure you stay ahead of the
curve.  Offer automatic updates *only* to paid customers.  Offer support
through a forum *only* to paid customers.  Give your customers a legitimate
reason to come to you, rather than the peddler of the $5 knockoff.  The
point of the GPL is to give the end-user (your customer) the right and
ability to make modifications to your code.  If your plug-in
only satisfies 99% of their need, the GPL gives them permission to take it
the other 1% of the way to fixing their specific problem.  It also protects
the community should you, for any reason, decide to abandon the system.
 Then, one of your customers can take up the mantle and keep things going.

And who says you can't contribute to the community in other ways? I do

No one's saying that.  The argument started as a question of creating a
non-GPL plugin.  Then it evolved into a debate over whether or not
WordPress-related work could venture away from the GPL at all.  Now it seems
to be a straight ad homiem attack on the core WordPress team, which is
completely groundless and does more harm to the community than good.  Yes,
you can contribute to the community at large in other ways, but which part
of the community are you contributing to?  Does distributing a closed-source
system help the core WordPress platform grow?  Does it help add features?
 Or does it just drag our discussions and interactions into back-and-forth
debates with increasing overtones of negativity and angst?

At the end of the day, it all boils down to what you are trying to
accomplish.  WordPress.org, as a site, exists to promote the open source
WordPress platform and open source extensions to that platform.  If you want
to sell a closed-source or other non-GPL system, that's not the place to do
it.  If you want to argue otherwise, entering a debate with the core team is
not going to be productive.  They're working hard to further the development
of the open source system and will likely ignore the discussion ("the
conversation abruptly ends") to move on to things that more directly affect
the project itself or its users - the millions of bloggers building their
sites on WordPress.

There have actually been many, many court cases regarding derivative works.

A derivative work is a work that partially contains someone else's work. My
code is 100% my own and because I don't distribute WordPress with my product
I am not bound by the GPL. My product is combined with WordPress by the end
user, which the end user is allowed to do; the GPL doesn't even come into
play.

For something to be a derivative work it must be a work in the first place;
a work that is separate from the original work. A work is a fixed medium you
can distribute to others, a user installing a plugin that mixes in RAM with
WordPress is simply not a work. I can sell a case for an iPhone that
completely depends on the shape and size of the phone, but my case is
certainly not a derivative work.

Further the GPL plainly and explicitly states that ?You may make, run and
propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions.? In
other words, if you accept the GPL you are not bound to any conditions as
long as you do not convey (distribute) the work to others. An end user is
clearly allowed to modify WordPress for his or her own use and the fact that
they do it themselves, pay someone to do it, or by purchasing code from
someone else it doesn't make a difference because none of these constitute a
violation of the copyright law or the GPL.

The biggest argument I see is that plugins completely depend on WordPress
and it's inner workings. However, books about WordPress also have this same
requirement and they are not derivative works. Dependency does not define a
derivative work.

There is no debate on the legality of it. The GPL makes it perfectly
clear: derivative works must also be GPL.

Now, the question of whether any particular piece of code is
derivative or not is indeed debatable, but only on the merits of the
particular code in question. You can't debate it in a general sense,
realistically. Many people have stated their opinions, many times, and
because it's just their opinion, there's no way to solve that debate.
People disagree and will continue to do so, because they are
disagreeing about their opinions being right or wrong, not about
anything that is actually decidable.

Nevertheless, the wp-hackers mailing list is not really the right
place to have this discussion. Take it to a forum somewhere, please.

Heh. I practically wrote a book [1] on copyright case law and its
applicability to GPL.

The problem is, the argument has been hashed and re-hashed ad nauseum, on
the hackers mailing list and elsewhere. Arguing it again is not going to
change anyone's mind (especially on this mailing list). That's why I try my
best not to engage in arguing the merits here anymore. Nothing fruitful will
come of it.

(Catch me in a more appropriate venue, on the other hand, and I'll discuss
and debate it to your heart's content.)

I apologize for being abrasive, but I really do feel shunned. Yes everyone
has a right to ignore me because of my product, people don't have to accept
my advertising money, and I am not saying they do. Those are just examples
of how much I am shunned, that they won't even take my money.

Despite this I have done very well with my plugin, I have made over $200,000
since I first wrote it several years ago, although sales are steadily
declining nowadays. But besides the money, I would just like to be a part of
the community. Can you imagine how it felt when I decided to become a major
sponsor of a Word Camp and was told they didn't want my money?

This isn't about legal definitions, I got distracted there, it's about the
fact that you follow Matt or you are out of the community, which is why I
have to use an alias just to participate on this list.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2011
Message-ID: <AANLkTinHzsk6B=eYq8GBmgOjNP82b9mg_njoTsw3G8uk@mail.gmail.com>

*Hey All*

*My GSoC 2011 proposal is as:*


Please do have a look..

*Overview*

The Project aims to build a package of modules to Completely integrate
Google Apps with Wordpress. The project aims to build :

   - Google Apps user Management in Wordpress.
   - Enhanced Integration of Google Apps ( Gmail, Google Calendar, Google
   docs, Google Spreadsheet, Google Form ( part of spreadsheet ) )

*Description : Google Apps integration in Wordpress*

My Goal is to make a package of modules , to Integrate Google Apps in a
manner , which increases the functionality and simplifies the ease of
management of Wordpress , concerning the organization who are using
Wordpress and Google apps , or may Use in Future. My aim comprises of 2 sub
goals :

   - *Google Apps User Account management :*

This part aims to Provide an easy and flexible management of Google Apps
account from Wordpress. All the user account management is done using Google
Provisioning API v2 .

   1. User Accounts
         - Add User Account
            1. User Account can be added by Uploading an Spreadsheet of
            First name, Last name, and Random password.
            2. Ldap Integration : An Extension module of Ldap module , If
            user details ( First name , last name and secondary email)
can be retrieved
            from LDAP structure .
            3. The normal way : User can himself Enter Details and Fill in
            Desired Email-ID, while registering.
         - Delete User Account : Admin can Delete User who are members of a
         Google App Group mapped to his role in Wordpress.
         - Update User Account Details
         - Retrieve User Account Details
      2. Nick Names
         - Add Nicknames
         - Delete Nicknames Account
         - Update Nicknames Account
         - Retrieve Nicknames Account Details
      3. Groups
         - Add Groups According to Roles : Groups of Google Apps mapped to
         roles in Wordpress. For eg. : while registering , if a
Student registers and
         has a role *student*, and similarly teachers. the Google apps
         accounts could be groups into 2 type also , students and
teachers, hence
         mapping Google apps account with Wordpress role.
         - Delete Groups : Admin can delete group mapped to a role
         - Update Groups
         - Retrieve Groups Details
         - Add Members to Groups based or role. Admin can also disable this
         Role mapping property.
      4. Registration Process : A sub-module of Registration module to
      enable User to register for Google Apps Also , while going through the
      registration process of Wordpress. For example. User could be asked for
      Desired email-id and then, his New email-id ( Of Google Apps )
and randomly
      Generated password will be mailed to the secondary email of user Or
      Displayed there it self. The desired password can also be
enabled from admin
      page.
      5. User profile : A CCK field of type Gapp Email id , Nick name Added
      in Profile page. All the Details like, Email, Nickname, Group
stored in The
      modules database
   - *Google Apps Direct Integration :*

This part comprises of integrating the Google apps ( Gmail, docs,
spreadsheet, calendar, only . There are other google apps also ) with
Wordpress .

   1. Gmail
         - Block of List of Mails in inbox.( Semi-expandable preview of mail
         content, sender, date and time. Customizable from Admin page
) On opening
         mails from the block it-self, open the Inbox with the mail
right there. (
         user Does not need to Login in his Google Apps gmail Account
separately , if
         SSO is On , Else the Apps gmail login will appears for authorization).
         - To show "Read and unread" Or "unread" mails can be configured
         from Admin page.
      2. Docs
         - Block of List Of Google docs with document type display also.
         - Create, Delete and Download any document from the block.
         - Google Apps Docs homePage Link on the Profile page.
      3. Spreadsheet
         - Export The CSV / XLS format Result of Webform module to Google
         Spreadsheets. hence It is then be edited online, share and
published too.
         - List of Spreadsheet Already available in the Block as Above
      4. Calendar
         - Block of Google Calendar. The Display can be administered based
         on features like, Agenga, month-wise, week-wise
         - Manage the Calendar under a Google Apps account, or other that
         are always embedded. Keep a record of each embedded calendar
and type of
         display it is currently. Change the calendar settings from
admin page of
         module, without going back to Google calendar, and
re-embedding with new
         code
         - Embed an Event Publisher button for any event in Google Calendar.
         Its is similar to Skype's -> make a call <- button, which add
a particular
         event to your calendar. ( in future , it this feature can be
integrated with
         Wordpress events and Wordpress calendar ). Admin can Keep a
track of all the
         event publisher button put on any page.
      5. Other
         - Manage embedded *Google Spreadsheet form, Presentation* ( Google
         docs , PDF and not embeddable currently, though Published web page can
         embedded, which can be worked around in future ) in Wordpress
. Insert Any
         where and keep a track of location of each form ( i.e. node (
URL ) , where
         it is embedded ). Directly Get the result of the webform
downloaded from the
         admin page in form of spreadsheet , Or go to live spreadsheet
Or go the
         respective presentation.
         - Add an Upload i.e " Open as Google Docs " link just aside any
         attached file ( document, spreadsheet, presentation) .
Wordpress will check
         the size of attachment, just before requesting it for upload.
Administrator
         can enable/disable this property. ( In future, admin could
also set the
         "Open as google docs " functionality available specifically
usable for a
         document type , or by a specific Wordpress role . )


Warm Regards
Aditya Sharma

Aditya,

That looks like a significant amount of API work, but I can definitely see
the value in that kind of integration.  Do you have any experience working
with the Google API?

I'm also concerned about trying to integrate with *all* of the Google Apps
systems.  Particularly since you seem to be targeting UI functions and not
just integrating the Google UI.  The Gmail integration by itself would be
fairly heavy ... you're basically proposing to build a webmail client into
WordPress that uses Gmail to send/receive messages.  So while you have a
fairly robust list of features, I'm wondering just how feasible it is for a
GSoC project.

Message-ID: <109676D2-1341-4B34-9D90-60C83A0D343C@gmail.com>

Running into a strange problem using Scribu's awesome plugin.

I have a post type called Songs, and Songs can be associated with either Albums or Projects. 

On the Album pages, I'm calling p2p_get_connected($post->ID, 'to'), and am getting the correct list of Songs associated with the Album.

When I use the same call on Project pages, if the given Project has no Songs associated with it, I'm getting a list back of all Songs instead of none. If the Project does have Songs associated with it, I get the correct list of songs back.

Anyone else run into this problem?

Thanks,
Josh

I just had to point out your quote from US copyright law at the start
of the page pretty much?cancelled?your whole?argument. The key
adjectives:?recast,?transformed, and?adapted.?A plugin or theme
doesn't do any of the following to the core code.

Adapt -?to?make?suitable?to?requirements?or?conditions;?adjust?or
modify?fittingly:
Recast - to?remodel?or?reconstruct?(a?literary?work,?document,sentence,?etc.).
Transform - ?to?change?in?form,?appearance,?or?structure;?metamorphose.
               -  to?change?in?condition,?nature,?or?character;?convert.
               -  to?change?into?another?substance;?transmute.

Simply put, to say my code is a?derivative of someone elses ?because
it calls a function that someone else has has defined is just crazy in
my eyes. I can have 1000 lines of code and only 1 of them being
add_action and all of a sudden it's gotta be GPL? Nah don't think so.
What if someone else also creates a function called add_action does
that automaticaly become a?derivative ?

Also people seem to think FSF and?SFLC are always right, bad news they
aren't they have opinions like other people do and until a judge
agrees with them they are just as wrong as we are. Also have to note
that WordPress Fondation haven't taken legal action againist non GPL
plugins. Could this because the GPL can't apply to the WordPress core
due to non GPL compatible code [1] and copyrighted lyrics? But none of
this really matters because chances of a case going to court for not
being GPL compliant is slim to none.

You might want to re-read the entire post again (note: it's several pages;
not just one page). You seem to think I come to exactly the *opposite*
conclusion that I actually reach.

Beyond that: I really won't debate the merits here on the list. (I'm trying
to be good about that; honest!) I'll be happy to discuss in the comments to
the post, if you would like.

Subject: [wp-hackers] resetting post IDs
Message-ID: <4D7FDFAA.2050902@unFocus.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to manually mix two installs of Wordpress with two sets of 
posts that have overlapping IDs.

I'm comfortable updating the IDs in the necessary places - the question 
is, what are those places?

So far, the easy ones are:
posts->ID
postmeta->post_id
comments->comment_post_ID

Additionally, it looks like some of the object_id values may need to be 
updated in the various terms and taxonomy tables.

Anyone know for sure?

Using the import/export feature simply didn't work, and I didn't try the 
various plugins. I'm trying to retain the IDs of the larger data set 
(which is what I'm importing to the smaller one) - because they are 
using a permalink structure in an existing site that relies on that data 
(at least I think it does - /archives/post_id? - I'll need to check on 
that).

Thanks,

Kevin N.

I think at the end of the day there is no clear cut answer. Do what you plan to do, just beware of the potential backlash from the community. Until someone goes to court over whether or not plugins and themes are derivatives of WordPress we will never know. In a way it makes me wish thesis had held out and gone to court as Matt threatened. I don't really wish that on anyone but at least we would have had some clearer answers....

This list is not the place to find the answer though.

Looks like term_relationships->object_id will need to be updated too.

Don't forget about posts->post_parent for revisions.

I think you've nailed all of them.

And, if you're using featured images/post thumbnails, the postmeta on the post that points to the thumbnail's post id needs to be updated (sorry I can't recall the meta key). 

You might consider, instead, doing this via the wp export and import. That will update post IDs as it goes.

What role can trademark play in protecting a business centered around open source? RedHat heavily restricts the use of its trademark, which impacts how a derivative can market and refer to their software. Brand plays a big role in how people view a given product, especially among professionals, and there is strong legal precedence for fighting trademark violations in the courts.

Coupled with support services that are only available to purchasers, I think there is room for a solid business if there is real value in the plugin.

Just for reference -

We reject all attachments 'in-and-out' over 10mb here in our domain.
This is also the default MS Exchange value for message size, so you'll
find this is quite a popular figure.

Files over that size we encourage our staff/clients to use ShareFile or
sFTP.

It will also depend on the configuration of the sending and receiving
MTA's as they may also limit email size

I'd just like to mention (both to you and the rest of the list) that I
recently patched wp_mail() so that you can send multipart emails much
easier, with an array as the body parameter (keys of 'text/plain' and
'text/html' with content in the values). I don't believe Westi got
around to committing it (*hint hint*), but I believe it is going into
the next version.

Subject: [wp-hackers] disabling wpautop
Message-ID: <4D811C43.4060501@unFocus.com>

Hi there,

I want to kill off wpautop using a plugin.

It looks like this may be all I need to do this on the server side:

remove_filter ('the_content',  'wpautop');
remove_filter ('comment_text', 'wpautop');

But the place it's most annoying, is in the editor. Even the server side 
autop is not so bad, because if you use <p> in the text field, it pretty 
much leaves them alone - but if you do something like go to another 
page, switch to Rich Text mode, then go back and edit a page you set 
carefully with wpautop incompatible html code, it decimates everything 
without asking questions. Hence my quest to, as Chris Rock might say, 
turn that shit off.

Ok, so it looks like the offensive JS is this:

     pre_wpautop : function(content) {
         var t = this, o = { o: t, data: content, unfiltered: content };

         jQuery('body').trigger('beforePreWpautop', [o]);
         o.data = t._wp_Nop(o.data);
         jQuery('body').trigger('afterPreWpautop', [o]);
         return o.data;
     },

     wpautop : function(pee) {
         var t = this, o = { o: t, data: pee, unfiltered: pee };

         jQuery('body').trigger('beforeWpautop', [o]);
         o.data = t._wp_Autop(o.data);
         jQuery('body').trigger('afterWpautop', [o]);
         return o.data;
     }

My first thought was to just overwrite those functions with compatible 
functions that don't actually do the wpautop thing - but maybe it would 
be better to actually use those hooks. This is the point of this post.

What is the right way to disable this part of wpautop?

Thanks,

Kevin N.

PS If you are interested, the plan is to add an option per post to 
disable wpautop, rather than going all nuclear.

Remove the 'to' from the end of the URL, it should read .png rather than .pngto

I almost missed post_parent - luckily, Wordpress complained. :-)

I think I'm clear on the thumbnails - there are none in use.

Thanks for help!

This seems to keep the editor from stripping out <p> tags when you 
switch between tabs. That's a start. :-)

(function() {
     var unFltr, unFltrPre;
     jQuery('body').bind({
         beforePreWpautop: function(e, o) {
             unFltrPre = o.data;
         },
         afterPreWpautop: function(e, o) {
             o.data = unFltrPre;
         },
         beforeWpautop: function(e, o) {
             unFltr = o.data;
         },
         afterWpautop: function(e, o) {
             o.data = unFltr;
         }
     });
})();

  Piyush I have been thinking on this for a while, a couple of features
which would make wordpress a better CMS would be
  - Custom menus(Like in Joomla)
  - Ability to show different widgets on different pages.
    For now this can be done using using custom page template, but the
ability to do such changes for the admin side would be nice.
   (more needed obviously)
 This is all i can think of for now. This will be a small set of features to
implement so i need more inputs.
 awating more criticism and inputs

Thank you

Dayanand.

IMHO probably the biggest additions would be adding plugin dependency and
multi db support with the core itself.

Subject: [wp-hackers] taxonomy template, but which one i already see?
Message-ID: <AANLkTim-G-RGRmyqcu+zOK+7u6SpL5xkQGf5zxvHhpD5@mail.gmail.com>

hello

i have custom post type in my wordpress with custom taxonomy called
'kategoria-imprez' (eng.  'event types'). this taxonomy can have
values like 'parties', 'meetings' etc

i prepared template file taxonomy-kategoria-imprez.php to list all
events grouped by taxonomy value. so if in url i have
example.com/?kategoria-imprez=parties it list me all posts which has
'parties' as taxonomy value

but:

on the top of this list i want to show title like "you are watching
all events from category: [here value of taxonomy]"

how to get this? i am looking for some template tag like
the_taxonomy_value() which will show me 'parties', 'meetings' etc but
i cannot find.

I use this code (from an article by Justin Tadlock [1]):

$term = get_term_by( 'slug', get_query_var( 'term' ), get_query_var(
'taxonomy' ) );
echo $term->name;

You should use get_queried_object() here, so core can do this internally.

No warnings or errors, even with wp_debug set to true, and error_reporting =

Hey guys, I've been eavesdropping on your list for several months. I KNOW
ALL YOUR SECRETS....jk

But I actually need help now, do any of you know of a way to detect the user
browsers? The site I'm working on is supposed to cater to most browsers
EXCEPT Internet Explorer.
Might there be a plugin for this already? I want to redirect all IE users to
a download page to other Browsers. Thanks in advance!

Welcome to the list Jesus,

This isn't the place for this kind of query. This list is for
discussion on hacking WordPress and core development (although often
it doesn't seem that way).

You should consult Google with your query.
http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=detect+browser

You might be best using conditional comments wrapped around a meta
redirect to target IE specifically.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wpautop is NOT the problem.
Message-ID: <4D837650.8000904@unFocus.com>

So after looking into this more carefully, to try and disable what I 
thought was the problem, I don't think the idea of wpautop is the 
problem, nor is the server side (php) implementation. If I just use the 
text editor, and save back to the server, things tend to work out.

The problem seems to be the javascript implementation of wpautop that is 
triggered between TinyMCE and the HTML tab.

The question then is, how to make this work more consistently like the 
PHP version.

I think this could be handled with an Ajax call to the actual server 
side wpautop. But the JS version actually addresses another problem, 
which is that content coming out of TinyMCE needs to be formatted (it's 
also doing some other kind of filtering that I haven't looked closely 
enough at to understand yet) - that could be handled separately before 
or after the server side wpautop tag-back.

Anyway, has anyone looked into this? I'd be a lot of the complaining 
about wpautop is actually complaints about the client side 
implementation of it, and not about wpautop in general.

I'd be happy to attempt a solution, if there is any interest.

Are you talking about something like the way the TinyMCE Advanced plugin handles maintaining p and br in the editor?

If you're switching between Visual and HTML editors, and you haven't
customized your TinyMCE configuration, you *WILL* run into problems.

I would suggest either not switching between editors, or else customizing
your TinyMCE configuration such that you avoid the changes that it makes
when switching from HTML to Visual.

That's correct, you will run into problems. But why is it like that? It 
doesn't have to be - if I disable the WordPress JS, TinyMCE doesn't mess 
with my stuff. From what I can tell, it seems like it should be quite 
possible to have it both ways - it would take a source formatting step, 
followed by autop and nop.

There are other things an async call to the server would solve, besides 
just making it consistent - for example, there are some hooks (adding 
elements to the block element list) that are ignored client side (and 
the way the js function is written, access to that list is almost 
impossible, unless you really really know JavaScript). An async call to 
the server side wpautop could theoretically fix that.

Do you have any links to resources that explain how to customize the 
TinyMCE instance in WP? I've been wanting to add a button for a <code> 
tag (there's one in the quicktags, but not in TinyMCE, and I use it 
pretty often), but the process of customizing TinyMCE buttons has been 
pretty opaque to me.

Here's what I use for my custom configuration:
http://pastebin.com/TwcvdGvj

<http://pastebin.com/TwcvdGvj>Here's the TinyMCE documentation regarding
configuration:
http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/wiki.php/Configuration
*
*Basically, just about anything that can be found in the Configuration wiki
can be modified through the $init array, which is pulled from/returned to
the tiny_mce_before_init filter hook. I'm sure I got started from someone's
blog post somewhere, but I apologize; I didn't put it in my inline docs like
I normally do, so I don't remember.

I found these pretty comprehensive, both addressing using a custom button
for a shortcode, but should be easy enough to use it for <code> instead:
http://brettterpstra.com/adding-a-tinymce-button/ and
http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/wordpress/wordpress-shortcodes-the-right-way/

I haven't made my own buttons, but I have added some of the bundled TinyMCE
ones and pre-built plugins. I found dissecting the source of the TinyMCE
Advanced plugin (another mention, jeez) to be the most helpful, especially
with keeping things in a certain order instead of just tacking stuff on at
the end of a toolbar.

The WordPress source itself is also a great reference for all the init
options :)

My policy is to make sure all content works in both types of editor. You can
try to never use the visual editor on a given site, and you can set up a
plugin that temporarily stops a certain undesireable behavior within it, but
you shouldn't count on either solution working forever. Eventually someone
is likely open the post with visual editor enabled and if that will ruin
your content then you have a big problem (and in many cases just opening the
post with the visual editor will break your stuff, be it a special class on
something or a youtube embed that only works in HTML editor).

The only thing we should count on is that in the future anything built to
work with both HTML and Visual editors should continue to work. That's a
reasonable demand to make of the core dev team going forward, and it's
usually not THAT hard to find workarounds for TinyMCE that still make sense.

When in doubt a quick shortcode often does wonders, as can divs with classes
(which tinymce doesn't seem to touch in my experience).

I would love to see a core patch for this :)

I miss the code button when using the TinyMCE editor all the time.

I'm not sure how it could. Here is the function body for autop in JS:

_wp_Autop : function(pee) {
     var blocklist = 
'table|thead|tfoot|caption|col|colgroup|tbody|tr|td|th|div|dl|dd|dt|ul|ol|li|pre|select|form|blockquote|address|math|p|h[1-6]|fieldset|legend|hr';

     if ( pee.indexOf('<object') != -1 ) {
         pee = pee.replace(/<object[\s\S]+?<\/object>/g, function(a){
             return a.replace(/[\r\n]+/g, '');
         });
     }

     pee = pee.replace(/<[^<>]+>/g, function(a){
         return a.replace(/[\r\n]+/g, ' ');
     });

     // Protect pre|script tags
     if ( pee.indexOf('<pre') != -1 || pee.indexOf('<script') != -1 ) {
         pee = pee.replace(/<(pre|script)[^>]*>[\s\S]+?<\/\1>/g, 
function(a) {
             return a.replace(/(\r\n|\n)/g, '<wp_temp_br>');
         });
     }

     pee = pee + '\n\n';
     pee = pee.replace(/<br \/>\s*<br \/>/gi, '\n\n');
     pee = pee.replace(new RegExp('(<(?:'+blocklist+')(?: [^>]*)?>)', 
'gi'), '\n$1');
     pee = pee.replace(new RegExp('(</(?:'+blocklist+')>)', 'gi'), 
'$1\n\n');
     pee = pee.replace(/<hr( [^>]*)?>/gi, '<hr$1>\n\n'); // hr is self 
closing block element
     pee = pee.replace(/\r\n|\r/g, '\n');
     pee = pee.replace(/\n\s*\n+/g, '\n\n');
     pee = pee.replace(/([\s\S]+?)\n\n/g, '<p>$1</p>\n');
     pee = pee.replace(/<p>\s*?<\/p>/gi, '');
     pee = pee.replace(new RegExp('<p>\\s*(</?(?:'+blocklist+')(?: 
[^>]*)?>)\\s*</p>', 'gi'), "$1");
     pee = pee.replace(/<p>(<li.+?)<\/p>/gi, '$1');
     pee = pee.replace(/<p>\s*<blockquote([^>]*)>/gi, '<blockquote$1><p>');
     pee = pee.replace(/<\/blockquote>\s*<\/p>/gi, '</p></blockquote>');
     pee = pee.replace(new RegExp('<p>\\s*(</?(?:'+blocklist+')(?: 
[^>]*)?>)', 'gi'), "$1");
     pee = pee.replace(new RegExp('(</?(?:'+blocklist+')(?: 
[^>]*)?>)\\s*</p>', 'gi'), "$1");
     pee = pee.replace(/\s*\n/gi, '<br />\n');
     pee = pee.replace(new RegExp('(</?(?:'+blocklist+')[^>]*>)\\s*<br 
/>', 'gi'), "$1");
     pee = pee.replace(/<br 
\/>(\s*<\/?(?:p|li|div|dl|dd|dt|th|pre|td|ul|ol)>)/gi, '$1');
     pee = pee.replace(/(?:<p>|<br 
?\/?>)*\s*\[caption([^\[]+)\[\/caption\]\s*(?:<\/p>|<br ?\/?>)*/gi, 
'[caption$1[/caption]');

     pee = 
pee.replace(/(<(?:div|th|td|form|fieldset|dd)[^>]*>)(.*?)<\/p>/g, 
function(a, b, c) {
         if ( c.match(/<p( [^>]*)?>/) )
             return a;

         return b + '<p>' + c + '</p>';
     });

     // put back the line breaks in pre|script
     pee = pee.replace(/<wp_temp_br>/g, '\n');

     return pee;
},

blocklist is defined right at the top of the function list, and has no 
indication of any way to extend that list.

Hmm, I'll have to look into what they are doing behind the scenes.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimYq65LT28CC97cx_VT3QP3dBvrWhraKWtHQYcY@mail.gmail.com>

I have a form on a contact page that requires a js file.  I don't want to
unnecessarily call this js file through out the site but rather only on this
page that needs it.

I don't want to call it in the page content it's self.

I figured I could do one of a couple things but I wanted to get some
feedback on what's best practice.

   - Create a shortcode in the content to grab the js file
   - put an if statement in the header with the page id
   - create a custom value that would be set to true if we want it pulled
   in

I would recommend using a custom page template for your contact page.  Then
you can enqueue your script only when that template is being used.  This way
you don't need to remember shortcodes, know the page ID in advance, or do
anything hacky with custom values.

Yeah, I'd go with the if (is_page('$arg')) {} method. I'm doing something
similar to that on a current project.

Scribu, would you mentor me if I applied for GSoC to add plugin dependency
in core and also on wordpress.org/extend/plugins ?

Hi Hackers,

I changed one of my blogs peralinks from %postname% to
%year/%month%postname% for better performance. WordPress handles the
redirection perfectly taking visitors to new permalink when the old one is
requested. My question is: How is Google going to behave towards this
change?

Although WordPress will automatically change the permalinks of each post, I don't believe it will create an HTTP 301 Redirect for the changed posts, which means that anyone with links to your posts under the old permalink structure will get 404 errors, and you'll lose all that SEO goodness.
Therefore you'll need to use a plugin like the Redirection plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/redirection/) to manage such redirects.

Thanks for the addition Dan. Well, this is exactly why I asked as I tested
that redirection worked fine for human users. As far as I know WordPress has
made the redirection plugin redundant having those features in the core, but
I don't know to what extend. Can someone please just and clarify this point.

Kindly,

Sure. WordPress does indeed generate 301 redirects for your particular case.

In the case of a 404, the redirect_canonical function tries a few
different ways to guess what permalink you really meant. If it comes
up with one, it will do a 301 redirect to the correct URL. This works
for both users and search engines.

Not all cases are covered though. So sometimes changing permalinks
won't work like this. In such a case, using a plugin that can handle
it will work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] register_*() vs. add_*()?
Message-ID: <17DE07E2-D914-4EFA-94BD-7196F3480D26@newclarity.net>

I'm trying to understand the rationale between prefixing core functions with "register_" vs. "add_" as a prefix.  I can't seem to recognize why one is used at times and the other is used at times.  Examples from core:

add_shortcode()
add_rewrite_rule()
add_action()
add_custom_background()

register_post_type()
register_taxonomy()
register_nav_menu()
register_sidebar()

I'm working on code I could envision offering up as proposed additions to core so that's why I'm interested in the difference.

Thanks in advance.

-Mike
P.S. I think I asked this question on trac before but didn't get a good answer.

This question[1] got me thinking. It seems that excanvas[2] is becoming a standard dependency for Javascript charting libraries but it is licensed with Apache 2.0, not GPL 2.

The core question I'm asking is would a plugin that is otherwise GPL licensed be denied inclusion into the WordPress plugin repository if it includes excanvas because of the Apache 2.0 license? Or given the circumstances would the potential license conflicts be overlooked?

I'm guessing that it would not be allowed.

After all, even with the official WordPress License "clarification", the
official policy is that even GPLv3 Plugins will not be allowed to be hosted
in the Plugin Repository:
http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/clarification-in-licensing-language/#comment-15633

But perhaps the stance will change?

The real reason is probably just time and different people writing
different bits.

But if you wanted to standardize a bit, I'd say that registering
something "creates" it without taking any other real action, while
adding something more often causes other sub-thing to happen. Of
course, there's exceptions and this is open to interpretation, but
that's about the gist of it, I think.

Well I think it's safe to say Mark Jaquith wasn't thinking since GPL
v3 is later than GPL v2 and his response says it has to be GPL - more
specificallt GPL v2 or later. Also the plugin about [1] states it has
to be compatable with GPL which according to gnu [2] Apache V 2.0 is.

Hi Iain,

Thanks.  So in a nutshell am I reading that you think it should be okay to include Apache v2.0 licensed dependency into a GPLv2 licensed plugin and that it should be allowed in the repository?

Can anyone official confirm this?

I would mentor you, if I was accepted as a mentor (not sure at the moment
what my status is).

The bigger problem would be getting the project to be accepted at all.

Official answer: As Pete pointed out, The Apache 2.0 license is not
compatible with the GPL version 2. So that does not meet the current
licensing criterion, which is that the license be compatible with the
GPL version 2.

I'm still deliberating about whether to relax that criterion to allow
GPLv3-only or GPLv3+ (or compatible) code. We're already in the
situation where some plugin directory code is GPLv2-only instead of
GPLv2+, so combining that plugin code with WordPress already requires
care.

If you're writing a plugin, and are able to, I strongly urge to to
license it as "GPLv2 or any later version" (GPLv2+) or just as "GPL,
any version," as that allows for maximum flexibility.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Audio RSS enclosure problem
Message-ID: <AANLkTinbrEDJe=PyO6=HAiq7+ZV8DRHC=epeMUjD2bHM@mail.gmail.com>

So I have a client with a website for their podcast. To make it easy,
I just have them upload their audio file to a post and then use
get_children to grab the audio attachment and display it where I want
on the page.   That way they don't have to deal with custom fields or
inserting code or anything like that.

Only problem... WP will only auto-create the audio enclosure in the
RSS feed if you have the mp3 linked from the post content.  Since I'm
using attachments, it won't auto-create the enclosure.  Any ideas?

Bryan, using the publish hook you could add the link directly to the post with the $content value. This would accomplish both the automation you're seeking and also trigger the audio enclosure.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the detailed reply. 

So we are writing a plugin from scratch for a well-loved SaaS vendor and need to incorporate charts at their request. We looked at flot which includes Apache 2.0 excanvas. Explicitly, since you talk of relaxing, would including flot in a plugin keep that plugin out of the WordPress plugin repository?

-Mike

Right now, it would, yes.

Sure. But I was thinking more about forks and core/plugin bundles that
third parties might want to distribute. But it's a very small concern.

Denying inclusion of plugins just so that other third-parties can make
bundles without doing their homework seems even less of a legitimate reason
than the "would prevent inclusion in core" one.

It would make certain bundles *impossible*, no matter how much
homework you did. GPLv2-only and GPLv3+ can't be combined. But I'm not
sure that outweighs the benefit that would be realized by allowing
GPLv3 and GPLv3-compatible code.

I infer from his comment that he was referring to such downstream
distributors doing their homework regarding what they could and could not
bundle with a WordPress derivative. (In other words, I think he's 100% in
agreement with you on this point.)

Regardless, I don't at all understand why it would be the responsibility of
WordPress.org to act as a clearinghouse for Plugins that are or are not
eligible to be bundled with a distributed WordPress derivative, nor do I
understand why WordPress.org would even *want* to assume that
responsibility, especially considering that to do so would be to consider
that responsibility more important than the opportunity to provide otherwise
completely legitimate, useful Plugins to the tens of millions of end users
of WordPress, the vast majority of whom will never know about a Plugin
unless it is included in the Plugin repository.*

So, I am quite happy to hear that you are reconsidering this policy.

Chip

Thanks Christopher.  I followed the steps here:
http://www.wprecipes.com/how-to-automatically-insert-content-after-each-post

And while the link to the audio was successfully added, it didn't
trigger the audio enclosure for some reason.

Could you use the "audio" Post-Format type, and then in your "audio"
Post-Format type-specific loop output, pull the attachment link into the
Post output automatically, using e.g. get_attachment_link()?

Thanks Chip, but I need to get the attachment ID dynamically, that's
why I'm using get_children.

Here's what I ended up doing, though I'm open to a more elegant
solution!  Opened /wp-includes/feed-rss2.php.  Replaced the enclosure
tag with:

<?php $mp3s = get_children('numberposts=-1&post_type=attachment&post_mime_type=audio&post_parent='.$post->ID);
if (!empty($mp3s)) : ?>

<?php foreach($mp3s as $mp3) : ?>

<?php $mp3url = $mp3->guid; $mp3header = get_headers($mp3url, 1);
$mp3size = $mp3header['Content-Length']; ?>

<enclosure url="<?php echo $mp3url; ?>" length="<?php echo $mp3size;
?>" type="audio/mpeg" />

<?php endforeach; ?>
<?php endif; ?>

Please don't hack core. That's not very elegant. There's plenty of hooks
here.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Assigning and using custom taxonomy with link object
Message-ID: <AANLkTimsEWi8bs2eNJ1M-KDrGeWcn-3cmT7BUKD6WDoo@mail.gmail.com>

I have custom post types registered as well as custom taxonomies. I have
additionally registered two of custom taxonomies for the link object. The
goal is to be able to assign the same taxonomy to a link as to a custom post
type in order to create a sidebar listing of links related to the post being
viewed.

I realize that I would need some wizardry in order to pull this relation
from the database as the links and posts are in separate tables, but, as the
terms tables are independent, and link_category is simply another taxonomy,
I assumed it would be possible.

After registering the custom taxonomies to the link object, they show up
nicely in the link editor, so, it appeared doable on that end as well.

However, I've just realized that when attempting to actually use the custom
taxonomy term metabox in the link editor, the chosen terms do not save when
update is clicked.

It would seem that there is some core code missing. The custom taxonomy
metabox shows up, but, is unusable?

I'm only experienced enough to "sense" and somewhat "see" what might be
happening in the big picture here, but, not quite jedi enough to answer my
own questions.

Does anyone out there have any idea if core will facilitate what I'm trying
to accomplish?

Any insight is appreciated~

Subject: [wp-hackers] Confused regarding ideas for GSOC 2011
Message-ID: <AANLkTikUE4yxRLsJHysNZL9Uj27exXW5dEkAjtkhqnC_@mail.gmail.com>

I am undergraduate Computer Science student. I am applying for gsoc 2011
under Wordpress. I have narrowed down on following ideas but I am not able
to decide which one will be best as a gsoc project. Please help me by
providing any comments or advice.


*My Wordpress experience*: I am using Wordpress as a blogger for last 18
months and I started developing plugins just 5 months back. I have 1 plugin
in repo and 2 patches in trac.


1* Wordpress Android Tablet Idea*


I have gone through the present android app for mobiles and I think it is
dedicated for posts, comments and pages. Since exact idea was not mentioned
on idea's page. I think I could try and develop complete admin section
interface including features like plugin settings, widget, user management,
etc since we are dealing with tablets. We just need to implement a clean
client side for XML-rpc calls.

Officially Android 3.0 is for tablets but many tablets are running on hacked
version of android 2.0*.  Do you expect developer to consider those tablets
as well.*

*
*

*My progress:* I am familiar with Android for mobiles but have not released
any application but I am really interested in both Android and Wordpress.



2 *Move WordPress
*

*
*

This idea can be broken down into 2 category:-


*1 With FTP: *It is very straight forwards process. Last year someone tried
this and released a plugin (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/automatic-migration/

) but that plugin lacks certain features of Wordpress 3 and above like
Wordpress network, etc. I could extend previous work and implement all these
features.

*2 Without FTP: *With this plugin everything will be from admin section. My
major concern is that I want to make it work in cases where blog admin may
not have access to FTP details e.g. a student blog on college domain,
wordpress.com

, etc. Plugin settings may pose some issues.


* *I have developed a backup plugin and submitted in repository (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/backup-and-move/
) .

* *

3* User Notification and support*


This idea is an extension of "New User Walkthrough". Instead of keeping a
module only for new installation we could keep it this way. We will create a
*Health Index* for Wordpress installation which initially will be determined
by tasks like pick a theme, change your password, edit your tagline, choose
your comment settings, etc. After all this new user tasks notifications like
availability of updates of Wordpress , important plugins like Akismet ,
pending comments , etc will determine Health Index. Depending on Health
Index user may be send email/sms notifications like Wordpress installation
is in Critical Stage, etc.

*
*

Message-ID: <AANLkTinD4qgLnz=X1kB0e_vMLA0dq75V=j_4HcSNmwWo@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

My name is Pascal Chatterjee and I would like to work on developing a
version of the Wordpress application for Android tablets as a Google Summer
of Code project.

I've had a quick look at the code for the existing Android application and
it seems to me that it should be possible to keep the same logic - XML-RPC
communication with the backend etc - while rewriting all the UI elements to
use the new Fragments API. With a bit of work it should be possible to
create an application that will be able to dynamically adapt its UI to both
mobile phones and tablets, instead of having to create a new tablet
application from scratch. This won't even affect backwards compatibility
with older versions of Android as Google is making the Fragments API
available as a static library that can be bundled with the apk.

Let me know if you have any feedback about this idea.

Thanks,

Pascal.

Hi,
Moving a WP from one install to another server for a new domain means
changing the guid in [wp_]posts, updating site_url n home.
Taking mysql dump, zipping wp-contents and importing all of that on the new
server right?

Is there any issue I left out above?

couldn't you conditionally add_post_meta() w/ your same get_children 
() request
(& get_headers values) you used to hack feed-rss2.php?

or (this next is stating-the-obvious, so you've probly already  
considered):
ask your users to Insert Into Post -- and let WP handle the enclosure
(assuming they're using the Media Uploader).

Or you just use the Export feature WordPress provides.

Doesn't include plugins and themes, though, but saves you from changing

I usually do a MySQL find (old URL) and replace (new URL) on wp_posts, wp_postmeta, and wp_options:

UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace(post_content, 'http://olddomain.com/', 'http://newdomain.com/');
UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = replace(guid, 'http://olddomain.com/', 'http://newdomain.com/');
UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = replace(meta_value, 'http://olddomain.com/', 'http://newdomain.com/');
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = replace(option_value, 'http://olddomain.com/', 'http://newdomain.com/');

Actually there is no reason you need to change the guid.  A guid is
literally a globally unique identifier.  It just happens to be a URL
in this case, but should never be treated as a URL.  Not that there is
anything wrong with changing it, but it's not necessary.

I know this has been mentioned before, but it's worth repeating! This
tool works great for changing URLs when moving WordPress.

We've also used it for renaming blogs within a Multisite network, and
it has worked well, too.

For plugin and other options, we can unserialize, replace and serialize
again. post back to keep it clean, but if we are doing that.
why not use [wp_site_url] so that in future installs, we donot need to do
this replace anymore

Only if the plug-in or theme extends the API.  There's no generic "get all
settings" call because it doesn't make sense to have one.  But any plug-in
and theme can add their own XML-RPC calls to the API.  It really depends on
what the author intends to do.

Is it possible for XML-RPC to act as a file access mechanism or just zip a
particular directory temporarily and later on delete in.
If yes then do wordpress already have such a capability ?
Can we implement such a capability in core ??

Hi hackers,

It's quite a while now that every time I mean to use the dynamic_sidebar()
functions I end up using dynamic_content() and I only get aware when I get
an error message on the browsers.

Don't you share the same feeling with me that it's time to generalise a
little the dynamic_sidebar() function since widgets have really site wide
use?

PS: To have an idea how much I get messed up, here is the original first
sentence from this email:
It's quite a while now that every time I mean to use the ***
dynamic_content()*** functions ...

I'm not quite sure what you mean here.  RPC stands for Remote Procedure
Call, so really you can make WordPress do just about anything via XML-RPC if
you have the right method calls defined in the API.  How would you want it
to act as a file access mechanism?

We only implement things in core if they have a broad use.  If it's an edge
use case, it's likely better suited for a plugin.

Sir ,

I am working out options for Move Wordpress plugin when source wordpress
installation doesn't provide with FTP details like wordpress.com. So i was
thinking whether settings could be transferred using xml-rpc.

Yes, settings can be transferred via XML-RPC.  You'd send them the same way
you'd send post or page content.  But for the Move WordPress idea you'd need
a setup on one site to package and send the information and a setup on the
other site to receive and process the information.  Transferring files would
be more complicated.  You could probably send the file location information
from site 1 to site 2 and have site 2 use the WordPress HTTP API to pull in
the file.  This gives you the option to use fopen() or cUrl and a couple of
other systems to GET the file and store it somewhere.

And that doubt regarding Android 3.0 since Officially Honeycomb is for
tablets but some tablets are using hacked Android 2.2 so if we go by
Google's word and develop using 3.0 UI wil be aweseome to say the least but
if we use 2.2 UI won't be that good although that is very easy to develop
considering wordpress already have a android app for mobile phones.

I have experience with iPad. App developed with iPhone SDK 3 can be directly
posted to ipad. All UI feature will be automatically taken care of.

I won't be at all upset if someone jumps in with fresh ideas.

Sir ,

What i feel is last year Move Idea was implemented but it had many
drawbacks. So i thought i would break my idea into categories like
1 With FTP - similar as last year but removing bugs.
2 Without FTP -  this will be comparatively slower

I think packaging part at site 1 could be added into core ??

While I love the idea of someone working on one of the mobile apps, I
think a single person trying to tackle a complete rebuild of the admin
UI is way bigger than is going to get done during a GSoC project. From
reading the description on Codex[1] I think all that's being suggested
is to take the current app, and make it work on Android Tablets
properly, taking into account different sized screen, any variations
in UX that might make sense with more space (or with changed aspect
ratios etc) and call it a day.

HTH.

Thanks Beau.

I thinks that's pretty straight forward to do.
Do you expect applicant to have released any android apps ?? How can i show
i am worthy ??

Too far. The spirit of the query is totally a valid use of wp-hackers: "what
is the best practice for browser detection in wordpress? Is there an API in
core?". The answer in this case comes down to no, there is nothing in core,
and the information he needed was generic and thus not really appropriate
for the list. That is still a valid answer to a valid WP-Hackers question.

Core development discussion has to happen on trac or the p2 dev blog or else
it is considered invalid. WP-Hackers is a discussion list for people who
write code for and with WordPress, please don't try to tell people to go
away if they are asking questions that involve hacking and WP.

Nice script.

I hope you don't mind if I share some thoughts on it:

You are taking some steps to replace the GUID for the posts. However, 
the GUID value, even if it has the old URL in there, really does not 
need to be changed.  In fact it is probably better to just leave it as 
is.  Your script would run faster if you didn't bother to change it. 
(That said, I've done the same thing in earlier migration scripts of my 
own).

The major issue I see is that you do not unserialize option_value while 
you are updating the options table.  The problem with this is that 
because serialized strings encode the length of each string value, a 
simple replacement will corrupt the entire serialized value.  So if your 
script is run on a blog that has "Welcome to blahblahblah.com" in a text 
widget and you str_replace it with "Welcome to blah.com", the new site 
will have lost all widgets on every sidebar.  This could also be the 
case for someone linking to a privacy policy in theme options. If they 
type in a full URL instead of a relative url, then you lose all of the 
theme options.

Serialized values are a MAJOR annoyance to anyone who regularly 
manipulates the database directly.  This is a very common issue in 
migration tools/tutorials. Talking about it here spreads the word...

Last year I was discussing this on the mailing list and Otto suggested a
really good way of allowing this.

function maybe_unserialize( $original ) {
       if ( is_serialized( $original ) ) // don't attempt to unserialize
       {
               $fixed = preg_replace_callback(
                       '!(?<=^|;)s:(\d+)(?=:"(.*?)";(
?:}|a:|s:|b:|i:|o:|N;))!s',
                       'serialize_fix_callback',
                       $original );
               return @unserialize( $fixed );
       }
       return $original;
}

The problem is when the user wouldn't want to change the domain.
Should I try to replace domains within post_content (interlinked posts) ?

Hi Piyush,

You can also look at using this:

http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/119/easily-move-a-wordpress-install-from-development-to-production/182#182

I've been using it very effectively for months, and it is hookable to allow you to do custom migrations.

Hope this helps.

-Mike

Hi Brian,

A quick reply to your comments:

I don't really think the script needs optimising - this is a run-once kind
of thing and therefore the speed isn't important, at least to me. I change
the GUID for completeness & to make sure there are no issues with plugins
which misuse the GUID as a URL.

The major issue I see is that you do not unserialize option_value while you
> are updating the options table.  The problem with this is that because

Nowhere in the script does it do a find and replace across the whole options
table. It only updates home and siteurl, therefore doesn't come across the
serialisation issue.

I've not seen plugins which put absolute URLs in the options table, but no
doubt there are some out there. So this would probably be a good addition.
Anyone got any examples of plugins which do this?

At the moment Migrate! is just an old script that I have been using for ages
to do the simple task of updating database values after migrating a site.
All I did prior to putting it on my blog was tidy the code a little and
update the UI so hopefully its self explanatory.

I do hope to turn it into a full plugin with many more features, I know
there are plenty of things out there that do what Migrate! does & lots of
projects like this though :)

I'm personally not a big fan of renaming things just because we can.
Especially while the widgets UI is relatively restrictive, I don't think
it's time to increase churn and ambiguity. Something like 'widget area'
might be better, but even then, I wouldn't support any renaming without it
being triggered by real changes to the API and UI.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [GSoC 2011]  Intention for application
Message-ID: <4D86622C.2060202@gmail.com>

     Hello, my name's Mihai Chereji and I'm an undergraduate Software 
Engineering student from Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

     I'm really interested in participating in GSoC (and general 
involvement in WP) from this summer.

     There are 2 of the proposed ideas which caught my eye. I'm also 
working on my own idea.

     I'm interested in working on the Moving WP idea, as this has been a 
bane for me as a WP dev for some time. (moving client sites from local 
to production servers). I realize this isn't the only use case; However 
I'd like to take this a step further: a plugin for syncing/moving a dev, 
a staging, and a production server for the same site, using whichever 
protocol's available (ftp or ssh).

     Why not use some sort of scm,you ask? I haven't been able to find 
something similar (and easy) for the database, and that is part of the 
pain, actually. This plug-in would allow to push/pull files, 
databases/content, together or separately, to any of the other servers 
configured for a particular install.

However, this is prety similar to Mike Schinkel's already existing 
plugin (which he just posted - 
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/119/easily-move-a-wordpress-install-from-development-to-production/182#182 
), so I'm not sure this could fill an entire GSoC time-frame, so I'm 
probably going to focus on my other proposals.


I'm also interested in updating the file uploader to use the File API, 
where available (falling back to the flash uploader/simple uploader). 
I'm figuring searching for a capable library (or write my own, in case 
nothing surfaces - highly unlikely) should be done before the actual 
coding period begins.

This could be extended to doing simple file manipulation straight on the 
client - resizing images so he doesn't send huge images to his site, 
saving bandwidth, maybe cutting an audio file to the length he needs 
before sending it up. Simple things which would save the user some 
hassle. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Thanks,

Mihai

I think ideally the student would be able to demonstrate that they
have some experience working on Android, although it's not a 100%
requirement. We have had students accepted previously who had never
worked on WordPress and they turned out great.

to go about achieving the desired goal.

Check out Backup Buddy.

You install it, do backups (it's great!) but the best is if you need to move
it, you export and it creates a file.
Execute that file on the new box and it installs WordPress and everything
you had..easy peasy.

Yes, you do not need to have WordPress installed in the new location. Very
slick.

Barrett - Yeah, I want to avoid the later.  The former could work, I
could auto-create and populate the custom field for new posts.  But
I'd have go back to the 30+ posts that my client's already created and
manually add it to those.

Not many people really use the Links anymore, so it's kind of dead.
While it's still there for now, I expect it to disappear or get
converted to a custom post type in some future version of WP.

I'm not a fan either, but this seems to become a need now that widgets are
used everywhere in the website. I just thought it was time this was
discussed and I'm pretty sure that renaming will become more difficult later
than it is now.

Its more or less what I wanted to write. Some cleanup and it'll be good to
go :)
Seems I have very less amount of work left to do for the project. Not sure
if the project will last a full term or not.
hmm going by the plugins and stuff already available, it seems that we just
need to take the best of these and integrate it together with some
additional features

The problem I've had with moving a site from development to production (and back again) has always been with the serialized data for plugins and widgets. When the data's serialized, it includes a string count. This isn't a problem if the domain name is going to stay the same, but if the number of characters in the name does change (e.g. foo-dev.bar.com to foo.bar.com) then the serialized data counts are off. That causes PHP errors when it tries to unserialize the data; that in turn can cause plugins to load without any of their setting information.

This can be a big headache when moving large sites through the dev/stage/prod migration path. I've handled it in the past with a script that loads the serialized data from a test database, then re-serializes it with the new URL.

Hmmm, using the links table for a list of links is somehow bad?

Do you have any stats to back that up?

For example, on WordPress.com how many sites have links in the wp_links
table other than the defaults?

I wouldn't like to see this changed. Sidebars are just content and have
always been able to be placed anywhere in a site. I can see how confusion
can arise for people who only ever use dynamic_sidebar() for menus or other
supplementary content to be displayed along the side of a page. This kind of
use could lead some people into thinking the name refers to a side of a
page.

Although I don't know the background to the reasons this name was chosen,
its an appropriate name for the function it serves. The definition of
"sidebar" is:
a : a short news story or graphic accompanying and presenting sidelights of
a major story
b : something incidental : sidelight <a sidebar to the essay's central
theme>
If you think of the meaning of "sidebar" and don't think of it as
necessarily being on the side of a page then its much easier to understand.

I'm firmly in the camp of, "if it aint broke, don't fix it" and prefer to
leave names alone.

I don't know about naming conventions, but I thought I'd chime in since we're on the subject of widgets.  The biggest issue I (and several colleagues have) with the widgetized sidebars is that you cannot associate widgets with the name of the widget area you've put them in.  So if you delete an entire section (or add a new one) the widgets get all rearranged and you have to redo them all.

For example, say I have a widgetized section registered for "Home" and "Contact", and I have several widgets set to just show on the "Home" and "Contact" Pages, and use some custom code to pull only that section of widgets to the page it's named after. Now say I decide I want the stuff ion the "Home" section to just be default, so I get rid of the "Home" and all that remains is "Contact."  When you do that, you'll see that all the "Home" widgets are now in the "Contact" section, and all that was previously in "Contact" is gone (it's actually *not* - it's still in the database, but there's nothing associated with it, so you can't see them anymore until you re-register another widget area to populate it with the stuff).

Looking into it, all I've seen is that each widgetized area, when registered, is registered as "sidebar1", "sidebar2" etc. and the naming conventions given in the functions.php file (when registering the widget) are ignored - the name is basically for display purposes only.  It'd be nice, I think, if the name given - IF one is given - was used (the numerical sidebars would just be the defaults) instead, so when you move, add or delete these sections the widgets associated with them remain intact.  I think that's a more pressing issue than whether or not it's called a "sidebar widget", IMO.

That's just my 2 cents (if it's worth even that! :) )

The intent was not for a "Mr. WordPress" at all. The intent was for a

Dan Roundhill, who heads up the Android app, is happy to discuss 
individual project ideas. This is the first year we've included the 
mobile apps in our GSoC Ideas list at all, so we didn't come up with 
specific ideas for the Codex page, as we weren't sure if there would 
even be any interest. Dan Roundhill and the other mobile app developers 
will be joining the list, but we'll also be setting up some IRC chats 
for potential students to talk with all the mentors, including those for 
mobile apps, and that would be a good place to get into detailed 
questions about projects, since most of the people on wp-hackers don't 
work on mobile apps.

In the meantime, you can connect directly with the Android devs at 
http://android.wordpress.org/development/

Message-ID: <2F59774A-FFEA-4A52-ABC0-FBDA68C05FA1@automattic.com>

Hi Pascal,
That could be an excellent fit for a GSoC project. I manage the Android app and we have been getting quite a few requests to optimize the app experience for Honeycomb tablets lately.

Do you have any experience creating Android apps?  If not at least some Java experience would be preferred.  You're right about the fragments API, which would require that we bump up our minimum version to Android 1.6 which isn't too big of a deal since most devices are at least running that now.

Let's talk further on this in the #wordpress-gsoc channel in irc.freenode.net (I'm 'mrroundhill' there), or you can find the other wp-android devs hanging out at http://dev.android.wordpress.org

I responded to a similar E-Mail you sent me directly, but thought I'd 
post this here as well:

First of all, you are not limited to one application.  You're more than 
welcome to put together an application for each of these ideas and 
submit all three.  You will only be chosen for one, so make sure to 
mention in each that you have other applications and which one you would 
most like to do.

   1. With the Android for tablets, make sure that you understand there
      are currently some limitations with WordPress's XMLRPC setup.  Be
      careful how much you bite off for this one.  As for the current
      Android App, it of course works on the tablets, but it doesn't
      make the best use of the available space.  I think that a re-work
      of the user interface to really take advantage of the size of the
      tablets is what they're looking for.
   2. Move WordPress: This one didn't turn out as great as it could have
      last year.  I didn't mentor that project, so I don't know all the
      details, but we wanted something that could ultimately make moving
      a WP install simple.  Think about people that don't know how to
      use FTP.  Maybe they know their FTP details, maybe they don't. 
      This would probably require that either the functionality be built
      into core or that the plugin be uploaded to both sides.  Remember
      that there are two basic things this should do:
         1. Move a site from one server to another
                * This basically means you need to bring across all the
                  files as well as the database.  Additionally it should
                  check for things like upload path to make sure it's
                  still valid (upload paths are sometimes absolute and
                  this change from server to server), etc.
         2. Move a site from one domain to another
                * This is actually trickier.  The main reason is that
                  the domain name is in a lot of places:
                      o In the settings
                      o In posts, pages, etc in links, image src
                        elements, etc
                      o In menus
                      o In widgets - which is even more difficult
                        because widget settings including widget content
                        is stored in a serialized array, so the data
                        needs to be unserialized, the domain name
                        changed, then the data needs to be re-serialized
                        and stored.
         3. Both (changing servers at the same time as changing domains)
            - Nothing new here, but it should be able to do both
            simultaneously.
   3. New User Walkthrough: I like your idea of making this a "site
      health" thing that could be useful throughout the life of a site. 
      I definitely recommend that you pursue it if only because it's
      something unique that you came up with.  Remember though that
      while this sounds like a simple thing, you need to make it
      extensible.  Other plugins are going to want to hook into it and
      add their own list of things for new users to do and their own
      ongoing site health info.  For example, a forum (like BBPress or
      SimplePress) might want to have a user upload an avatar or put
      unread threads or private messages into the list, etc.

Good luck!  Also, as a quick side note: WordPress has a capital P in the 
middle <http://twitter.com/#%21/sivel/status/49503908674027520>.  Make 
sure you spell it that way in your applications!

The functions themselves aren't inherently broken but the semantic meaning
of 'dynamic sidebar' has been a total misnomer since the moment it was
committed. Not only does 'sidebar' have a VERY SPECIFIC meaning in the world
of web design (not stated in your dictionary definition but likely obvious
to everyone on this list nonetheless) but the word 'dynamic' in this case is
totally useless. Are there non-dynamic 'sidebars' that are handled by the
API somehow? Why not show_* or display_*?

This only needs to be changed once ever in the history of WordPress and then
it can be fine forever, and the change is worth it. There is also a very
good explanation for why this problem came about: WP has become a full CMS
capable of all kinds of layouts and moved away from the 'blog layout' in
which 'sidebar' was an accurate description of where widgets usually went.

Before the widgets API no one thought about modular layouts with tons of
sidebars because users would have no good way to edit them, so it makes
sense that during the *design* of the sidebars API the developers didn't
have the right perspective on how to name them. After the fact it is easy to
see how the mistake was made and also to imagine ways of fixing it so that
new users can understand it easily and with less cognitive dissonance.

FWIW I'm with Nacin in thinking that the renaming should also come with some
new features so that it's not JUST a renaming but also a technical upgrade.
This would help give the change meaning and motivate some people to switch
to the new way just to get the new features.

Here are some ideas for desirable upgrades to the Widget Area system that
would make sense:

   - Argument to make a registered sidebar display wigets in a random order.

   - Argument to set a maximum number of widgets for a given sidebar, after
   which none can be added.
   - Argument to set a minimum number of widgets for a given sidebar, below
   which the sidebar won't be saved.
   - Argument to set default widgets to show in case none have been added
   via the wp-admin UI.

You need to submit a separate application for each idea.
Note: make sure that you don't just copy and paste the whole thing and 
change the title - it looks like spam. Be sure that the parts of the 
application that are project specific are all filled out uniquely for 
each project proposal.

Subject: [wp-hackers] get attachment ID when hijacking Media Library
	send_to_editor
Message-ID: <AANLkTimg-cTfE44Opia-+ykbZX3ALUFV2koeDsXo+_E9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using code from Brad Williams, Ozh Richard and Justin Tadlock's
excellent new book on plugin development (pp. 84 - 89; boj-meta-box in
http://media.wiley.com/product_ancillary/22/04709162/DOWNLOAD/Chapter%2004%20Code.zip).

The idea is to hijack the Media Library interface for choosing images
or files for custom fields (whether in post meta boxes, custom
settings pages, widgets, etc.).

What I'm trying to do is to return the attachment ID instead of the
URL. The standard send_to_editor function is the way the code I'm
building on gets into things - replacing it with another function
which takes the HTML on its way into the editor and grabs the URL from
the image SRC.

Getting the image ID is doable - it's included as part of a class in
the HTML generated. But what about other files? The HTML generated is
just a link, without any indication of the ID. You could take the URL
and maybe match on the guid column in the posts table - but what if
the Link field is empty? Only the file title is returned, and this
isn't necessarily unique.

Has anyone figured out how to get the ID of the selected file more directly?

cheers,

Steve Taylor

You are saying something like this:

$thumbnail_id = get_post_meta( $post->ID, '_thumbnail_id', true );
$img = wp_get_attachment_thumb_url( $thumbnail_id );
echo "<img src=\"$img\">";

or

$thumb = wp_get_attachment_image( $thumbnail_id, 'thumbnail', true );

or

$attachments = get_children( array('post_parent' => $post->ID, 'post_type'
=> 'attachment', 'post_mime_type' => 'image') );
if ($attachments) {
$which = 'attach';
foreach ( $attachments as $attachment_id => $attachment ) {
 $thumb = wp_get_attachment_image( $attachment_id, 'thumbnail', true );
}
}

?

Rafael, thanks for trying but I think I should have been more explicit
in my post.

The issue is about getting the attachment's ID in JavaScript, when the
"Insert into Post" button is clicked in the Media Library thickbox
interface. The send_to_editor function that it's possible to override
only receives the HTML generated ready for placing into TinyMCE (or,
in my case, placing something into a custom field) - and while it's
possible to extract image IDs from the class in the generated HTML, it
doesn't seem to be for files.

The whole language and management of sidebars is mystifying to the non-programmers that I teach how to use WordPress...  I would love to see some improvements in this area.  Semantically, I'm trying to teach people the term "Widget Areas" rather than "Sidebars".

As a "WordPress as a CMS"  user/developer, I'd really like to see some page-specific sidebar functionality getting added to core (stuff like what StudioPress does in SimpleSidebars, plus nice stuff from WidgetLogic).  Specifically:

1) Allow the creation of new, named widget areas from the dashboard (which correspond to "holes" (er... sidebars) in the theme, similar to how menus work).  This would allow users to switch themes without having to re-organize all of their widgets every time they do it.
2) Allow the assignment of specific sidebars/widget areas to individual pages (where the page template supports them)
3) Provide a quick way to navigate and edit the widgets that show up on a page, category page, tag, or author page.  Right now, one of my CMS sites has a stack of 20 "sidebars" listed on the widget page, which gets confusing for users - especially since 18 of them are specific widget areas that are used on 6 unique pages.
4) I also like Jeremy's 4th point, below.   It would help when people are trying to pick out a theme to use and have to spend a lot of time re-adding widgets.

Cheers,

Anca.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Cron Tasks doesn't update_options
Message-ID: <AANLkTik2UNRZM1FwfvrLrNLmmrcBf15vwn4SgFt_Fixg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

It seems like cronned tasks can't update options in my setup.

I've written a basic plugin to illustrate the effect here
https://github.com/craig552uk/cron-plugin/blob/master/main.php
The plugin simply updates a stored option to the current time each
time it is run.
The settings page of the plugin shows the scheduled time for the task
to run (which updates) and the stored time (which does not update).

Am I overlooking something in my configuration?
Are there any special server configs for cron to run correctly?
Or is this a more general problem with cron? (probably not this)

Any help greatly appreciated.

-Craig

You're using wp_schedule_event incorrectly.

wp_schedule_event(time(), 'minute', 'cron_plugin_action');

The third parameter is an *action*, not a callback function name.
Later you have this code:

/* Cron function */
function cron_plugin_action(){
    update_option( 'cron_plugin_time', time() );
}

In order for that to work, you would also need:
add_action('cron_plugin_action', 'cron_plugin_action');

In order to hook the action name to the function name.

Basically, your function is never being run.

I imagine when we decide to get serious about re-thinking links, that'll be
the first stat I'll look for, too.

If anyone's interested, I've got something working. Butt ugly, but it works.

I've made it into a plugin to provide the generic ability to utilize
the Media Library overlay - for other plugins, themes, etc. I'll get
it online when I crack this deadline, but contact me off-list if
you're interested.

cheers,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Assigning and using custom taxonomy with link object
Message-ID: <AANLkTikqk1OjA-_zR7UaQ6RA7AmGwumSx_dBe=kHF4h1@mail.gmail.com>

Aaahh, see, I *knew* it was my breath. Thanks Scribu ;-)

And yes, my desire to avoid reinventing the wheel was just me being lazy
really. I've already gone ahead and created a resource_link custom post type
with associated taxonomies, and am working on the metaboxes as we "speak".

On that note: I am also eagerly awaiting the discussed and potentially
upcoming wp meta box class ( actually contemplating if it would be
counterproductive at this point to implement wpalchemy's meta box class into
my workflow/framework or just keep scrapping along creating boxes on the
fly... so ... any insight on that would be most helpful  .. hint hint )

It would be great to just steal the existing metaboxes from the default link
edit page ... is there a steal_this_metabox() hook forthcoming ... heh ...

I figured that when the links are rewritten to be post types and that links
table disappears into oblivion, I would simply switch my resource_link type
to the new link object and call it a day.

Thanks for dealing with my breath ... and confirming what I didn't want to
accept as the probable reality of imagining I could use the built in links.

You may want to look at the Health Check plugin (or more specifically
what has been talked about for it) as inspiration.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_handle_upload
Message-ID: <AANLkTin1JQNM3f-y1W4WyW2GT93+y4-ZmRmvjAGroLmt@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a form that generates new file inputs on a user click. The form is
huge but in essence all that is relevant is this-

<form>
   <input type="file" name="image[]">
   <input type="file" name="image[]">
   <input type="file" name="image[]">
   <input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit">
</form>

When the form is posted i would like to use wp_handle_upload.
I successfully use this when there are single files being uploaded but
cannot get it to work for an array.

Currently i have this-
                                        $overrides = array('test_form' =>
false);
foreach($_FILES['image'][name] as $key => $value){
$file = wp_handle_upload($_FILES['image'], $overrides);
echo "<pre>"; print_r($file); echo "</pre>";
}

I know that is wrong but i cant figure out how to pass in each file in the
$_FILES array as the structure of the array is
Array

(
    [albumimage] => Array
        (
            [name] => Array
                (
                    [0] =>
                    [1] => cameron.jpg
                    [2] => clegg.jpg
                )

            [type] => Array
                (
                    [0] =>
                    [1] => image/jpeg
                    [2] => image/jpeg
                )

            [tmp_name] => Array
                (
                    [0] =>
                    [1] => /tmp/phpClmUp1
                    [2] => /tmp/php7p3TJO
                )

            [error] => Array
                (
                    [0] => 4
                    [1] => 0
                    [2] => 0
                )

            [size] => Array
                (
                    [0] => 0
                    [1] => 16165
                    [2] => 19181
                )

        )

)


I have looked at the wp_handle_upload function in wp-admin/includes/file.php
and can see where the function moves the file -

rename( $file['tmp_name'], $new_file )

But i need it to handle it like this-

foreach($file['tmp_name'] as $fileSingle){
rename( $file['tmp_name'][$i], $new_file )
}

or similar..... you can see what i mean....

Has anyone had experience with this? I would prefer to use wp_handle_upload
but am thinking i may have to resort to doing it manually...

If this is not possible is it something that needs a patch?

Any help massively appreciated!

Thank you!

Andy

Hello hackers,
With the introduction of post-formats, its becoming easier and a complete
option to implement social integration on a WordPress install. Some plugins
are already out there but nothing to provide a complete solution. StatusNet
and diaspora protocols are also a good option if you think of converting a
WP install into a complete social ID.
What do you think?

Integrating WordPress with a social network like Facebook or some version of
Diaspora is interesting ... but more because we'd all like to see how it
could be done and how it could be done *well*.

Are you thinking along the lines of pulling in content from an external
source, pushing content out to an external source, hosting a Diaspora-based
system within WordPress or BuddyPress?

How would you convert a WordPress site into "a complete social ID?"  What
exactly does that mean, what would it look like, and who would the end user
be?

This basically means we can turn a WordPress single user blog (with 1
author) into his own profile.
All profiles and groups are distributed across the web on multiple servers
with each individual / group owning its own data.

I would say Facebook can be a project on its own and Ostatus can be kept
separate as a more complex and more interesting project.
There are basically two types of end users for facebook integration

   1. WordPress end users and Business blogs.
   People with pages basically.
   A friend of mine, Ankit Agarwal, started hacking on  a plugin for
   integrating WordPress and Facebook comments. I joined in with the last
   release of the plugin.
   Currently this is what the plugin can do
   - Push a link to wall/feed of the user when a new post is made on
      WordPress (Probably adding as a note would be better in case of
blog posts
      atleast)
      - Track all comments on that shared link on Facebook, pull them back
      to WordPress
      - Push comments to Facebook which are made on WordPress.
   It would have been easier if we had posting on facebook comments with
   openID from WordPress installation. (Like you can post facebook comments
   using Yahoo)

   Plans with the Facebook-Merge plugin.
   - Provide almost all social plugins from facebook, customizable as
      individual child plugins. (Connect, Comments, Like etc...)
      - Let users post and pull from a page or profile with all formats.
      Status updates, Videos, Images (Photos), Links, Standard post
excerpt as a
      link description etc.
      - Probably add analytics (la ThinkUp) and let users access insights.
      2. A Social network on BuddyPress
   I dont think this one needs much explaining. Hit facebook connect button
   and use both sites like one . (Am not sure of the legal stuff here)


The Second project is making single user sites/profiles compliant with
OStatus and Activity streams
Social ID is a term I came up with to make it easy for myself. I think its
officially called Ostatus.
This basically means we can turn a WordPress single user blog (with 1
author) Objects fly across the web to make your data completely yours.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Why functions.php is not UTF-8?
Message-ID: <AANLkTimAecR=58-YM8Gr80fk_Kp2sj0Ru7SicK3Z4z1i@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

While working on a new child theme for Twentyten I started to
experience a lot of anoying problems with chars sent early to the
browser. After a lot of debuging I realize that my functions.php was
in UTF-8 and Twentyten's version was in ANSI encoding.

It's confusing, because WordPress use AND RECOMENDS UTF-8 for its content.

My question is, why functions.php is not UTF-8?

Now I converted my own functions file to ANSI and everything works just fine.

Wierd!!!

No. Text is text. The functions.php file in twentyten should contain
nothing that would be different between ANSI or UTF-8. There is no
"encoding" when all the characters in the file are below char code
128. The first octet of UTF-8 is the same as ISO Latin 1 and ASCII.

Now, if you were specifically saving as UTF-8, then your text editor
may have been adding what's known as a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to the
beginning of the file. PHP does not understand the BOM and will treat
it as printable text. Therefore, you need to configure your text
editor to not save a BOM to *.php files. You can save it as UTF-8,
just not with a BOM.

More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark

Message-ID: <AANLkTinrzsAOXym+XRDJmWd+UTO6pMbxCxJ7CFX0KX3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have my Post Page set in options to 'site.com/news'. When I register
a custom post type I use "rewrite' => array( 'slug' =>
'books','use_front' => false)" - as I want the urls to be
site.com/books. When I do this, it doesn't work - though
site.com/books/test redirects me to site.com/news/books/test.

Any clue to what is happening here?

Is there something I need to flush?

Thanks a lot.

All the best,

Alex

Hi everyone,

I'm in the process of developing a new theme and I was wondering what 
testing tools (if any) you guys use for examining performance? I've 
installed the BlackBox plugin, and I'm also using WebGrind and XDebug.

I'm not sure how useful these results are in the real world, however, as 
they are all about PHP execution and obviously don't take into account 
all of the other aspects of loading a web page. I've used YSlow to try 
and get a better measure of this side of things, but I was wondering how 
(if?) you track the efficiency of the WP core and if you had any advice 
on the best ways of measuring performance.

Thanks,

I use xhprof or webgrind and xdebug. And then YSlow or Google Page
Speed for other performance aspects as you say.

While there are some issues with the implementation, as Aaron linked, your
issue is probably use_front versus with_front.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimCoo=7Aw2Hx1GwiPF-zgf-94tvKtObZpdLO1id@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Hackers,

I plan to take up this project to allow easy domain as well as hosting
shifting WP installations along with all posts & settings. We need to
extract all information from the database, template, plugins, etc.

This would also allow the user to move the WP to a different directory on
the same domain.. ex: www.mydomain.com to www.mydomain.com/blog

I think, we can cover up this project well before the GSoC's deadline so we
can club the other project which involves integrating "Progress Bars" with
the WP. This can be added across all admin sections as well as users' pages
where they need to wait for some processing to be over. We can definitely
use some existing open source solution and integrate with our WP.

Please pool in your suggestions/ comments.

Hey,

While checking in the archive, I found that a similar or same version
already exists as a plugin. I thought since its given on the idea page, must
have not been implemented yet.

Please let me know if I'm wrong somewhere!

Check these

   1. Plugin by Azizur
   https://github.com/azizur/wordpress-oneclick-migration and also
   2.
   http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/119/easily-move-a-wordpress-install-from-development-to-production/182#182
   3. http://erisds.co.uk/projects/migrate
   4. http://spectacu.la/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/

I was planning to apply for this but these plugins summed up do a lot of
things that is needed. No doubt much is left but "will that last a full
term?" is the question I have in mind

May be we can make ONE plugin summing up all this & adding crystal clear
plugin for users for easy shifting.
Combined with one more project as I suggested in my first mail?

Actually, as Nacin pointed out, your problem is probably that you seem 
to be using "use_front" when it should be "with_front":
'rewrite' => array( 'slug' => 'books', 'with_front' => false ) )

Subject: [wp-hackers] Loading JS & CSS from inside a plugin
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=-5qob_ek7r14v4_xiu+sH=_6Vp+oqPNp8Vyx=@mail.gmail.com>

I'm the author of the Dave's WordPress Live Search plugin, and getting very
frustrated trying to load Javascript and CSS within my plugin.

I've spent way too many hours dealing with all the different configurations
& plugins my users are using, including (but probably not limited to):

* Normal WordPress in Docroot
* Normal WordPress in a subdirectory
* WP Subdomains plugin
* wp-content in a non-standard location
* WPMU

Way back in my plugin's v1.0 days, I included the relevant JS & CSS in the
page's <head>. But that upset a lot of devs who didn't want the same code
included in every page. It's redundant, but at least I could be guaranteed
it would work.

As of the current dev version, I'm hooking into parse_request and returning
the static resource if a query parameter exists.

Here's how I'm loading one of the scripts:

define('DWLS_JS_PARAM', 'dwls_js');
wp_enqueue_script('jquery_dimensions', get_bloginfo('url') . "?" .
DWLS_JS_PARAM . '=dimensions', 'jquery');

It's slower than linking to a static file (WordPress has to start running),
but it works universally -- or so I thought. Today, I got two bug reports
for issues loading resources on WPMU, one of which is using the dev version:
http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-daves-wordpress-live-search-broken-with-domain-mapping-wpmu

My question in the short term is "what am I doing wrong?". Is there a better
way I can link to a resource and be guaranteed it'll work across the board?

For the long term I'd like to request the addition of a new API, similar to
Drupal's "Butler" project, which figures out a context from the site config
and current page request, and can generate correct links to pages & files.
Plugins like WP Subdomains can hook into this API and change the rules it
uses to build URLs. I haven't thought out the details yet, but WP could
really use it.

Any help would be appreciated. I'm spending too much time tracking down
little compatibility issues and it's keeping me from making further
improvements to this plugin or even tackling other WordPress projects.

Thanks,
Dave

Yikes. That's annoying.

Better way:

1. Make your JS file static. Like a file named code.js. Put it in the
same dir as the plugin.

2. wp_enqueue_script('code', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__).'code.js', 'jquery');

And to answer your users who will inevitably demand the ability to keep that
js from running on some pages, as of WP 3.1 you can have them include this
before wp_head():

wp_dequeue_script('code');

Works like a champ :-)

can a Custom Post Type w/ hierarchical => true

(ie, not talking about single-{cpt-slug}.php,
but any Custom Template w/ "Template Name: Foo" at top.)

this ticket, and trying the code itself, say no:
"Template" shouldn't show for custom hierarchical post types
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12759

there's an Attibutes box, but only w/ Parent & Menu Order;
NO Template select menu to be found.

yet the Codex is convinced it can be done:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/ 
register_post_type#Arguments

under "supports", it reads: "'page-attributes' (template and menu order,
hierarchical must be true to show Parent option)"

is this a 3.2 thang, as the (closed) ticket implies?

CPT's do not support Page Templates.
I've updated the codex to reflect that.
Previous to 3.0 the Template option was displayed, however it did not save
(And therefor, not apply on the front end).

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Idea
Message-ID: <1300844977.11911.29.camel@rivalry>

Hey,
I was reading latest conversations about possible ideas for this GSoC,
and thought I could ask about a project I would like to have in
WordPress plugins repo.

Coming from last year idea about moving WordPress, I would love to have
a tool like VaultPress [1]. Basically to have this done, you will have
to steal, err... learn, from VaultPress project possible features, look
and feel. :)

I would love to see a tool that:
* exports all the data, settings, theme and plugins
* uses some versioning backend (say git or other scm, I think I don't
have to explain what would be the benefits of using this kind of
approach)
* does everything on it's own (so I won't care if the data is synced or
not)
* restores all the data with one click
* has triggers to send me reports if core files changed (like in case of
security holes from hosting providers) or other things of this kind

In some words an OpenSource VaultPress that I will be able to set
(absolutely freely) on my blog, connect it with my other server in the
other galaxy, and don't care about `Aliens` :)

A success story of this kind might be SparkleShare, an OpenSource
replacement for DropBox[2].

Currently there are a couple of this kind of plugins that backup data to
Amazon/Rackspace/DropBox/Ftp, but all those hardly cover, at least, my
1st requirement.

Feedback welcome.

"Butler" is something the Drupal core team is sketching out for Drupal 8.
So, details are pretty thin.

They're trying to consolidate core APIs, modernize the blocks system (their
equivalent of WP's widgets), replace the current plugin system, and
integrate functionality from popular plugins into core. Like a real-life
butler may coordinate the work of the cooks, maids, and other staff in a
home, the Drupal Butler will decide what functionality is invoked and when.

To do this, the Butler needs to be the central source of information on
configuration and context. Configuration is straightforward -- Butler acts
as a repository for config data, like the Windows registry but not broken.
Context is more interesting. Based on the URL, user agent, connection speed,
time of day, lunar cycle, and what the President of the USA had for
breakfast, Butler will figure out the appropriate content, plugins, and
theme it needs to render the output. Notice I said "output" and not "page",
because the Drupal 8 team intends to decouple HTML generation from the rest
of the system. The only thing that should output HTML is the theme, and only
if Butler decides an HTML-generating theme is appropriate.

Drupal 6's architecture was very loosely-coupled. While this is great for
code maintenance, it's led to some inefficiencies. For example, my
understanding is that every block in the system is rendered every time a
page loads, and the theme causes the correct ones to actually be output when
it calls the code to render a block region ("sidebar"). This keeps the
blocks and theme separate, sure, but then they have to use caching at
multiple levels in the system (such as the "block cache") to keep
performance manageable.

Back to WordPress. Before I went the parse_request route for loading
scripts, I was checking for a WP_SUBDOMAINS symbol and trying to make a the
right URL for that case, then doing something different if wp-content was
moved, and so forth. Otto, thanks for the heads-up on plugin_dir_url(). That
might be exactly what I'm looking for, or I see it calls plugins_url() which
is actually documented in the Codex and I somehow missed up 'til now.

When I ask for a WordPress equivalent to Butler, I'm not saying we should
steal their idea outright, but I can definitely see an advantage to
centralizing & standardizing how common plugin tasks are handled. I don't
want to have to think about all the different configurations and plugin
combinations out there. Have my plugin call a method to get the absolute URL
for a file in the plugin's dir at the current site URL (like plugin_dir_url
I guess). If something fails, let it be because WP Subdomains or WPMU didn't
implement Butler's version of the plugins_url filter, not because I didn't
create a special case. It could also standardize the options API, like
they're doing in Drupal, so it's less of a crapshoot whether a plugin uses
separate entries for each setting or one big serialized array. Widget Logic
would be a good candidate for inclusion in a WordPress "Butler", too, so
widgets can be included on a page based on "context".

Thats something :)
About backing up WP, the user will need to have another server which stores
the data.
(We can do it for the same server also but in that case alien attacks,
server crashes, exploits which wipe out data (Like the one I had :( ) and
natural disasters in server location wont save the user)
and almost defeat the purpose of the plugin.
Not many people have a server and php installed and configured on local so
either we give them a readymade installer and clear instructions to set one
up at home or we make them buy another hosting package (cloud / VCS host /
otherwise)
I am totally in for the versioning system and probably push to a private
repo on github or the like in other VCS. but the problem there is not all
hosts have any version control system installed, let alone a specific one.

A really cool project would be making one with the Diff class and md5 hash
:) (Template versioning extended?)
But for keeping WP backed up and up to date with its backups, we'll need
objects and files flying to the backup server. (daily / hourly cron??)

Another option to consider here is use of (html5) localstorage? ( If I
remember correctly we had some firefox extension for offline access right?)

I just looked into this in more detail, and I'm not convinced this will
work. It's probably the proper way to do it, but I don't feel it's the right
way.

WP Subdomains is the bane of my existence. It doesn't redefine WP_PLUGIN_URL
(how could it?) and it doesn't implement the plugins_url filter. I don't
think plugin_dir_url() will know what to do with it. To make matters worse,
the WP Subdomains plugin hasn't been updated since 12/30/2009, so chances
are nobody will be updating it to do so anytime soon. But, I know from
experience that if I break compatibility with it, if I generate a script tag
that references a Javascript file on the main domain and not whatever
subdomain the user is visiting, I will wake up to an inbox full of
complaints. Nasty ones.

As much as I'd like to write back to each & every one of those people and
say "screw it, the plugin sucks and I don't care", that's not my way and I
don't think it's the WordPress way.

So how do other plugin authors deal with it?

Sounds like exactly what I would do. If some other plugin is not
compatible and is doing-it-wrong, then that's not my problem.

plugin_dir_url() is the correct way to get the URL to a plugin
directory. If some other plugin doesn't handle it correctly, then
that's the other plugin's problem. Fix it, fork it, or forget it.

I didn't deny that I would need an external machine, but as I already
mentioned, that one doesn't have to be from Amazon/Rackspace/Dropbox
with their proprietary software on it.

Believe me, a lot have. And If I want, I can setup a machine for me and
my friends, that still will be cheaper/free for them compared to
existing solutions available now.

The versioning system I mentioned is git, because it's very easy to
setup one, and git's protocol and features are rock solid. Plus it has
wrappers in a lot of popular languages.

Also you missed the whole point of this thread, it's not about the
server, versioning, and how you will do things, it's about one click
backup, automated *delta* increment backup (you backup only what
changed, so you can see what changed easily), and one click restore.

> :) (Template versioning extended?)

Your approach means you will have to write a whole layer for
transporting the resulted diff with it's hashes (which means we go one
step back and need to write more code, not cool!). Plus md5 hashes as a
way of checking files is far from being the best compared to let's say
sha1 used in a git/hg revision system. Plus md5 will kill your server if
you will have to check a poll of several big files and it will require
you to write a queueing system and so on... just KISS.

No we don't. Last used technology, was Google Gears, which was removed
long time ago. Plus, I'm talking about some rock solid backup solution,
not a temporary one. html5 storage is only good for client side
caching/temporary data storage.

BTW, I tend to use plugins_dir_url(__FILE__).'file.js' because it's easy to
remember for me. However, a similar call of plugins_url('file.js',
__FILE__) works equally well and uses that function more the way it
was intended to be used. Either is good.

There's actually a ton of functions like this. Check through the
link-template.php file. Generally speaking, you don't have to roll
your own unless you're doing something exceedingly weird.

The "right" way depends on context. I generally recommend a serialized
array because most plugins tend to need all their options at once
anyway. It's not like you need only half the options on any given page
load. However, if your case does need something like that, it's
doable.

As for standardizing the options API, we have that. It's called the
Settings API:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API
http://ottopress.com/2009/wordpress-settings-api-tutorial/

This has been discussed off and on for a long time. Nobody can agree
on the User Interface. Widget Logic's interface is, well, awful. Other
similar interfaces that add options to widgets to select where they
appear and such using checkboxes are equally bad. They're all very
nerd-oriented, basically. Until there's a simpler and more obvious way
invented, I expect this to remain in the realm of plugins.

What I was missing is that they'd probably also not care if a backup exists.
They'll probably be happy with the backup their hosting manager makes every
few days.

Even if they dont have one, thats one step they'll want to have added.
write, configure etc everything offline on localhost, click merge and you
are done

hmm
yeah WP SuperCache does it so probably we can too!

browsers will slowly move towards allowing good access on localstorage with
html5 n js picking up a lot but thats too far off for now and truly a
"temporary" one.

Moreover if we have the 1 click merge/ 1 click backup configurable to
localhost also, localstorage will be of no use anyway.
Though am not sure if it can be localhost because then you cannot send to
the localhost all the time for backups. it may be shutdown, not connected,
no fixed ip etc etc. we can surely wait for localhost to ask for data via a
cron and implement it that way.

Group of friends buying a common server or something seems a much viable
option at the moment.

Opps - my mistake - now however I am getting 404 errors. Any idea how
I can rectify this - the adding page is now correct, and sends me out

Thanks again.

this on my admin bar or similar? If not then I'll write it as it would
be very useful indeed!

Hello,

As WordPress moves more and more into CMS territory, the "main" missing
feature, as far as I can see, when compared to Drupal/Joomla, is the ability
to assign "callouts/nodes/widgets" (whatever you like to call them), to
particular pages.

A system, a bit like WP menus, for widgets, would be a clincher for
WordPress as a CMS.

I understand there are plugins that achieve this effect already, however, my
question is ...

Is there a drive to improve Widgets handling in Core? Any tickets I can
read? Any info anyone can give?

Rob

Hi Robert,

Before we can even think of adding widgets per page etc., there's a lot of
cleaning necessary in the current code, first.

We have a nice WP_Widget class, but it still uses the old callbacks. It's a
mess, in general.

Don't know if there's a ticket for it already, but if you're willing to help
with that, it would be awesome.

Shelly, try explicitly defining your own sidebar IDs.

For example:

register_sidebar( array(
     'id'            => 'home_left',
     'name'          => 'Home Left',
     'description'   => 'This is the top left section of the homepage.',
) );

or:

$home_right_widget_area_id = register_sidebar( array(
     'id'            => 'home_right',
     'name'          => 'Home Right',
     'description'   => 'This is the top right section of the homepage.',
) );

As mentioned above:

*As much as I'd love to entertain this conversation, purely as people who
do this are the bane of my life, this is now very off-topic.

End of conversation please.  :)*

I second this sentiment.

As an update for those who find this via Google and are also looking on how
to work with redirects and getting information on where you were redirected
to:

1)
http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-favicons/trunk/includes/class-http.php
basically
works incl. in-page javascript redirects and http meta redirects (manual
redirect so redirect=0) - whatever you throw it will return a favicon IF it
exists. but.............

2) there is one open issue:
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16855#comment:29  (for Curl
FOLLOWLOCATION
must be set to false) (and other like wise new parameter) --> in my testset
: 500 out of 1500 URLS get me the message "Too many redirects"
................ (!) (I dont think anyone ever used redirect=0)

3) but since the only reason why one would want to set redirect to 0 =
knowing where we are heading to first ( at least that is what I think and
since there is the missing feature in #2 apparently noone could have used it
anyway in any succes):  https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16950 which
would work independent of (2) makes the code of (1) for a great part not
necessary and simply requests that URL that is forwarded to with redirects
as normal.

one addition: Im thinking to drop the HEAD requests first as suggested
earlier. Too many cases where we have first a 200 then a 301/302 or a 405
method not allowed (the HEAD) etc... and only do gets. I have to run that
through some more tests.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Is there an image post-upload hook for post-processing
	images?
Message-ID: <4D8A38EF.2090900@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm probably overlooking something, but I can't find a hook which will 
be called after uploading an image. I would like to process uploaded 
images further. In my particular case I would like to process one type 
of featured image further by pixelizing it and blending the colors.

Any help much appreciated!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Installing themes, plugins without FTP credentials
Message-ID: <6FDE923B-FF64-4D08-A3A5-10578C609F31@birdhouse.org>

From all the reading I've done, WP's themes and plugins installers will either:

1) Work without FTP credentials if the directories are writable by the web server process
or
2) Prompt for FTP credentials

On my server, apache runs as nobody. So:

chown -R nobody:nobody wp-content/themes
chmod g+w wp-content/themes

Still prompts for FTP credentials. For testing, I open it up all the way (which I don't like to do):

drwxrwxrwx   6 nobody  nobody 4096 Mar 21 12:00 themes/

but it still doesn't work. Making sure the installer scripts themselves are owned by nobody:

# ls -l wp-admin/theme-install.php 
-rw-r--r--  1 nobody nobody 3355 Feb 25 13:27 wp-admin/theme-install.php

So... why do I still get prompted for FTP credentials? Using WP 3.1.

Thanks,
Scot

I use the 'wp_generate_attachment_metadata' filter.

Its because the Filesystem class, checks to see if it can write to WordPress root, not the folder its about to write stuff too :-(

A less efficient way of achieving the same effect is to install suPHP on the server. I did that at one point with an older machine if you'd like me to dig up instructions

suPHP or other setuid methods shouldn't really be used except on
shared servers, where multiple users are sharing a single hosting
system.

If you have a private server, you can simply change the owner of the
WordPress directory and files to the user apache runs as and the
direct method will work, although this is really less secure.
Realistically, you should live with putting in your FTP credentials.

If you're wanting to automate this, you can define FTP_HOST, FTP_USER,
and FTP_PASS in the wp-config file to automatically use those. I would
recommend that if you do this, you setup an FTP user specifically for
this case who only has access to the WP directory.

It has nothing to do with how you register the post type. It has to do
with how you create the posts.

Attachment posts work in the same way. The attachment post has a
post_type of "attachment" and the post_parent is set to the post where
the attachment was uploaded (which has a post type of "post" or
"page").

When you do wp_insert_post to insert your custom post, you just set
the post_parent to the ID of the parent post item. Post type is
irrelevant to that.

Scot, it looks like you're already well versed on solving this but just as note from my own experiences I couldn't install plugins/themes on a server for the longest time without FTP credentials. It turned out that the WordPress install on the server was not the same user as the server, despite every indication to the contrary in Linux.

I ran <?php echo exec('whoami'); ?> in the functions.php file of my site and it returned a different user than appeared as the owner from a command line. I simply changed ownership of the directory to match what WP thought it was and the problems went away.

What I suspect is that during an update from the browser, either the core or a plugin altered the ownership settings while unarchiving. But, on 100's of servers I've only encountered it on a Nginx and have been unable to reproduce the result consistently so it could just as easily have been a freak anonymity related to the server build.

Hello,

I am Abhishek Gupta second year undergraduate student at IIT Delhi <
http://abhishekgupta92.info >. I want to work on Education module which
enhances features to the wordpress like adding/enrolling courses, students.
There is a module namely teachpress <
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/teachpress/> which is aimed at same but
the module is not developed enough to be used when there are cms like moodle
available.

My motive for this is to promote community blogging in School/Institutions.
I have a community blog at the thelazy.info and feels the absence of such
module for my institution.

Other topic that interest me is CCK and Views module which can compete with
Drupal modules for the same. Currently there is a cck module in wordpress,
but the module is not really easy to use. In addition to this the user need
views module to generate flexible views of what he want to display.

Thanks for responses everyone. Though the suggestion above did not work, this does: In wp-config, add:

define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');

and make sure wp-content/themes and wp-content/plugins are writable by the web server. You do NOT need to change ownership of the document root, and these less permissive perms work fine for plugins and themes:

drwxrwxr-x   9 username nobody 4096 Mar 23 15:14 themes/
drwxrwxr-x   9 username nobody 4096 Mar 23 15:14 themes/

Before finding this, I tried adding FTP info to wp-config, but found it very slow, and it would be tedious to get FTP working for 100+ different users. This "direct" method is definitely the simplest solution.

It also gets the perms right so that  themes and plugins can be  edited and/or deleted from the Dashboard.

Thanks,
Scot

Be very, very careful with forcing the method. Test it with a complete
WP upgrade as well. Having the wrong method could just have it go
right ahead and break your site for no obvious reason.

Hello there,

One of the WPFR members just made me notice that the "class" selector
(from TinyMCE's Insert/Edit Link window) has vasnished.
I can't seem to find the trac ticket with the rationale, nor a widget
with way to have that option back.

Could someone help me (and this guy) out?

Thanks a lot.

Xavier, the TinyMCE was updated in the latest version of WordPress. Have you tried using the http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tinymce-advanced/ plugin to modify it's defaults and restore the line items you're looking for?

Hi Abhishek,
good to know there are people interested in bringing new tools into
learning environments/systems.

Since last year I'm part of ScholarPress team, into which I got involved
by proposing and building up a LMS using BuddyPress (it still lacks some
features, but we're on the right way). This was a gsoc project, and I
will try to propose it again this year.

ScholarPress is a team of teachers and WordPress developers that
originally started the Courseware project (my project is a direct
continuation of it). [1]

To be honest, It's news to me to hear about TeachPress, and before you
apply I encourage you to consider both Courseware projects ScholarPress
maintains, though this year idea is to merge them and complete with new
features. The only reason why I suggest you to do this, is because
Courseware looks richer in features so far and basically covers
TeachPress with it's Course/Bibliography modules.

Also If you care, I would love to get some feedback about ScholarPress
tools from a student point of view.

Good luck.

and do NOT use it on a shared host. Whilst you can, WordPress is generally
choosing FTP in those cases to provide the user security of their files, not
to make life difficult.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom post_type archives and wp_rewrite
Message-ID: <AANLkTimRx7Rx-te1yxV=N14qxX7MB79Zxt8t7-eZdmnN@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have tested the "has_archive" argument to register_post_type and I am not
totally satisfied of the result for a couple of reasons:
- custom post type archive can't be added to a nav menu
- custom post type archive title can't be customized easily

So I went an other way.

Building a plugin for books, in the plugin settings page I allow users to
select what I call a "holding page", a page that holds the custom post type.
Then I use that page's slug for the value of the rewrite parameter of the
custom post type and I had a filter to the_content witch makes a custom
wp_query and calls a custom template to render the custom post type archive,
and I add the result to the holding page's content.

That works pretty well in fact: /subpage/books shows me the books archives
and /subpage/books/my_nice_book shows me the book I need.

But I face a couple issues. Because I use the same rewrite slug as the
page's slug, I have lost the books feed (with anyway points to the books
comments feed page) and I also lost the pagination (books/page/2).

So I thought about adding myself the proper rewrite rules for feeds and
pagination at the top of the other rules, but it fails. To check my rewrite
rules I add a filter:

add_filter('generate_rewrite_rules', array($this, 'generate_rewrite_rules')
);
function generate_rewrite_rules($wp_rewrite) {
    var_export($wp_rewrite->rules);
}

And I properly get at the top of that array:

array (

'books/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$' =>
'index.php?post_type=books&feed=$matches[1]',
'books/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$' =>
'index.php?post_type=books&feed=$matches[1]',

But if I go to mysite.com/books/feed, I get a 404 error... (I flushed the
rules)

Any thought, anyone?

That post_parent use rocks.

I personnaly use to use a custom metabox: when creating a new 'release' a
custom metabox field allows to choose an artist (using a select box or an
autocomplete text field) and I store the artist ID as a post meta.

Dear all,

Got it now I think. Will try and blog it when I'm done to share the knowledge.

I am re-writing a plugin for managing a Creative Commons record label
I wrote ages ago with all my own custom SQL database records, and even
my own customised tags, title filters, RSS feeds, custom template
loader and post style loops and so on. Reviewing the code now, it is
incredible the lengths I went to in order to get things to work - it
feels weird when so much time went into it, but I am literally
blanking whole files to start from scratch. The plugin currently has
4,064 lines of code - I wonder how many it will have when I am done. I
am guess maybe a quarter of this.

Anyone interested in helping out to make the transition easy, then
great! Drop me an e-mail.

Wordpress is so impressive because you get so much "for free" when you
use the Custom Post API.

All the best,

Alex

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin developer "toolbox"
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=UMxzQNWr6XoAB5A4sLuaJNorx2y66dV-KHF_m@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just started on a new plugin called WP IDE which will provide
option for creating plugins within WordPress using a
syntax-highlighted editor, and other features associated with desktop
IDEs. The IDE will contain a form to generate the basic code for a
general-purpose plugin, including creating classes with custom
database tables and all the CRUD code, empty admin screens etc. As
part of that development I'm creating a "toolbox" of classes that will
help me to create plugins more easily. So far I've started work on:

1) A FormBuilder class: allows you to create forms with fieldsets and
form elements, then generate the HTML for those. This class will also
handle HTML5 form elements, and will warn about non-standard
attributes. [1]

2) A Pagination class: allows you to paginate items

3) A DataTable class: allows you to create tables of data easily [2]

4) A PluginOptions class: allows you to save options for a plugin
easily, enforcing rules about the data saved

I have a few questions. Firstly is there anything like this already
available. Secondly, while I'll no doubt think of other "tools" that
will make my plugin development easier in the future, what could you
add to this list? Thirdly, do any of you have other methods, code
libraries etc to help you stop writing boilerplate code?

WordPress provides a lot of functions to make a lot of writing a
plugin easier (user management, database access etc) but a set of
classes like this may be useful to many of us.

regards,

Chris

[1] Some example code:

$form = new FormBuilder("myform");
$fieldset1 = new FormGroup("fieldset1", "cssclass1");
$username = new FormItem("text", "username", "Enter your username");
$fieldset1->addItem($username);
$fieldset2 = new FormGroup("fieldset2", "cssclass2");
$password = new FormItem("password", "password", "Enter your password");
$fieldset2->addItem($password);
$form->addGroup($fieldset1);
$form->addGroup($fieldset2);
$form->paged = true;
echo $form->getHTML();

Hi! There's a typo in your code:
*'post_type'=> 'produtcs'*
should be 'products'.

Chris, just FYI, you might take a look at PodsCMS. It's a framework that
does a lot of this already. http://www.podscms.org/

And the WPDB handles most table interaction fairly well. Though I don't
believe there's a method for creating / dumping tables.

Also, I think Scribu has a set of tools but I haven't used it.

I don't know of  any as sophisticated as what you are proposing.  My 
suggestion for #2 is actually in conflict with #3. I'd like to have some 
more boilerplates to chose from, in that it would be great to have a 
wizard that says, this plugin needs an options page, it modifies posts, 
or is a widget that needs options or any of a number of standard plugin 
actions and then have it create the basic code structure for you to 
build on and modify the properties of in the IDE.

I'd love to see it once you get some basic functionality in...

I don't know of any particular "live" sites to use as an example, but you
could always grab the latest Theme Unit Test data, and install it on a demo
site, using a Theme that supports Post Formats.

StudioPress published a great theme recently that uses Post Formats pretty
well -> Tapestry (
http://www.studiopress.com/releases/tapestry-theme-released.htm)

Here's a site that's using a customized version of Tapestry in action:

Serious question: Why on earth would anyone want to write plugins inside
WordPress? Or even in a browser for that matter?

WordPress is a publishing platform, why try to make it into an IDE? It
doesn't make a lot of sense.

Now, writing an add-on to one or more of the common (PHP) IDE's that
specifically provided WordPress boilerplate plugin projects (and maybe for
widgets and themes), and that perhaps knew enough of WordPress' inner
workings to run your code in a controlled, debuggable WordPress environment,
and especially knew about all the various APIs and hooks and filters and
data structures so it could be a real aid to developing plugins quickly.

Now that might be a good idea.

I'm using it on our travel site: http://www.neverendingvoyage.com. All 
posts marked with the Video post format go to a 'theatre' instead of the 
regular Single post page.

Compare this 
http://www.neverendingvoyage.com/the-secret-life-of-a-nomadic-web-designer/ 
to any other post on the site and you'll see the different layouts.

Not sure if this is what was originally intended for this particular 
functionality, though!

I'm using them on http://www.studionashvegas.com/blog/ . Also my main loops are modified so only the "standard" post loops count toward the "posts per page" limit - there are always 10 standard posts but there can be any number of the other format types scattered in.

Is there a easy (or, at least, straight-forward) way to filter this field
back in? I was attempting to help someone in the WPORG support forums who
had the same question regarding its disappearance. I found the wpdevel
comment noting that the decision was made to remove the link class field,
but couldn't find anything simple/straight-forward to recommend to
re-introduce it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_themes(); in WordPress 3.0.5?
Message-ID: <C9B10CC0.1A889%eckman.john@gmail.com>

Background:
Recent releases of wpbook, my plugin in the repo, have been crashing apache
on WordPress 3.0.5 sites. (And perhaps other versions, but notably not 3.1
sites). 

Investigated it a bit, found that a simple call to get_themes(); (at least
in the context of the wpbook plugin) is enough to cause the crash.

Question:

Is this a known issue?

I saw some trac tickets relating to get_themes() but nothing that seemed
obviously related.

get_themes() is a heavy call on sites that have a lot of themes, since
it goes and reads every theme's info.

However, I can't see it "crashing Apache". At most, you'd get an out
of memory error.

Ok so I've decided I should look into a PHP IDE.  I've been using notepad++
but I think I need a full fledged IDE.  I'm interested to hear any
recommendations from you.  Free is always good but if the feature set is
good and the price is right, say $100 or less, I'd consider it.  So what
would you recommend?

I'm working on a support ticket plugin and I'm looking for users to test and
provide feedback on it.  Will bribe anyone who helps with a generous
discount on the final product.  Email me off-list if interested.

I use Netbeans (free). I'm happy with it. I've also heard good things about
PHPStorm (not free).

Actually, you can apply for a free PHPStorm license if you do open source
development.  I've heard good things about it and think I'll give it a try.

I use Notepad++ for most everything.  Occasionally I'll pull out
Dreamweaver, too, but it's getting a bit old.

This page: http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/buy/buy.jsp#opensource_ makes
it sound as though anyone who offers any paid services related to the open

I use EditPlus on the PC, and Dreamweaver on the Mac. The overhead for DW is pretty high but I like the built in FTP, BBEdit is meant to be fantastic but it's been around 10 years since I used it.

I'm a huge fan of PhpStorm after evaluating NetBeans and other options on the Mac (also works on Windows and Linux.)  I've been a bit active reporting issues[1], but they've taken care of most everything that really needed fixing, and the integration with Zend Debugger rocks. Plus, it's $1 less than your price ceiling for a personal license, or free for O/S development[2]. :)

I've used notepad++ for web dev the past year and so far so good. I've been
doing some C++ work recently though and it's not cutting it, since it doesnt
have a compiler plugin.

But for Web Dev it rocks.

The command line serves me well.  It has my svn client and vim easily
available.  I can use screen if I need a variety of views available
and I never need to take my hands off the keyboard since everything is
designed around the keyboard.

Wow command line?  idk what I would do without my syantax highlighting.  I
like notepad++ but I make too many typos and I need something with built in
debugging to catch it, i forget semicolons like crazy I even had one if
ststement recently that had only one = instead of ==, took some digging to
find out why the function was always returning false, lol.  So basically
thats crazy that you can just do it in the command line.

I think i'll look into netbeans and see how well that works for me.  Oh and
from what I read netbeans intergrates with version control and bug trackers
too.  Kinda neat but idk if those are features i'd really use, at least not
now.

When I was doing non-WordPress PHP coding for a job, I used the
Eclipse IDE with the PHP extensions (whatever they're calling it
nowadays, that thing changes names a lot). Also used the SVN
extensions for it, which are frankly awesome.

Eclipse is one of those IDEs that is difficult to setup and get
working the way you want it, and it has a learning curve like the
Matterhorn, but once you really start using it, it's highly efficient
and fast. The project management becomes easier to deal with, working
with a team for a project becomes much simpler, deployment can be done
automatically if you want, etc. Plus, can't beat free.

And if you want to write in Java, it does that really well too. Call
me crazy, but I like Java sometimes.

Vim has syntax highlighting, plus a number of other great features. It's definitely my editor of choice. Add NerdTree and ZenCoding and you get some very powerful functionality, too.

Development environments are like operating systems, sports teams, or brands

Nobody has mentioned TextMate yet either, which I should imagine most Mac folk use.

Netbeans is my favorite but their current 7 beta is broken a lot. Great code
complete, collapsing/folding code, XDebug integration, SVN (I haven't
figured that out yet) etc.

Code complete includes WordPress functions and the PHPDoc explanations.

It gets my vote, but I haven't tried "everything".

Well, it doesn't fit your budget, but I definitely prefer Komodo IDE 
<http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide>.  I've used Zend Studio, 
Eclipse, Netbeans, vim (still use this a lot for smaller things) , 
notepad++, etc, and still prefer Komodo.

Unfortunately, it'll cost you about $300 (roughly the same as Zend 
Studio, which was what I used prior to finding Komodo).  I will say that 
for me, it paid for itself quickly.  I can switch between my many 
projects quickly, get prompted with parameters for the functions I 
haven't used in a while (even the non-native functions that are part of 
the project your working on), and commit files or get diffs via SVN or 
GIT with a quick shortcut key, etc.  Having a real IDE made me 
considerably more productive.

I use MacVim which is really just Vim with some GUI on top and the ability to use the mouse. I've also installed the Janus plugin for MacVim which helps if you're moving from a mouse driven system.

I used to use Textmate but ended up loving the full control from the keyboard that Vim/MacVim offers so found it lacking. You can install a Vim Keys plugin for Textmate that gives you basic Vimlike keyboard navigation but if you really dig in to Vim/MacVim you'll end up finding the plugin lacking since it doesn't do everything. Learning Vim/MacVim also has the advantage of making sure you're comfortable in the command line and if you need to ssh in to a server to edit stuff you already know how to use Vim so you're not in way over your head.

For version control I use Git Tower (Git) or Versions (SVN) as a GUI but also feel comfortable in command line (at least for Git which is my primary source control method). I'd say learn the command line first then use the GUI's when it's more efficient.

I'd throw my support to Komodo as well. PHP bug-checking and including ALL
the WordPress functions (assuming you tell it where the code is) as well as
jQuery syntax helpers is invaluable. Best IDE I think I've ever used, bar
none. The free version is almost as good as the full IDE:
http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit and is certainly good for the "try it
before you buy it" bit.

But like Dave said, they're like cars or sports teams - everyone prefers
something different. I recommend installing several free ones, giving them
all a good shot, and making your decision after you've used them all.

I switched to Sublime Text with the ZenCoding plugin about a year ago. It's
not a full IDE but it's by far the best, fastest and well thought through
editor I've ever used, with a super-clean UI and everything customisable
(colours, fonts, menus, keyboard).

http://www.sublimetext.com/

I just couldn't imagine coding without mini-map, bookmarks and multiple
selection editing now. Integrates nicely with WinSCP too.

Version 2 alpha is now available for Win/Mac/Linux (v1 is Win only):

Definitly Eclipse PDT (PHP developer tools)

I especially like a feature: ctrl + click on a function/class name
immediatly brings you to the code of that function/class. Eclipse's
autocomplete is great too.

I love Eclipse. I use it for almost everything on Win/Ubuntu/Mac. On
Win I also use Notepad++ as standard-editor for everything that's not
setup as an Eclipse workspace. On the Mac I had Smultron in addition
to Eclipse. The new Eclipse Orion project is worth a closer look, too.

Regards,
Gerrit

I use nano via ssh, notepad++ on Win, and Eclipse in Ubunto and 
occasionally on Win.

My only problem with nano is that I still have vi on the brain and I hit 
insert to make changes and then I have to ctrl-c out of the resulting menu.

Global variables work wonders here:

$post->post_category I believe is what you can set as your needed variable, then use wp_query or query_posts and cat=your variable to grab the proper category ID.

scintilla's scite gives great syntax highlighting in a variety of languages;
but it's by no means an IDE ... we just basically copy files from production

I use Aptana(http://www.aptana.com/) on Linux and Windows systems, all free;
for fast edit without IDE: Geany on Linux and UltraEdit or the free
alternative Notepad++ on Windows.

maybe you see on this table many IDEs and his features:
http://www.phpbar.de/index.php?title=PHP_IDE_Software%C3%BCbersicht&diff=20875&oldid=prev

Aptana is an IDE, in th kernel is Eclipse, and Aptana has add different
features(http://www.aptana.com/products/studio2) and better usability - my
mind. You can use Eclipse-Addons with Aptana, like for Git and SVN - works
fine.

also you can read more about my toolbox on this post:

I use Zend Studio on Linux at work, but find the Java IDE's (netbeans,
eclipse etc) run far too slow on Win. What's the point of function
prompts if googling it is quicker?

I have heard good things about Komodo, but I'm tight, so I use
PHPDesigner7. Not free but cheaper, relatively lightweight & does what
I need. Although it is a bit buggy I'm places. There's a free trial
available, I recommend having a go & seeing if it suits you.

Other than that, Vim is probably the answer.

That looks very interesting, but beyond the scope of what I had in
mind. For example, my plugin would just be to "get you started" rather
than offer a complete GUI for managing content types. Basically, it
will shortcut the tedious work of starting a new plugin and getting
the basics in place.

Absolutely, that's exactly what I'm thinking. You want to create a new
general-purpose plugin so you follow the wizard:

Step 1) Enter the general details (this will create the readme.txt)
Step 2) Choose what features the plugin will have:
- Options page
- Other admin screens
- Classes (you will be able to specify properties and methods)
- Custom tables (with the option to create classes that map to those
tables with CRUD code)
Step 3) The code is created in /plugins/ and you can edit it in the
IDE, or download it as a Zip

One other thing I am planning is making the plugin extensible, so
people can create other wizards that create different types of
plugins, or even other things in the future (child themes etc). At the
moment I'm staying away from the custom posts thing, as there are a
range of plugins that already allow you to create and manage those.

I suppose just because I can :0) This plugin will generate the basic
code that you can then edit either in the IDE, or by downloading the
generated code. The IDE will also handle editing other plugins, I
often find I need to have a more powerful editor in the browser when
trying to debug problems with my own plugins on different sites.

I agree, that would be good (just a WP-function-aware plugin for
Notepad++ would be good for me) but my skills don't lie in that area.
Are you volunteering to do that? ;0)

Do you mean the "One-click child theme creation" idea in that post?
Yep, seems good. That's exactly the sort of this an extension to my
plugin would be able to handle.

Thanks for the feedback everyone,

Subject: [wp-hackers] [GSoC 2011] Introduction + questions about some of the
	projects
Message-ID: <A134800A1CD84FF9A2AC0998D170E143@gmail.com>

Hi all,

My name is Sagie, I'm a first-year CS & linguistics student at Tel-Aviv University.
I've been a professional web developer for the last 6 years, mostly done PHP work.
I actually have a vast experience with the WordPress project, as I have used it both for personal use (and contributed a number of open-source plug-ins) and for my past jobs (where I sometimes had to work on serious tweaks to the system to allow for certain features).

I'm applying to GSoC this summer and given my experience with it and how much I like it, WordPress would be an ideal project for me and I'm very excited about this opportunity.

I wanted to ask you for your thoughts on some of the project ideas posted on the GSoC page:

* Comment Moderation
This sounds like a very useful feature and an interesting project to work on.
I was wondering if there's any more documentation on the needed work, maybe some sort of spec defining required functionality? Or should I work on one myself as part of the task?
I'm especially interested about what's required for the XML-RPC side.

* New User Walkthrough
Again, sounds very cool but I think I need to know more about what you guys were thinking of with this one.
Also, is this a full summer project? Because it seems smaller than all the other ones.

* Progress Bars
To plan for this feature, I'd need to know:
- What exactly is the list of functions where the progress bar should be embedded?
- In these functions, is there an indication from the server side on progress completed? Is development of that needed, or do we just "guestimate" on the UI side?

* Enhanced Emails
Certainly sounds like it's time for such a feature, but questions arise:
- Are the e-mail message designs customized as part of the theme?
- How to handle remote image elements? This could be a tough problem.
For example, IIRC to avoid Gmail's auto-hiding of such images, one has to identify the originating domain name with some CNAME record. How can we solve that on a platform level?

* Super-Accessible Admin
Another very important feature to implement. I think collaboration with UI and accessibility groups is crucial for this to have best results. I was wondering if you have a link to a best-practice example for such accessible admin dashboard, so I could wrap my head around what needs to be done.

Sorry for the length of this, I guess that's a result of my excitement about the WP project :)
Would love to get your thoughts and directions.
Thanks,

--

I use Aptana, it's based on Eclipse and PDT so it's full featured. I like
that it's easy to synchronize to FTP/SFTP servers and the highlighting/code
hinting is very nice as well.

It's free and you could probably do the same with just Eclipse / PDT but I'm
lazy and it comes bundled for Win/Mac/Linux.

Vim.

The major advantage of vim is, once you're familiar with it, it doesn't
matter wether you're editing a file on your workstation, on the server over
SSH, on an embedded device through a nullmodem terminal ... vim, or at least
vi, is almost always installed.

Emacs also very powerful, but not as available by default.

GVim is also ported to just about every platform in existence.

I used Coda and loved it. Thanks to a MacHeist bundle I also got a licence for it and so I tried MacRabbit's Espresso, but as it doesn't have built in SVN it wasn't of so much use.

Then I discovered the power of Netbeans and switched completely to it. It might be a bit slower than a native Application and it certainly doesn't look as nice as Espresso does, but it is so full of features (debugging, separation of wp-core and wp-content, code navigation, bookmarks, folding, etc.) that I can't live without it anymore. I tried to adapt the color scheme to match a nice Textmate theme and I use Espresso Mono as the font. I also have the editor constantly in full size.

Hello,

I am Abhishek Gupta second year undergraduate student at IIT Delhi <
http://abhishekgupta92.info >. I want to work on Education module which
enhances features to the wordpress like adding/enrolling courses, students.
There is a module namely teachpress <
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/teachpress/> which is aimed at same but
the module is not developed enough to be used when there are cms like moodle
available.

My motive for this is to promote community blogging in School/Institutions.
I have a community blog at the thelazy.info and feels the absence of such
module for my institution.

Other topic that interest me is CCK and Views module which can compete with
Drupal modules for the same. Currently there is a cck module in wordpress,
but the module is not really easy to use. In addition to this the user need
views module to generate flexible views of what he want to display.

I think that you should do something like this:

1. List all categories from a post and assign then to an Array
2. unset the ID from the category you wish to remove
3. wp_update_post( array('ID' => $post->ID,'post_category' =>
$arraywithcats));

Message-ID: <AANLkTinx-pDckS049qgRCaBpM3QVp97PzBL1jjM5LnX-@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My name is Maulik Kamdar, a pre-final year undergraduate student at the
Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I was a past Google Summer of Code
student in 2010 under Drupal working on the project of HTML 5 Support to
Drupal 7.

I had developed two modules during that period, one which extended HTML 5
features of video, audio, form elements and another which developed
Automated Graphs using HTML 5 Canvas and RGraph API.

I am very much interested to work under Wordpress for GSoC 2011 on their
project of "File Uploader".
This was one of the feature I had included under my previous project, a
crude video of which can be found here [1]. It utilized the Swell JS API for
the Drag and Drop Upload of Files, however the project seems discontinued
now [2]. I had maintained the security hooks, as can be seen in the video
which automatically converts a .js file to a .txt file due to security
reasons. Moreover, it integrated a functional progress bar and allowed
upload of almost all kinds of files, by dropping them into the content area.
(No support for multiple file uploads however)

The features that I was thinking of incorporating in the following proposal
were as follows:

   - Upload Progress Bar
   - Multiple File Upload
   - Drag and Drop File Upload
   - Searching for an appropriate API (Swell JS is one, but is not actively
   maintained anymore)
   - Support for Google Gears and compatibility across major browsers.

Are there anymore feature requests based on this?
I suppose it would be beneficial to develop it into a plugin which can be
activated when required?

Maybe bad choice of words - you do get a segmentation fault and the child
ids of Apache processes are killed, but true, Apache itself stays up.

It's highly repeatable and reproducable - but in the context of WPBook
2.1.4 and WordPress 3.0.5. With no additional themes other than the
default installed, and no additional plugins other than WPBook.

Certainly could be the way WPBook is both filtering theme_root and calling
get_themes in the same context.

I'll keep investigating- likely it is a problem in our code.

Sounds good, except the last one. WordPress used to support Google Gears,
but it's dead now. Long live HTML 5 Offline Application Cache!

It would be nice to start out as a plugin, but I think you'll have a hard
time integrating into the current media management window.

Without a server-side indicator, we would stick to spinners, no? You will

No, that's not a requirement, although it would probably be nice if the

You don't need to worry about auto-hiding. In general, avoid any server
depedendent features.

Abhishek,

I wrote a plugin called Virtual Pages (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/virtual-pages/) which is meant to grow
into a Views module for WordPress. Right now, it tries to give a
user-friendly interface to query_posts's parameters and lets you map them to
URLs.

For some people, it works wonderfully. For others, it doesn't work at all,
and I've never been able to figure out why (never gave it much time,
either).

I don't know if it falls within the scope of GSoC, but I'd love any help
getting this working for everyone and maybe adding some features to make it
more like Views.

PHP code should never be able to cause a segfault, as it's an
interpreted language.

So if you're actually segfaulting, then you've found a bug in the
version of PHP or Apache you're using, or there's a library
incompatibility, or something like that.

You unset to remove that category entry from the actual list of categories
that your post have and then reassign the new array with that category left
out.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=jCfCu_7jdiN4yxjXdSd8wSRLgyPRw6Z7hfV_7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I'm thinking about applying for GSoc and the project I found the most
interesting is the enhancement of GlotPress.
However, when looking for more details I noticed that this idea was posted
last year too, without any students applying. The last post in the GP Blog
is from July. So my question is: who should I contact about this GSoC
project, is there an assigned mentor?

I have used various software translation tools and sites (my most recent
project is translating MuseScore to Hungarian) so I have some ideas. Apart
from the enhancements listed on the GSoc Codex page, it would be very useful
to have a glossary for projects, so translators could use a consistent
terminology without constantly having to search for phases containing a
specific word (for example, in the Facebook translation system, the glossary
translations had to be agreed upon before translating anything).
Listing similar strings would help too (this is not the same as fuzzy
matching: the goal is not to automagically translate strings but to help the
translators to use similar expressions across the project).

The mentor would be exactly the author of the GlotPress blog, namely
Nikolay.

This idea is an extension of "New User Walkthrough". Instead of keeping a

will create a *Health Index* for WordPress installation which initially will

be created which can be used by other plug-ins to hook into it and add their
own list of things for users to do and their own ongoing site health
info. For example, a forum (like BBPress or SimplePress) might want to have
a user upload an avatar or put unread threads or private messages into the
list, etc. Depending on Health Index user may be send email/sms
notifications like WordPress installation is in Critical Stage, etc.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Image Permalinks (GSOC Project)
Message-ID: <AANLkTinFRoJdmao7rYhDtLGCf5xMZhfya7G8m15zTBA+@mail.gmail.com>

I am graduate student and I want to contribute via Google Summer of Code.

This is one of my ideas:

Abstract

Image permalinks is an idea for extension of the following permalinks
functionality of WordPress. The current directory structure for WordPress
images is /wp-content/year/month/imagename.ext. This URL structure is not
SEO friendly for Image search on the most valuable search engines, such as
Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc. When we attach images, these URLs appear in src
attribute of a tag. If we want to make our posts more SEO friendly for image
search and give more traffic from image search, these images should be
rewriten with other directory structure, such as /images/tag/imagename.ext
or /images/category/imagename.ext. I think that would be better to do in the
core of WP than in a plugin. The implementation consists of checking option
"Image Rewriting" in Settings->Permalinks and when some image is attached to
post to extend the wizard for attaching images with choosing keyword and
structure for rewritten URL. I plan to use the class WP_Rewrite and
modifications of $form_fields in /wp-admin/includes/media.php.

Best Regards,
Marko

First of all, if GSoC was about who had the best idea, if you describe your
idea in detail, in public, if someone were to "copy" it, you would have
evidence that you came up with it first.

Secondly, students that freely share their ideas will get better feedback
overall and get extra points when their proposals are evaluated.

So get over yourself.

Why so harsh? Is it necessary to be nasty to someone new and who is attempting to contribute just because they don't understand the process?

English is not scribu's first language, and I'm sure he didn't mean to 
come across that way. He asked me what the right response was for 
someone afraid of posting an idea to hackers for fear of idea theft, and 
while I told him the stuff about the date of hackers emails showing who 
originated an idea when (not that we have ever actually had that 
problem), I also started with a semi-joking "they should get over the 
idea of theft in an open source environment." The "get over" was 
probably reused and wound up sounding harsh, due to the difference in 
meaning based on sentence construction and object (get over yourself 
sounds harsh and personal, get over the idea of theft does not). I 
believe scribu wanted to be encouraging and it just came out wrong.

The process is pretty clearly stated on the Codex page, specifically in 
the application template, which includes an area for referencing 
when/how a student has discussed ideas on wp-hackers.

Sorry from my side. I read this on some blog about dos and don'ts.

*Abstract
*

*
*

This idea is an extension of "New User Walkthrough". Instead of keeping a
module only for new installation related tasks we could keep it this way. We
will create a *Health Index* for WordPress installation which initially will
be determined by tasks like pick a theme, change your password, edit your
tagline, choose your comment settings, etc. After all this new user tasks
notifications like availability of updates of WordPress , important plug-ins
like Akismet , pending comments , etc will determine Health Index. Hooks can
be created which can be used by other plug-ins to hook into it and add their
own list of things for users to do and their own ongoing site health
info. For example, a forum (like BBPress or SimplePress) might want to have
a user upload an avatar or put unread threads or private messages into the
list, etc. Depending on Health Index user may be send email/sms
notifications like WordPress installation is in Critical Stage, etc.


*Details*


Health Index will be determined by 3 parameter *Hardware
settings*,*internal settings
* and *plug-in settings*.
There will be 3 level of notification *critical, important and general*.

*Hardware settings* ( Only they can have critical notifications)

   - Minimum required PHP version
   - MySQL version
   - Cron and Apache settings (this may be used by plug-ins in need of
   specific setting)
   - Mail server setting (smtp etc)

*Internal settings*

   - All "New User Walkthrough" tasks.
   - pending comments
   - clearing spam/ trash
   - updates for WordPress / Plug-ins
   - Installation for recommended tasks like spams (e.g Akismet), seo ( e.g
   Headspace), sitemap (e.g Google xml sitemap), Visitor tracking, Feed, etc

*Plug-in settings* ( This is best of all )

   - Every plug-in will be given a hook for pre-requisite or configuration
   required for some plug-ins like wp-super cache , etc to check whether a
   certain setting was made or configured properly before start its
   functioning.
   - A general level notification hook will be provide to all plug-ins. (I
   think we should impose upper limit on number of hooks attempts)
   - Plug-in deletion and file damage procedure


A admin widget will be placed on dashboard in wp-admin section displaying
all important things like notifications by priority and Health Index over
all taken by minimum of 3.

A admin page can also be created which will give user ability to change some
settings like *plug-in settings* can be made suppressible. Notifications can
be disabled for some settings. If WordPress.org have a SMS gateway that can
be used for SMS notification else free gateways like www.zeepmobile.com

could be implemented along with email.

This is my idea. What do you think , is it good enough for a GSoC project ??


Any comments could be helpful.

What you're actually proposing is a general notification API, which would be
nice.

 - Plug-in deletion and file damage procedure

I don't really undertand what you mean by "file damage procedure".

yes a sort of notification but i want to make it extensive for plugins as
well.

File damage may include cases like :-
1 accidental file permission errors
2 For some techsavvy users : misplaced plug-in or theme files etc

Do you think this idea is good enough as a GSoC project ?? Personally i
think its a bit small and easy to do.

Hi,
personally I think a lot of this was already done by Mike last summer:
http://gsoc2010.wordpress.com/mike-whitfield-setup-meter/

Just my 2 cents, since no one mentioned Setup Meter already.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Custom queries
Message-ID: <AANLkTik-YcCa3pUYq78kBvZ86UXxEe+vfAinMrdk=TXm@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm developing a real-estate site and need a custom search form.
The site search is based on price, number of rooms, location and
accommodation type (condo, appartment, etc...)

I'm using accommodation type and location as custom taxonomies.
price and # of rooms are special fields.

Here is the current custom search I'm using:
SELECT wposts.*
    FROM $wpdb->posts wposts
    LEFT JOIN $wpdb->postmeta price ON (wposts.ID = price.post_id AND
price.meta_key = 'price')
    LEFT JOIN $wpdb->postmeta rooms ON (wposts.ID = rooms.post_id AND
rooms.meta_key = 'rooms')
    LEFT JOIN $wpdb->term_relationships ON (wposts.ID =
$wpdb->term_relationships.object_id)
    LEFT JOIN $wpdb->term_taxonomy ON
($wpdb->term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id =
$wpdb->term_taxonomy.term_taxonomy_id)
    WHERE wposts.post_status = 'publish'
    AND price.meta_value BETWEEN  $pmin AND $pmax
    AND rooms.meta_value BETWEEN  $rmin AND $rmax
    AND $wpdb->term_taxonomy.taxonomy = 'category'
    AND $wpdb->term_taxonomy.term_id = $catid

I want to add the custom taxonomies select to this query (i.e. if I get
type=30) add that to the conditions.
since I have to custom taxonomies I need something that works for multiple
values with AND condition...

Any idea will be appreciated,
Thanks
Hannit

Honestly, Scrap whatever you're doing there and use the Taxonomy Queries and
Meta queries in WordPress 3.1..

Use these:

I am graduate student and I want to contribute via Google Summer of Code.

This is one of my ideas:

Abstract

Image permalinks is an idea for extension of the following permalinks
functionality of WordPress. The current directory structure for WordPress
images is /wp-content/year/month/imagename.ext. This URL structure is not
SEO friendly for Image search on the most valuable search engines, such as
Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc. When we attach images, these URLs appear in src
attribute of a tag. If we want to make our posts more SEO friendly for image
search and give more traffic from image search, these images should be
rewriten with other directory structure, such as /images/tag/imagename.ext
or /images/category/imagename.ext. I think that would be better to do in the
core of WP than in a plugin. The implementation consists of checking option
"Image Rewriting" in Settings->Permalinks and when some image is attached to
post to extend the wizard for attaching images with choosing keyword and
structure for rewritten URL. I plan to use the class WP_Rewrite and
modifications of $form_fields in /wp-admin/includes/media.php.

Please, give me some feedback, I have already posted this idea,
but no one have commented me yet.

Best Regards,
Marko

any particular issue ?? And its still mentioned on Idea's page.

One more thing Mike has not worked on

*Plug-in settings*

   - Every plug-in will be given a hook for pre-requisite or configuration
   required for some plug-ins like wp-super cache , etc to check whether a
   certain setting was made or configured properly before start its
   functioning.
   - A general level notification hook will be provide to all plug-ins. (I
   think we should impose upper limit on number of hooks attempts)
   - Plug-in deletion and file damage procedure

* For example, a forum (like BBPress or SimplePress) might want to have a
user upload an avatar or put unread threads or private messages into the
list, etc. Depending on Health Index user may be send email/sms
notifications like WordPress installation is in Critical Stage, etc.*


And simple messages are used as notifications.

The parent post's taxonomies can't be used for image URL rewriting: What
happens when the original post is deleted? What happens when an image is
inserted in more than one post? What happens when that category is deleted?

This would imply that we add a category taxonomy for images, or at least a
custom field for the permalink.

PS: On a multisite installation, image URLs are already rewritten (see the
blogs.dir thingy)

There are a lot of mechanisms for WP debugging, such as some plugins,
wp_debug variable, print_r, log, etc. I'd like to know your experience about
WordPress debugging in some IDE with breakpoints and watches. I prefer Linux

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=y=Gp042w_cus9xFZGMak0isX7cAuJzPqJ1aQC@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

My name is Lucas, I'm an undergraduate at the Imperial College London, and
I'd like to contribute to GSoC. The idea I found the most interesting is
enhancement of moderation of threaded comments.

Features I'd like to enhance Wordpress with:
- threaded view of comments in "Comments",
- threaded view of comments when editing individual comment,
- widget for "Edit comment" with preview of the thread,
- indication of threading in Dashboard's "Recent comments"
- re-parenting in "Recent comments", "Edit comment" and directly on the
blog,
- re-parenting using html5/jquery drag'n'drop,
- extension of Wordpress XML-RPC api to allow for external re-parenting

Threaded view would show entire thread, with old comments indicated by
datetime and author, and new comments shown normally. It is because, in case
of threaded comments, context of a comment is important, and also
re-parenting would be easier if admin/editor could see comment's parent.

What do you think? Anything I forgot about and what would be useful?

Regards,

I think reparenting via drag'n'drop in the "Edit comments" admin screen
would be enough.

Another nice feature would be moving a comment from one post to another. See
the "Move comments" plugin.

If a new parent is close, drag'n'drop would the most comfortable and
quickest way of?re-parenting. Even tough users will make more mistakes
using this type of interface, they can quickly fix them. For non d'n'd
interface, in case of a mistake one would have to go again, through a
long list of comments, and pick the right one. That's why I think both
of them should be used together wherever possible, otherwise only
certain screens would benefit from d'n'd.

Comments moving - I looked a bit and found that it is especially
useful when a discussion gets longer and has to be moved to a
dedicated post to save loading time. Except for simple comment moving,
'discussion moving' could be added, so after given number of comments,
discussion would be moved, link to the discussion added under the
post, and commenting locked.

 Hey Marko, I've had great success with debugging WordPress using
NetBeans. You can attach the debugger and get breakpoints, variables,
watches, step over and into etc. Every thing you'd want.

If you want details on my setup let me know.

Erm no, that's what comment paging is for.

Would be nice to have the option to move "this comment and all it's
children", though.

Good point.

Yup, one misplaced comment may create entire misplaced thread.
I think maybe it should be a default behavior of re-parenting and
moving, of course with option for individual treatment.

If we assume that a reply is related to its parent by content, than if
parent is misplaced, the entire subtree should be moved along with it.

Message-ID: <D89B1910-7A91-4630-ABA5-1C96DF2D8DD8@garyc40.com>

Hi all,

I'm preparing my application fro GSoC this year. It would be great to have some feedback from WP hackers for my idea. Below you can find the excerpt. The proposal is long, so please take some time to read the full version at http://www.garyc40.com/?p=150

Thanks!

Gary.

==========================================

Overview (tl;dr)

One day I came across this ticket (http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423), and decided that this would make a good component of my GSoC proposal. In addition to restoring code highlighting when editing theme / plugin, I also want to revamp the user interface of this feature so that it?s easier to use and more pleasant to look at.

I don?t intend to make this feature comparable to a full fledged text editor that lives within WordPress. Instead, the aim is to make it more usable and convenient for small code editing tasks that don?t require much server side debugging.

This can be implemented as a plugin, and later integrated into core if desirable.

A very rough mock-up of the proposed UI: http://www.garyc40.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Editor.png

Full proposal: http://www.garyc40.com/?p=150

I've been extremely happy with PhpStorm+Zend Debugger on the Mac.  I first tried NetBeans but it was sluggish and the debugging experience was less than usable compared to PhpStorm. PhpStorm also has a lot more high-end coding features for finding and refactoring code.  Definitely worth the US$99 for a personal license. JMTCW.

Hello Friends,
I have recently been developing a Paper Conference Management System,
during which the need arises of multiple report generations. The
database being normalized, the queries then comprises of various joins
and conditions.

So, I am thinking of developing a Natural Language to SQL Translator,
I have done the background work and it just requires 2 json files,
which need to be given to the
PHP script. Consider it as a metadata for the given system.

It take queries like :

get author details with papers(name = "ABC") with tracks(name = "XYZ")

and generates SQL queries like :

SELECT authors.id, authors.name
FROM authors,papers,tracks
WHERE authors.id = papers.id AND
papers.track_id = tracks.id AND
papers.name = "ABC" AND
tracks.name = "XYZ"

I would like to develop this as a wordpress module for my GSOC project.

Also, one of the modules which can be developed for GSOC project, is a
desktop notification module, which can be used to give out desktop
notifications from any Wordpress website to user's browser, which
support desktop notifications like Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium,
etc.

Same here. I'm very happy with the capabilities of NetBeans when it comes to debugging. I can usually do quite everything inside it. It also handles the division between wordpress-core and wp-content without any problems and helps a great deal this way.

Nevertheless very often I fall back to the old var_dump/error_log combo, especially when I want to debug some stuff inside the loop or when I want to see what just happened in Core.

It's actually pretty easy to set up. First of all you need to get the debugging running with Netbeans and Apache. This is done by installing the XDEBUG Plugin and enabling in in the php.ini. 

Here's how the part looks like in my php.ini, you'll most probably just need to change the path to the module:

[xdebug]
zend_extension="/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5.2/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20060613/xdebug.so"
xdebug.remote_enable=1
xdebug.remote_handler=dbgp
xdebug.remote_mode=req
xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.remote_port=9000
xdebug.idekey=
xdebug.profiler_enable=0
xdebug.profiler_output_dir=/tmp/
xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger=1

I also enabled the profiling methods in xdebug to be available when appending XDEBUG_PROFILE=1 to the Querystring. In that case I get a nice profiling cachegrind file in /tmp I can then analyze either in WinCacheGrind (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wincachegrind/) or WebGrind (http://sourceforge.net/projects/wincachegrind/). There's sadly no free Mac client. :(

In Netbeans I followed the instructions found in netbeans wiki http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/configure-php-environment-mac-os.html, but other then enabling "Watches and Balloon Evaluation" nothing needs to be done, IIRC.

You can then start debugging out of the IDE by setting breakpoints and using the "Debug Main Project" Button in the toolbar.

One more information about how I set up the projects in my IDE. When we decided to move to WordPress we wanted to have a good way to guarantee that nobody in the team changed anything in the wordpress core. Therefore we decided to relocate wp-content by setting WP_CONTENT_DIR to the project dir. Wordpress core is always in /var/www/wordpress-core and is updated via svn to the current trunk or tag depending on what I'm currently working on.

Netbeans makes it extremely easy to run this kind of setup! My nbproject files are in the project repository and the core is included in the project by setting /var/www/wordpress-core as a Global Include Path in the PHP settings in NetBeans' preferences.

Hope this helps!

I just wanted to let all the folks on this list know, that I fixed a client site that was getting horrible performance by switching the post and post meta tables to Innodb from MyIsam.

They have over 40,000 posts in their database and publish all day long, 20-30 posts per day.  Consequently, their were constantly writing revisions to the DB. They would have 3 or 4 post edit windows open per user at once, constantly locking up the entire posts database.

I am not a DB expert, but I was recommended to make the switch by the engineers at Rackspace and it made huge difference.  The stacked queries went away immediatly.  

Just thought I would let you know, since it would have saved me a bunch of headache if I had know this last week,,,

Wow - this is the first full OpenSource debugging solution I've seen. I 
didn't know there was one out there.

You've just added to my to do list, but thank you!

The Windows documentation is here:
http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/configure-php-environment-windows.html

I think I'll have to try this out on a staging server to see how much it 
affects performance.

I wonder if you can set xdebug.remote_enable  at runtime..

Please don't call it a Natural Language Translator. You're merely proposing
a specialized syntax.

Also, I think it's too obscure for a GSoC project and too small.

Now that's interesting.

PS: There already was something like this for Windows 7, which didn't
involve a browser at all.

Yes that was a good move. InnoDB is actually the default engine in MySQL 
5.5.  The reason is sped everything up is that MyISAM locks the table 
when it does writes and you were creating a huge bottleneck.  This 
conversion is a given on just about all of the upgrade projects I'm 
involved in now.

One caution: MyISAM and InnoDB use two different sets of memory cache.  
So you're server is now using more memory than it was before. If memory 
ever becomes an issue, you might want to consider moving all of the 
tables of all of your heavily used databases over to InnoDB and reduce 
or eliminate the MyISAM cache resources.

Thanks scribu,
Well, yes you can call it a specialized syntax, but it is definitely a
better way for querying and customization of query results. But, there are
certain cases which need to be taken care of while developing it, and is not
so obscure as you suppose it is. I am attaching the documentation prepared
by me for getting myself a better idea.

And the desktop notification module can be implemented for the various
platforms which support desktop notifications, they are very good to support
systems which offer notifications on changes.

I think both of these modules can be implemented during each of the
evaluations of GSoC.

I had success with Eclipse yesterday.
I set XDebug configuration similar to Martin,
in Eclipse options XDebug as debugger.

For debugging, I ran index.php as script, added breakpoints,
and had successful debugging sessions.

I will test NetBeans and PHPStorm and compare with Eclipse.

Best Regards,
Marko

I also noticed improved performance from switching the comments,
commentsmeta, and options tables to InnoDB as well. Changing the
options table seemed to increase overall performance everywhere,
albeit only slightly. The options tables tend to get written to a lot
by normal use. Comments showed a good amount of improvement because I
get a lot of comments on my sites. :)

InnoDB has gotten to the point where it's just a better default than
MyISAM for most cases. I would only use MyISAM for a table that is
large and often read-only.

I notice a performance boost on comments, if i use innodb.
And on posts, esspecilly pages it is not better, same values.

On myisam you have an blocking on change/write access on tables, innodb has
this not - was create for banking-access, is more secure in the idea. But
myisam can compressive different access and innodb write datas on harddisc
and so it is possible, innodb is slower.

But i think, mySQL 5.5 has innodb as default and is faster than older
version, maybe you can test with a newer version from mySQL.

Best regards
Frank

I wonder if anyone tested WP with Percona Server (a MySQL replacement with a powerful innodb-based engine and many other great patches, built by one of the major MySQL consultance firm in the world..). 

I'm just trying to compile it and have a test run but I'd love to know if someone had the same thought..

One of my ideas is to do support for media (images and embedded videos).
There are some features which I'd like to discuss about them:

   - Adding videos from premium services to media gallery, such as images
   to register embedded videos as post
   - Support for embedded playlists
   - A rotator on the first page of images and videos from posts
   (see: http://espn.go.com/ top stories and sportcenter videos)
   - Image slideshows in posts
   - Image management in the admin section similar to Facebook
   - Support to attach a resized image into a post

I'd like to know more about discussed topics in GSoC idea list:

   - Better gallery functions
   - More user settings for media files and templates
   - What are media templates in WP?

Best Regards,
Marko

The mailing list strips attachments.

It would be better to post it on your blog, since you need to do that
anyway.

I assume it's the image.php attachment.php theme files that WP recognizes.

Message-ID: <AANLkTim_2LWoJ1=iR7CcqM59RTT5F9AnC6sycfZn9zN2@mail.gmail.com>

Unlike other applicants applying for "Moving Wordpress" idea, my
approach is fairly different in the implementation. My idea is to make
the plugin work on different platforms and server environments.

The idea of moving is a 2 step process - moving files and moving
database (and editing it on the fly). Moving files is fairly trivial
using FTP. Moving database gets tricky as it depends on the server
environment. Some shared hosts wouldn't allow remote connections, some
wouldn't allow executing shell_exec which could be used for importing
database using shell commands.

My idea is to use a group of methods for database movement which would
allow the plugin to work across most of the server configuration and
host. The methods will be tried in decreasing order of performance.
So, my plugin will first try to move database with a method that
provides best performance, if it fails, it tries second best method
until it finds a method which works. If all methods get exhausted, an
appropriate error is thrown.

The basic approach is to make the plugin work for most users rather
than providing them humongous list of features which don't work on
half the servers.

I'd like some feedback on this.

That's a good approach. It's how the HTTP and FTP APIs function.

The specialize syntax sounds like really useful functionality.  I've not explored how to be a mentor (so might be too late) but would seriously consider mentoring on this project if it is still an option.

Hi,

I would like to take this as my GSOC proposal. But I'm still having some
doubts in the issue described in the ideas page.

Why we have a progress bar for tasks like Publishing a post. It happens so
fast and the current system seems good. But we have to standardise 'File
Uploading' and 'Plugin Installation' progress bar's.

Message-ID: <AANLkTin18ULnD7M9+-oRTrkSTXjuYVUNhj9cLGyLmphh@mail.gmail.com>

I consider to choose language packs module as GSoC project.
This could be the plugin which download mo file for plugins or themes
from GlotPress if exists for current language.

This plugin may also support for multi-language blog.
There are some plugins like WPMU, see here
http://www.webdesignbooth.com/wordpress-multi-languages-5-plugins-to-built-a-multilingual-website/

I cannot understand this sentence in ideas page:
"Work is also necessary in GlotPress for this (support for plugins and
themes, ability to build download packages, etc.), so this task can probably
serve as two separate projects."
I cannot understand what could be done in the GlotPress side.

It also could be done automatic support for plugin and theme localization in
plugin API,
because it could be only localized plugins with the following segment of
code:

$locale_name  = get_locale();
$mofile_name  = dirname(__FILE__) . '/languages';
$mofile_name .= "/$domain_name-$locale_name.mo";
load_textdomain("domain", $mofile_name);
load_plugin_textdomain('domain', false, dirname( plugin_basename( __FILE__ )
) . '/languages/');

Nice idea,
actually I wrote a plugin for the 1st proposed part. I was lucky Nikolay
was around and enabled .mo downloads on GlotPress :)

http://stas.github.com/localize/

The problem with current language support is that it can't be applied to
every plugin that exists in plugins directory. And that is for a couple
of reasons, like:
* plugins cannot benefit from GlotPress awesomeness so far (at least not
on translate.wordpress.org)
* plugin translations are mainly "accidental" contributions, and there
are no dedicated teams like <langCode>.wordpress.org that can solve this
problem, nor much people that would do this to cover all existent
languages

To help you develop an idea about all this stuff, here's what I would
do:
* talk to Nikolay about current status of GlotPress and what it needs to
get integrated with plugin repos (readme.txt will have to suffer
modifications and plugins will have to deliver .pot files mandatory in
this case)
* to reduce the "noise" of obsolete/old plugins locale imports, an
approval system should be written and automated that will validate the
plugin code for gettext calls and .pot file existence. From here you are
free to propose all kind of awesomeness, like integration with
profiles.wordpress.org to "number of X people required before plugin
will get accepted for a translation".
* a new pot-bot will have to be written :D

Good luck with this idea, though from my last year experience, you will
have to demonstrate more than just interest to get a project related
to .org infrastructure accepted.

Just my 2 cents...

The idea isn't to replace every single spinner in the admin with a progess
bar, just the actions that take longer and have measurable time to
completion.

Mihai,

I think your idea sounds like a fantastic idea, but I have a couple of
concerns.

First, you suggest using localStorage for image/media as well.  Some
browsers place size limits on localStorage (I've seen 5MB for some systems,
10MB for others, and unlimited for a few).  How do you expect to work with
this limitation?

I'm just assuming you'll have some kind of graceful degradation in place for
the ~22% of users who don't have access to localStorage (using the stats you
referenced in your proposal).  I'm a huge fan of using new technologies, but
I know from personal experience that a lot of end users (think larger
corporations using WordPress for intranet sites and corporate blogs) are
tied to specific browser versions that don't support localStorage - some IT
departments still force IE7 company-wide, and it doesn't support this system
at all.

Since your stated goal is to drop Flash "in time" rather than immediately,
do you plan to leave existing systems in place for users of outdated
systems?

Anybody know if there's a way (via plugin or some way that doesn't 
involved core code hacking) that could allow individual blog operators 
in a multisite WP platform to install their own plugins and themes? I 
know WP doesn't allow that normally and that site admins have control 
over it. What I'm wonder is if there's a way to hand that control over 
to the individual blog admins, so effective multisite winds up running 
similar to a run single-site WP install.

The problem you have there is that allowing an Administrator to
install a plugin will allow them to do anything on the site, including
promoting themself to a Super Administrator (as you're giving them the
ability to run any code in the form of a plugin).

Therefore, probably not a good idea.

Hey guys,

The title says it all - is it possible to put a box, an arbitrary one
through a custom metabox above the box which contains what will be
outputted in the_content(); - either this or to rearrange the_excerpt
box so it is above it. Clearly one can, in some cases, drag and drop,
but I would like this to be displayed by default.

Thanks a lot.

If you take a look at the TwentyTen CRM theme (
http://www.billerickson.net/twentyten-crm/ ) you can see how we moved the
post editor inside a meta box (Notes), so it can then be rearranged like any
other meta box.

In the functions.php file around line 247 you'll find "Begin moving post
editor to notes metabox"

It's simple,
contributors are far not only the coders, people who write documentation
or do support on forums/irc, the translators are also contributors.

I have gone through the present android app for mobiles and I think it is
limited to posts, comments and pages only. I will extend admin section
interface including features like plug-in ,theme administration, Core admin
settings, Widgets and User management. A web like admin section ( in term of
functionality will be developed ) on Android App for Mobiles. Hence my
project has two major parts:-

1. Create XML-RPC APIs required for new features.

2. Apply new XML-RPC calls to develop client in Android app with new
feature.

I recommend working with Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) to exploit the newly
launched fragment APIs in Android.

Hello Eric,

Thank you for the interest shown in my idea.

     My first reaction to your first concern (hitting the localStorage 
size limit) was "well that's easy, I'll just periodically read for the 
available size and prompt the user for more space when needed". But I 
wasn't really sure if there was a way to do with through the API . So I 
headed over to http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#disk-space.
"User agents may prompt the user when quotas are reached, allowing the 
user to grant a site more space. This enables sites to store many 
user-created documents on the user's computer, for instance."

Much like on the file system, it is out of the hands of the application 
what happens when we run out of space, but a graceful solution should be 
provided by the browser. Anyway, even 5 MB is a lot of space when all 
you store is text.

As for your other concerns, I have specified in the proposal that these 
projects would be delivered at first as (separate) plug-ins, so no 
unsuspecting user would use this features at first. But yes, when it 
comes to the File uploader, where less than half of all browsing 
citizens would have support for that (maybe it would be more, 
considering wordpress.com browser usage, don't know, but still) it would 
be irresponsible to degrade the current experience for innovations' and 
"ooh, shiny"'s sake.

The local backup fallback solution is actually what I would consider 
kind of a challenge. I suspect that upon detection of the lack of 
localStorage, the plugin could keep all the logs it would normally keep 
in a custom object and when the user would want to save a draft/post a 
post offline, it would prompt to save that object to a file, and remind 
the user upon going online to upload the file so the post would be 
updated. This is very preliminary, and indeed, quite a challenge to 
obtain a similar experience on all platforms (which, to be honest, was 
not my initial intention with the plugins, but it's a good concept 
nevertheless).


Thanks,
Mihai

Stas,

You'd have to write it up in more detail for anyone to "confirm" anything.
It sounds like an interesting idea, but we need more information about what
you want to do.

What do you consider as:
like integration with profiles.wordpress.org to "number of X people required
before plugin will get accepted for a translation".

What should do X people to translation be accepted?

For example,
get a box like this one
http://i.imgur.com/Rq1YB.png

where people will vote up for "localization needed".

A lot of ways can be developed to involve people in getting feedback.

Btw, stop asking me what you have to do, in the end it's you who will
apply with this project, use the force Luke :)

I think this sounds a bit too ambitious. Something like XML-RPC needs
to be tested extensively, and planning to add this much additional
functionality to the API, and then still have time to go and write it
all into the Android application is probably biting off more than you
can chew.

Just adding all of the XML-RPC stuff and testing it properly would
probably be an entire project on its own.

Also to make life easier for people reviewing your work, this could be
all done as a plugin for your project, then merged into core if that
was deemed appropriate later.

Under "if time permits" you have "Document new APIs". This should be a
much higher priority than an after-thought.

If you're specifically wanting to get to the Android programing part,
it might make sense to just make a certain subset of functionality
available via XML-RPC + implemented on the Android app.

Hope that helps,
Beau

I wrote this idea, and if it works out I will likely mentor the project. As
explained, GlotPress does need a bit of work to ensure it can scale to
support thousands of projects. Currently, the plugins that are in GlotPress
(the importers, etc.) were imported manually. We'll need to build a bridge
to the plugins directory, and possibly make some tweaks to GP.

Some of this might fall under GSoC, some of it might fall under WP.org
infrastructure. This is a project we want to do regardless, and it's
definitely a goal of mine for 2011.

  It also could be done automatic support for plugin and theme localization

Nope, that code really isn't necessary. Ideally, language packs in core will
prevent any plugin author from doing anything beyond internationalizing the
plugin under a unique textdomain. After that, we can simply load the
textdomain based on what's available. Simple as that, no need for the plugin
itself to do any loading.

The idea would be that language packs would automate a great majority of
what currently falls on plugin authors, blog administrators, and
translators, and make it easier to keep everything working and updated.

Replying to Stas' comments, there's no need for plugins to even deliver .pot
files. Those, again, could be generated automatically and imported into
GlotPress. Things like an approval system might be necessary, but again,
that's more on the GlotPress side, while there's quite a bit of work that
needs to be done from the plugin/core side.

Hope that helps,
Nacin

Not sure,
additional work would be required to create "sanboxes" where code is
checked out from svn, parsed, and than imported into GP.
All of this can be handled by devs by simply using a standard directory
(lets say `languages`) or adding a new line in `readme.txt` with the
location of .pot file. Also by asking them to offer .pot file, you make
sure the author did his homework and read about localization api.

Anyway, I wouldn't touch GP at all from that side, and work on a
"bridge/pot-bot" as you and I already mentioned that will handle all the
imports and voted plugins in translation queue.

Another question that rises is plugin directory api, that one will also
require an update. So the plugin installation process will include a
confirmation from a user if he wants to also download the translation
for the new/updated plugin.

Subject: [wp-hackers] [GSoC 2011] Attractive graphical forms,
 microsurveys and surveys editor with statistics.
Message-ID: <4D924904.9060306@inventcore.net>

I am Bogumila Kochanska. I'm a second year student of Informatics at 
Gdansk University of Technology.
I want to apply to GSoC making contribution to WordPress by implementing 
my idea - forms editor and statistics analyzer.

It should support three kinds of forms:
* Typical forms (like contact or offer request)
* Micro-surveys ("I like it"/"I dislike it", "Yes"/"Don't know"/"No", "I 
agree"/"I don't agree"...) with optional users comments.
* Surveys

I want to make:
1) easy editor for forms in Dashboard. Every form field have choosable 
properties like: type, validator, image (with or without text), and other.
It could be visual with drag&drop support.
2) managment panel for forms results and statistic viewer. Results can 
be stored in dashboard or sent to administrator/moderators.
3) forms templates with graphics. And opportunity to pin own CSS or 
upload images.
4) high user experience, nice graphics, effects and simple usage.

What do you think about this?

There already are plenty of good plugins for form management (including
commercial ones) and since this isn't Core material, I don't think it would
make a good GSoC project.

We already have pot creation tools, as well as SVN tracking tools. On
commit, generate a new pot file and import it. In fact each of these steps
are already done in various scripts, we'd just work (on the wp.org side) to
bring them together for this new project.

Anyway, I wouldn't touch GP at all from that side, and work on a

It can and should be transparent, based on the availability of the
translation and the site's language settings. We'd create a new API (or
version of an existing API) on api.wordpress.org that would notify when
language packs are available for install or update.

Ideally anyone pitching this project would be able to enumerate the required
features for core/plugin code to the point where it makes sense as a large
enough project, and we'd help tie the pieces together for anything beyond
the scope of the project for the purposes of actually implementing language
packs.

Being core material is not one of the requirements for a GSOC project.
 There are plenty of quality ideas that would work best as plugins or
themes (or with a sister project such as glotpress)


Bogumi?a - How do you intend to differentiate this from the other
survey and form options currently available?

Agreed. Having a really solid forms plugin in the that is coded up to 
core standards, is free, and doesn't create extra db tables is something 
I personally would be pretty psyched to see.

@Andrew: I will write the detailed proposal tomorrow.
Could you define me the scope of project for GSoC?
What functionalities will be proper for GSoC project?

I think that will be OK to make the automatic pot importer from plugin
repository to GP?
It could be also important to do modification in WP core for plugin
installation,
if some language pack is available on GP.
My experience in contribution to plugin WP Quick Deploy
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-quick-deploy/
for automatic plugin installation, will be very useful to achieve this goal.

@Stas: Thank you for suggestions.
What is your interest in this project?

Best Regards,
Marko

I'll give it a try.

Afaik profiles.wordpress.org now uses BuddyPress, so I will start by
proposing moving away from BuddyPress, all the ideas I will list below
will use only WordPress.

Engine
------

The biggest challenge for profiles/.org is how the profiles will be
updated. So far the shown data is mainly a result from fetching RSS
feeds from:
* support forums
* trac/core.svn
* trac/plugins.svn

Not much yet,
but it depends on the mentors interest for Courseware project I started
last year and apparently profiles.wordpress.org idea.

I'm just trying to find something, both useful and interesting.

Anyway, I wish you good luck with the application.
Make sure you checkout the GlotPress codebase before applying.

@Nacin, thanks for heads up, I didn't know.

There are other things attached to profiles, including extended profile 
fields, geo data, etc. that run on BuddyPress. We've also talked about 
using groups to facilitate some new working group and/or meetup stuff at 
some point.

Profile fields should not be a problem (I recently wrote a plugin that
converts all the xProfile fields data to user metadata, with one click).

What about groups... I think (I'm almost sure) I can use some custom
taxonomy to replace that. But I need more details, now I'm just
guessing.

I know I bugged this list last year about profiles/.org, so If the
core/.org team thinks it's not a top priority project this year, I will
stop asking about it and focus on something else.

I guess my question is why would we get rid of the BuddyPress plugin 
only to replace it with other plugins that don't have community 
development tied to core?

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=WrSTBkouncn52TQUbxt7NaGnWBEWNZZTvb9wg@mail.gmail.com>

Bit of topic sorry, but maybe you can help:

Does anyone know how to count the number of rows that would be returned in a
query, without giving the MySQL user SELECT privs?

Need to determine if a set email address is already in a database - if not,
add the address.

I have the security improved in that, currently, the MySQL user for this
application can only INSERT .. so worse-case sceniro, is a hacker can add
extra user data, but not view or remove any.

Now I need to count number of rows returned, but without any data actually
being returned.

Is there a command, or permission level I can use to do this? Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.

Nice question, a hard one.

I can understand the concerns, but right now the BuddyPress plugin does
only a small part of the job, new code will still have to be written,
templates will still have to be updated and the only win here will be
that I don't start from scratch, which in my case is not helping me
anyhow.
I also understand the part where .org projects should and are mainly
written by core community members, but I'm ready and eager to be
reviewed by any of them before deploying a single piece of code, and I'm
also ready to face the failure If I will not meet their expectations.

Let's take a look at current profiles/.org, the updates are stored as
activity streams, and though every stream can be of different kind, it
can't be tied to a taxonomy, so let's say If I want to generate a page
that shows latest @props from trac, I will have to hack BuddyPress,
while using post types and custom taxonomy it will be a snap.

Or suppose I want to add StackOverflow alike badges to profiles, which
will basically be taxonomies tied to updates, I don't know how to do
that on BuddyPress (actually I can just write some hooks that will add a
new badge if a certain activity type is met, which is not cool).

Or the karma part, the data will still be stored as user metadatas.

I don't see why I should carry the whole BuddyPress package just to use
it's activity streams, functionality that can be easily replaced and
work just on WordPress.

Full disclosure, I love BuddyPress, I write plugins for BuddyPress and I
know cases where it does all the job, but I'm also realistic.

Sorry, Somehow skipped the initial offtopic warning.. :)
Second thought might be to look into stored procedures, It appears that you
can have execute privs without select privs and rely on the SP to run the
select

Usermeta can be very tricky on wporg. Remember, we've got 2+ million
registered users here. Reproducing certain things can easily be done,
but the question is often if it's worth the trouble.

If you don't want to use BuddyPress activity streams, then there's no
reason to do so, and frankly I kind of agree with you. The way
profiles works with the streams now is somewhat slapdash. However,
it's better to leverage the existing BuddyPress for parts that are
needed instead of redeveloping them from scratch. It's better to fix
what needs fixing than to throw it away and start again.

And like Jane said, there's other plans for profiles. Things that we
want to add to it which come from existing features and capabilities
in other projects, like BuddyPress or bbPress or whatever. Writing it
from scratch using only-WordPress features is interesting and probably
more fun, but perhaps not the best use of available time or resources.
I mean, I can write a forum plugin that uses only custom post types
and custom taxonomies, or I can install bbPress. Which makes more
sense in terms of actually getting stuff done?

Well, bbPress is getting a rewrite :)

Anyway, I got the point, I won't be pushing it further.

So again, if we decide to go with BuddyPress (with which I'm
comfortable), does this project represent interest for the community as
a potential gsoc project (I would include the additional features you've
been planing or maybe other that can be discussed along)?

Thanks.

Hello Everyone,

I'm a senior undergraduate student wanting to apply for GSoC 2011. Frankly
speaking, I'm not a php developer, but I'm addicted to WordPress and
Android. I am very excited to find that there is an android project for
WordPress in GSoC 2011. As it is the first time for me to apply for it, I
feel a little puzzled and wish someone could help me. Waiting for reply. Thx
in advance.

P.S.This is my first mail in this list, sorry for any potential error(s).

Hello all,

     As per scribu's and jshreve's recommendations, I have broken up my 
proposal into two, separate proposals, as they thought the scope of my 
first proposal exceeded the time-frame of a GSoC project. Thinking of 
schedules for the new proposals I have come to realize they were most 
probably right and each one of these proposals would keep me busy for 
the summer.

Here are my new proposals:
*

* 
http://croncobaurul.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/gsoc-proposal-file-api-enhancements/

Feedback, is, as always, more than appreciated.

Thanks,

Mihai

Hello,

You will need to be a little more specific about what you're puzzled about.

Should i consider restricting myself to plug-in administration, theme
administration, user management  and widgets.

Leaving File manipulation would mean that no web like editor.

   possible in many cases like wordpress.com blogs , college blogs , etc
   2. local server to production server transfer is not possible in this
   case.
   3. It was not developed for WordPress 3.0 hence it is not concerned with
   networks in WordPress 3.0 or above


*My Proposed solution

*I propose a solution with 2 modes of Moving WordPress :-

1    For* local server to production server* transfer- A zipped backup will
be created and can be restored something similar to my plug-in (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/backup-and-move/). I need work more on
that plug-in make zip file creation more efficient

2     *Changing Host / Domain *:-  Plug-in is needed at destination with
some additional XML-RPC API's available at source. details :-

   - XML-RPC will be used to transfer file data to destination while media
   files can be transferred using cURL with file permission.
   - File management needs to be incorporated in xml-rpc
   - Database will be exported by xml-rpc API's with taking proper care of
   serialized PHP
   - Plug-in at destination will make necessary changes in setting files and
   database transfer to new host/domain

I know using xml-rpc will make out procedure comparatively slow. Hence we
can allow FTP options as well to speed up procedure for users who have
access to FTP details.

Procedure should be as smooth and robust as possible.*

Thx for scribu's reply and suggestion.

What I am puzzled is that what I need to do NOW and whether it's necessary
to contact potential mentor(s).

According to the "How to apply" section on
http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2011 , I have just complete the second step.
And the next step shows that I need to talk to potential mentors and then
post draft proposal on my blog. I have contacted with Jane Wells and she
told me to contact Dan Roundhill. I failed to find his email except his
website where I have leave a comment. Then I do not know what I should do
now. Thx for any advice.

You should make a draft of your proposal, put it on your blog and link to it
from here.

The purpose of contacting potential mentors is to get feedback on your
proposal(s).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Update Category Count after Bulk Delete
Message-ID: <AANLkTimtOxc2ChyuM-gOvt9pYbqSDhnxCQKVHyaW6_o2@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Guys,

I need to bulk delete about 4k posts from a site - all the posts are
assigned to a specific category.

Does anyone have any MYSQL snippets or pointers to something that will do
the job? I don't think WP Bulk Editing or any of the bulk delete plugins
will do the trick for such a large number of posts.

So far I can bulk delete the posts using something like:

*DELETE a,b,c,d FROM wp_term_relationships a
JOIN wp_term_taxonomy b ON b.term_taxonomy_id = a.term_taxonomy_id
JOIN wp_terms c ON c.term_id = b.term_id
JOIN wp_posts d ON d.id = a.object_id
WHERE c.name = 'Test Delete';*  --Category Name

But that still leaves the remaining category counts incorrect and comments
still in the system.

Thoughts? Help...?

Cheers
JC.

Sorry, Somehow skipped the initial offtopic warning.. :)
Second thought might be to look into stored procedures, It appears that

Hi, 
please consider also a not-so-common use I think should be covered by that plugin as well: in case of networked sites (multisite) can happen that a sub-site needs to be moved by a standalone WP install, maybe also with a new domain.

Here's a real world example: a news agency I work with have a networked website with a networked blog for each radio show. Now one of those radio shows needs to have its standalone domain name and its standalone website.

I can easily export or mangle database and solve this, but this is a real world case that isn't covered by any plugin, and if your approach will take care of it I think someone will enjoy this :-)

Just my thoughts, have a nice day.

Yes, i got your point. You want to move a single blog out of that network.
I think its doable. Since each blog create a different set of table of that
particular blog. Somehow i need to figure out details about file system.

I am waiting for a feedback from some core-developer whether i should pursue
this idea or not.

Subject: [wp-hackers] weird permalink issue
Message-ID: <AANLkTimFSdx1hrhichRk=NvH8njrZpwrRbOyo0gc2k5u@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I've just solved some hideous performance issues on a client's site
that turned out to be because of this:

http://ottopress.com/2010/category-in-permalinks-considered-harmful/

The permalink for posts was:

/%category%/news%/%postname%/

It's now:

/%year%/%category%/news/%postname%/

And things are much better :)

Apart from one item of weirdness. A particular URL:

http://www.integer-research.com/conferences/dec-brazil/2011/delegates/

Now redirects to:

http://www.integer-research.com/2010/fertilizers-chemicals/news/delegates-predict-world-cup-winner/

Actually, every /delegates/ page on every conference redirects there.

Now, that first URL isn't really a page. The system I've built
intercepts that 404 and serves up a dynamic template. I guess the
rewriting must be finding no page from the database and doing some
kind of leap of imagination to the post above.

The "fix" I've done for now is the change the slug for this "dynamic URL" to:

http://www.integer-research.com/conferences/dec-brazil/2011/the-delegates/

Works fine.

There are other "dynamic URL" pages that still work fine.

I guess I could create an actual page at that location, but the whole
point of these dynamic pages is that when the client creates a new
conference, some bits, like the delegates list, happen automatically -
it doesn't rely on them remembering to create them.

Just wondered if anyone else had had issues with clashes like this
with permalink structures, and if there's any other workarounds.

cheers,

Steve

I think this one would be a major selling point of the whole story. I can't think something nastier to do for an average WP user :-)

So, security lists are going to have a field day with this one, and I wanted to help this community  get ahead of it.

First see http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Mar/309?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter

and 

http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=BayvYdcP (the end of this link may be NSFW, depending on where you work).

A knee jerk reaction I'm seeing in channels is that it's WordPress' fault, it's easy to blame, but it may be more a case of a known 
exploit not being patched, I'm not aware of any SQL injection vulnerabilities in the past year though. 

Here's wishing them all luck, and a reminder to all of you to update your installs, including PHP/apache etc :).

This msg you posted was extremely uninformative.  It'd be nice to know 
up front that the 2 links you pointed us all at lead to pages that offer 
zero useful information, unless you want an iteration of databases 
installed at mysql.com and a link to some soft porn.

The implication you attempted to tie to this run of the mill hack job 
was that somehow it might lead to bad PR for WP. Got any useful info 
about that?

I think its funny that people, including Nacin yesterday :P, are just 
seeing this for the first time. I posted a notice about it to wp-hackers 
last week.  I think there is little risk of bad PR to WordPress out of 
this. Looking at the source code of the page that allowed the hack, I 
don't think it is a WP generated page, though it is possible to 
completely hide that these days. My guess would be that people just saw 
a WordPress multisite database in the list and started babbling.

The bigger risk is that one of us used a un/pw combo on mysql that they 
use everywhere else too.  That's another reason to use a unique pw on 
every site you log into.

I agree, this should be an included feature in a large official transfer 
project.  I've done it a number of times with home built php code for 
wp2.9 and also (what turned out to be just as easy) a simple mysql 
export and edit of the .sql.  So there is a need for it even if 98% of 
WordPress users wouldn't even understand what the option does.

OK, an update to this. It seems that my "dynamic pages" system is
being scuppered any time the URL contains a slug that appears anywhere
in a real page or post elsewhere on the site. WP just redirects to the
real page or post.

My stuff is happening on the init hook - this code is being processed
on these requests. I do stuff like changing the HTTP headers to 200
later, in template_redirect - this code doesn't get processed.

Presumably WP's rewriting / redirecting happens in between. What's the
easiest way, in the init hook, to say to WP: "don't bother with the
redirecting on this one"?

I know there's probably better ways of doing what I'm doing, but (1)
it's been working so far, and (2) if WP is stepping in and not finding
a real page for the request, shouldn't it be giving a 404? I guess
it's some interference between my code and WP. Anyway, any ideas about
halting WP's actions would be great. I'm hammering through the hooks
now...

cheers,

Steve

I think a limit to plug-in administration, theme administration, and user
administration would be an easy way to tighten things up.  Widget management
I see as a part of theme administration.

You did a great job with the child theme, wanted to mention also this plugin
has an implementation of the meta below the title

If you take a look at the TwentyTen CRM theme (

post editor inside a meta box (Notes), so it can then be rearranged like any
other meta box.

In the functions.php file around line 247 you'll find "Begin moving post

Mark,
 See Brian Layman's message, basically the list of tables and databases mention WordPress specifically, even though I'm fairly certain that WP was not the way in. 
The point of the two links was to let people see the information that's public and be able to talk about it coherently as opposed to saying "wha? I dunno what you're talking about".

The first link actually lists the page where they got in from, one could view the source from there and determine it's not a WordPress generated page. 

I didn't want to (hopefully) preach to the choir about what they should be doing once they found out a site they may have a login on was compromised, etc as well.

I thought I'd tracked this down to wp_old_slug_redirect, because the
redirect occurring seems to be a 301 - and this is the only 301
redirect I can find in the core.

However, this function just returns when it guesses that it's a page
being requested, and it doesn't deal with hierarchical post types.

I'm stuck. Anyone?

cheers,

Steve

hi all,

my website have custom post type and custom taxonomy.

I've a page which display all the custom post type associate to a custom
taxonomy, I use for that the template taxonomy-my_taxonomy.php

is it possible to use the order attribut to order post in this page?

or I would like to display the older post first, currently it's the newer
posts which come first.

thank you for your help,

finaly I found how to do:

$args = array(

   'order' => 'asc'
);

query_posts(array_merge( $wp_query->query,$args ));

before I try but I didn't use array_merge...

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Project Feedback - File Uploader
Message-ID: <AANLkTin+sMh6hOXAG4RCVStYVEVi=gWWMaNHreNnNs2F@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all...

I'm currently working on my GSoC application and will have it posted to my
blog soon, but I wanted to get some preliminary feedback.

I'm interested in working on the file uploader - getting a more
feature-filled uploader that can work with HTML5, drag-and-drop, etc. based
on browser support.

I've done some research on file uploading for some of my past personal
projects, and these are a few of the existing open source projects I know
of, ranked roughly from most promising to least promising

   1. Plupload - http://www.plupload.com/
   2. Uploadify - http://www.uploadify.com/
   3. Ajax Upload jQuery Plugin - http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
   4. jQuery File Upload - http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload
   5. Some combination of swfupload (
   https://github.com/alexanmtz/jqswfupload,
   https://github.com/ifunk/swfupload-jquery-plugin)

Are there any other file uploaders that I'm missing that would be good for
consideration?

The task of choosing an uploader and integrating while keeping existing APIs
seems fairly straightforward - are there any potential challenges that I am
missing?

Thank you for your feedback,
Jacob

How does it do that?

If you're hooking into the 404.php template or something, then you're
basically doing it last, which is the wrong way to do it. The
redirect_canonical function which is hooked into template_redirect
will run first, probably going around your 404 logic and serving up
the redirect before your code runs.

Instead, hook your URL detection code into template_redirect with a
higher priority, so as to run before any of the other template stuff
takes effect. Then you can do your output and exit; before any of the
normal template stuff runs.

I use the WPlupload plugin. It's awesome, works great. Highly recommend it.

Unfortunately, this plugin achieves it's aim by hacking core code which is a
*really* bad thing to do.

The twentyten-crm theme uses jquery to move the editor div inside a normal
meta box; a much better approach IMHO.

Before doing bulk import/deletes, just call:

wp_defer_term_counting( true )

And after your import is finished, call

wp_defer_term_counting( false )

That will catch up your term and category counts after the delete. For the
comments, I think you have to add another JOIN to your SQL to catch all the
comments on the posts you're deleting.

To be honest, I think all this stuff should have hooks - indeed, all
the default admin stuff should be hookable in my view!

Thanks Otto, you're the man. I've just removed redirect_canonical
function from that hook when I detect a URL corresponding to one of my
dynamic pages. All seems good now :)

uploader.  Neat to see drag-and-drop working, too.

Still hackish though... There should be a core way to do this. I've the 
same requirement for an upcoming project and had to work around it.  We 
should put together a trac ticket for this...

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2011
Message-ID: <loom.20110330T194719-969@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

I am interested in participating in GSoC. I know I am rather late, in 8 days we 
have to file the proposal but I would still like to try. I've been looking at 
the WP ideas page and I like two ideas. 

One is working around Media. Me personally I see myself working more on the 
backend then on the frontend, although I guess this is open for discussion :-) 
I've been looking at the architecture of WP, reading what I could find, and I 
think media can still be improved. The other one is the moving of WP to another 
server/domain. I know right now its possible to export the blog, but like the 
idea mentions it can still be simplified a lot. 

As far as the media idea goes, I don't think the WP core needs more gallery 
features and stuff like that, at least not now. I think a stronger backend is 
needed, providing a very strong foundation to build some management 
functionality on. This is all that should be added to the core. The current 
frontend features such as galleries could be kept for now. Any other features 
could then be implemented using plugins. 

To clarify this a little bit. I see one central storage point in the WP core for 
all media. This would for instance mean a basic table in the DB, with a record 
for each media item. The files would still be stored on disk, although sub 
folders should best be supported to keep things manageable. Using a table like 
that, would mean that files can be moved around without breaking things higher 
up. Some form of taxonomization should be supported, be it using categories, 
tags, posts, etc. This would than allow, together with some extra meta data, to 
provide more enhanced searching, filtering and sorting in the Admin area. 

I am aware that this sounds like a heavy proposal, but in fact the goal would be 
to keep things light and fast, assuming that more advanced functionality is 
built on top using plugins. If anything the design should be future proof, so 
future extensions don't break so much the existing code. 

The time would thus be spend on getting to know the core better, classifying 
current and future requirements for the new core, designing a solution that 
fits, and then implementing it. 
The implementation will require a several weeks, depending on how much of the 
user interface is changed to make use of the new core right away. The start, the 
getting to know the core better as well as the classifying requirements would 
happen in parallel. The same amount of time or more would be needed, spending at 
least 3 weeks here. The design would then happen in between. So about 40% phase 
one, 25% phase two, and 35% phase three. 

I haven't given the other idea about moving/changing domain name of the blog 
that much thought. I can see how it can be made better from a users point of 
view, but am not quite sure yet how this should be realized technically. In case 
my other proposal doesn't fit at all in the roadmap set out for WP, I will look 
some more into this idea. 

Thank you for your time. Looking forward to receiving some feedback on this 
idea. 

Regards,

Thomas Van Eyck

This is already the case: each file has a record in the wp_posts table, with
the 'attachment' post type.

You should do your homework better next time. ;)

Message-ID: <AANLkTimVV_Ke5ZUxci59FChGOMqk4ubSYsji37GgV2ju@mail.gmail.com>

I'm preparing a GSoC application for a plugin that implements document
management and version control functionality.

The idea would be to help position WordPress to make some headway into
gov/enterprise where these features are often required. It would also help
approach parity with other open source CMS's as well as Sharepoint when it
comes to document management.

Specifically:

 - Extend WP's revisions and attachment functionality to handle revisions to
attachments, including a revision log (similar to commit messages) for
documents, grouping documents and their revisions into a custom post type
object.

 - Build on permalink structure and post statuses to handle latest-document
and revision permalinks, and public/private toggling functionality.

 - Build onto the existing autosave system to maintain file locks to prevent
collisions.

 - Add basic workflow management (overview of documents by status, etc.)
upon which other plugins and users could expand.

- Apply user permissions on a document-status level.

I've been working on a prototype that supports the beginnings of these
features, but it's very much a work in progress. Thoughts or feedback with
regards to the idea and scope would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Ben Balter

Subject: [wp-hackers] Zen-Coding for WordPress?
Message-ID: <4D93A125.8070309@philipwalton.com>

Is anyone aware of a plugin or theme framework that implements some 
version of zen-coding not within a text editor but actually as a set of 
php methods or functions?

If not I'd be willing to start working on something, and I wanted to 
float the idea out there to gauge the general interest level and/or see 
if anyone wants to get involved.

Basically, I'm wanting to be able to do something like this within 
WordPress themes and/or functions instead of writing a million 
hard-to-read echo statements.

$zc = new Zen_Coder;
$zc->expand( "#sidebar>.wrapper>ul.widget>li.item$*3>a", array( 
$link1_data, $link2_data, $link3_data) );

Feedback welcome.

Sort of confused. At first I thought this was a typo and you were referring to using the Zend Framework. But found Zen Coding http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/

From what I can tell this is more a module for your coding environment like Coda, Textmate, Eclipse, Visual Studio. Not something that runs on a server and therefore directly integrated with WordPress to parse the PHP at the time the page is requested. Unless I'm missing something.

Ha! I just transferred a load of code from a Zend Framework made site
engine to Wordpress and now I know how they did their ultra
complicated and neat code without tears!

I'd be interested to see this implemented.

Paul, yes, It is a module for a text editor, but I think it would also 
be useful programmatically. To use the example from the link you posted:

div#page>div.logo+ul#navigation>li*5>a

In a text editor I would type this, click whatever shortcut key, and 
then the editor would expand the code into the full HTML markup saving 
me lots of time.

In addition to this, I could also see situations where you wouldn't know 
what your markup is going to look like until runtime (perhaps it is 
generated based on plugin settings), and being able to programmatically 
create that string selector -- and then have a set of methods that could 
expand it -- would be quite valuable.

Imagine if the above code instead looked like this:

$selector = 'div#' . $sidebar_id . '>div.' . $logo_class . '+ul#navigation>li*' . $link_count . '>a';

I know I'd use such code, and if there's nothing already out there 
specifically for WordPress -- that takes advantage of esc_attr() and 
esc_url() and such -- I'd be willing to make it myself.

The problem is that the entire zen-coding core is written in
Javascript, not in PHP. So unless you want to create a JS->PHP
converter or tie in a Javascript interpreter of some sort, there's no
way to process this sort of thing server-side.

Otto, I'm mainly planning on duplicating functionality, not trying to 
tap into their existing code. And, I'm not planning on implementing 
every single feature of the specification, since many of them don't make 
sense in PHP.

Also, there needs to be a way to pass content since, in the text-editor 
version, the content is manually typed in.

I've already got some ideas that are working pretty well, and I'll post 
a demonstration when I'm finished.

Well I never said there wasn't any table in the current implementation :-) 
Besides that table is depending on what you expect in the feature part of the 
problem, at least from a database design point of view. 

For starters, there is a lot more to say about a media file than just what the 
table says now, and no point in filtering/sorting metadata that isn't there to 
begin with. Even with the wp_postmeta table, it looks even more forced in. I 
assume the entire media support was added this way to benefit from the comments 
support throughout the rest of the code. Furthermore, the other mentioned 
features are missing or incomplete. The DB part is one thing, the API to manage 
it is another.

There already is a wealth of metadata stored in wp_postmeta (including EXIF
information), but it's crammed under a single key: wp_attachment_metadata.

Besides that, there's nothing inherently limiting about the current schema.

No, it was done this way precisely to benefit from the API you think is
missing: get_posts(), add_post_meta(), register_taxonomy() etc. etc.

This seems like a GREAT idea to me.  My questions are:

How do you intend to fit this in the allocated timeline?  This seems
like an awfully large project to do in a single summer when the goal
is to have a working prototype by mid-term and spending the second
half polishing.  What sort of timeframe are you thinking?

How do you intend to enforce user permissions on files?  Will you
force users to edit there server configuration (.htaccess for shared
servers) or do you have another idea for preventing directly getting
the files?

Do you intend for this to be completely backend based, or will there
be front end components?

I do think this is a great idea that has alot of potential.

Hi Ben,

This sounds like very valuable addition albeit I think the scope is 10x the size that can reasonable get done by a GSoC developer.

I could see breaking each one of your points down into a project by itself and I especially like the idea of a workflow management system.

I'd also like to know is what experience have you had that have give you insight into real world use-cases? I think for this to be done well it would need to address many different real-world use-cases from real like users which might not be possible in the abstract vacuum of a GSoC project?

And where is your blog post as a proposal as I'd like to read more?

-Mike

Mike - These are student projects, intended as learning and mentorship 
opportunites within the open source project. The majority don't wind up 
in core or being what they were imagined to be during the application 
phase. Let's not attempt to put the same burden you would place on 
someone applying for a contract development job on the teenage and 
early-20s students who make up the majority of GSoC applicants. The 
project mentors are the ones providing the real-world experience as they 
work with the students during the warm-up period to revise scope as 
needed. That's kind of the whole point of pairing up students and 
mentors in GSoC.

Ben - I love the doc management idea. Check out the EditFlow plugin for

Performance and maintainability being the most important. As this is extended, 
its much more likely to break. Besides, designs like this are never inherently 
limiting. Its one giant string. 

Also, lets agree that NextGen gallery is a good example of some of the 
functionality user want. I don't understand than why they don't use this 
limitless schema ;) From a users point of view that btw adds up to the 
confusion. As a new WP user you add some media, make a gallery. You reach the 
limits of the built in system, so you add a plugin, only to discover that all of 
you previous work adding metadata was in fact pointless. No shared backend 
between these plugins, not even for the very basics.

Post != media. It explains why it always feels like sthg is missing when working 
with media in wordpress. I never said just missing, I said missing or 
incomplete. And yes I have not studied this entire api back and forth, but I 
have checked a few things on my list and there is no real way to do this from 
the core.

NextGen is no panacea regarding its database schema.  Just look at the sortorder field in wp_ngg_album.

> Post != media.

But post==element_of_content.  Creating another table to storing attachments in another location is not the solution.  Adding metadata might be.

FWIW.

If done without a good understanding of use-cases then it could be done poorly and then my fear would be it could become used widely (like NextGen is) but do a poor job of addressing important use cases and thus act like a blocker for those use-cases (again, like NextGen, although NextGen could easily fix the problems I've seen that it has.)

I guess my point of asking for experience is to shine a light on the need for lots of experience for a project of that magnitude. If he instead takes on just one component of his proposal then I think he might be able to do a great job.

Agreed, and my intention was not to say that it is. My point is that to 
implement this kind of functionality the current schema doesn't suffice. Not 
even as a basis, extended with some tables, which I think it should. Saying that 
its not bad, doesn't make it good, and it doesn't mean that there is no room for 
improvement. 

Other plugins are often similar. I think its at least worth checking out their 
db schema, and seeing why they don't use the core one. The effect described 
before is really annoying for the user and does not really make sense.

I don't know the exact best solution. Adding metadata to the posts table isn't I 
think. Perhaps extending the metadata table is. Depends on how much you want to 
keep in the core. And what do you mean to say with post == element_of_content? 
Not that its not true, I don't see how it helps in itself.

Adding or modifying tables in WordPress is a HUGE consideration with many ramifications.  The only time when that changes gets considered is when all other options are exhausted.  

Even if it might be better in the abstract, the weight of making changes and the consideration of plugins and themes that might have used SQL to interact with them means that table changes are a last resort, as it should be.

Meaning that the wp_posts table is where content goes.  Media is a type of content thus it should go in the wp_posts table.  This is how Drupal works too (they call theirs a "node" table) and so I think this is a design pattern that works best for content management systems.

If you want to add tables, you're going to need to make a very
compelling reason.  Remember, on a MS install, you need add tables for
every site.

I think you are underestimating the flexibility that the posts /
postmeta table system allows.   Also, the posts table is really only
named that way for legacy reasons and the fact that changing it now
would break more things then changing it is worth (after all, a rose
by any other name....).  It's better to think of it as the content
table.

As far as I know, NextGen wasn't built and designed with feedback from
core community members, so it's kind of comparing apples to pears.
I'm sure the mentors will make sure that this is as flexible as
possible so that you and others can adopt it to specific use cases.

Our measure of success with our participation in GSoC is in growing 
long-term core contributors, not necessarily the 'success' of a 
particular bit of code. We learn just as much form the things that go 
wrong as we do from the things that go right. GSoC is a learning 
experience above all.

> So my concern with his proposal was that it would be incredibly valuable, probably the best I've seen, but only if done right.
The core developers of WordPress, the people who make up the mentorship 
group, are the people best able to judge if something is done "right" 
according to our coding standards.

> Frankly, I have clients who want some of the exact things his proposal specified.
Then you should built it yourself or hire someone to do it, not try to 
get a student who's hoping to take advantage of a mentorship opportunity 
with completely different goals to do it for you. Come on, man. This is 
going too far and crossing a line.

> Further my belief is that no one single mentor, myself included, could offer him enough experience to do a good job on the entirety of his proposal; its scope is just too large.
All projects will have two mentors plus additional backup mentors. 
Please try not to insult the experience of a lot of people who are 
volunteering their time, many of whom you don't even know, in pursuit of 
your own agenda.

> I guess my point of asking for experience is to shine a light on the need for lots of experience for a project of that magnitude.
It just isn't really the place of this list to grill students about 
their experience. They will include their experience in their 
application, where it will be reviewed by the mentors. The purpose of 
posting to this list is to get feedback on the ideas and code 
approaches. Posting to wp-hackers is not a job interview.

You're underestimating it. Reading through your first post, there's
very little that you're proposing which isn't actually rather, well,
slightly-above-trivial to do. Okay, so much of it isn't there by
default, but extending the media system is pretty easy, actually.

Have you looked at Matt's Gallery page? The naming system? The people
tagging? The sometimes rather excessive EXIF data it's showing? See
http://ma.tt/gallery and http://ma.tt/person/veronica-belmont/ and
http://ma.tt/2010/12/paris-walk-and-dinner/mcm_6127/#image-meta for
examples.

All that is done with the core functionality, some template stuff, and
a plugin for the custom people taxonomy.

Adding extra metadata to attachments that you need for database query
functions (like let's say you want to sort on, ohh, Aperture size from
the EXIF data), is rather trivial. Off the top of my head, I'd hook a
function to "wp_update_attachment_metadata" which got the data I
wanted out of the metadata array (in this case, the aperture info) and
then did an update_post_meta to add a custom metadata of my own
choosing (_wp_image_aperture) to the postmeta for the given attachment
post. Querying on it then becomes a simple matter of query_posts with
meta_key set to my field, and order set to meta_value or
meta_value_num. Total would be about 10 lines of code, more if I
wanted to make it entirely generic (which would be rather a lot of
postmeta data, considering... better to only store separately that
which you wanted to sort on or use separately in some fashion).

The media system and its method of storing files is actually quite
robust. Could it be simpler and smaller with a separate table?
Probably. Would it be as capable or robust? Not really. There's
virtually no gain there and you end up adding a ton of extra code for
no benefits.

You mention "moving files around without breaking things", and while
that is a laudable goal, it's one that really is not beneficial to
most users and actively harmful to others. WordPress is really
designed with speed in mind, and most webservers are lightning fast at
serving static content, like images. Adding more table lookups and
such just to get the current location of the image isn't particularly
useful. The specific case of "moving things around" on the server is
not one of those things that 80% of users do. That's power-user
functionality. Most users upload their images and are satisfied that
it appears on the webpage. You rarely need any more than that. Heck, a
surprising number of users upload multiple copies of the same images
several times instead of using the gallery to choose the same image
again.

It's true that there's significant room for improvement on the admin
side of things, however this is entirely a User Interface issue, not a
design issue. The media handling system is extremely capable and
highly flexible already. It's really just the view of it that needs
some work.

Jane, it's amazing how you take what I say, envision diabolical intent and then twist it to sounds like nothing I intended. It's as if you look for opportunities to do so.  The only "agenda" I have is to see the CMS use-case improve. Your assertions are insulting and if you've seen the work I've done for clients that rarely uses anyone else's code other than core you'd know your assertions are baseless. It is you that crosses the line by insinuating these things without a shred of actual evidence. Clearly you discount all the things I have do for free[1] to help those who use WordPress professionally, and you damage me by insinuating that I'm pursuing an anti-WordPress agenda.

I don't know what I specifically did to you or when I did it such that you come out attacking every time I tried to contribute here but whatever it is I apologize. Life's too short.

I'd just like to plug my own Media-Tags plugin as an example of extending the Media system.

I reply here both to Mike and Aaron. I will read through Otto's comments
and
answer shortly. I wrote this while he responded :-)

Thank you everyone for the feedback.

This discussion is getting of track. The do's and dont's of DB design are
important, but not the key topic of the discussion. It has been interesting
though :-)

Adding tables breaks things, or requires a transition period to give others
the
time to adjust their code. It is not in any case my intention to deny this.
Although that doesn't mean it cannot be done, and couldn't lead to
improvements
in the end. Legacy is a sthg we need to deal with, and it drives many of
the
design decisions.

My original proposal was not based on my extensive knowledge of WP, but on
my
experience as a user. For me media support is there, but it doesn't quite
work
the way I would expect it too. It doesn't let me do what I want. I would
like to
help change that. With or without GSoC for that matter.

As said in the very beginning, I know im quite late with this proposal, so
perhaps my homework isn't done perfectly no. Since the general consensus
seems
to be that the core should remain light, I didn't propose to add a new
gallery
type or sthg to WP. From what I have read about features other users were
requesting in the ideas pages, I came to a first conclusion based on what I
know, that the core should be made more powerful.

My proposal pictured a final result, sthg like 'the perfect solution', which
is
off course not always the most realistic one. If a more thorough study
would
reveal that indeed the current tables are flexible enough to implement the
needed features, then I will be the last one to force a new one in there
just
for fun. I can live with the downsides of the current design, if it means
not
breaking everything. The discussion whether or not this design is the best
one
should take place when the tables are actually going to be changed, not yet
now.
If the tables are not sufficient, then adding new ones should be open for
discussion and it shouldn't be thrown away just because of legacy. There is
always a solution.

Instead of trying to formulate a proposal myself, maybe its better to just
ask
the question and see. I want to work on media, since I think it needs
improvement and it would give me the greatest satisfaction working on that.
Can
I help by doing sthg useful?

Thomas

I think if you're wanting to improve the media system, that's perfect
for a gsoc project, but perhaps you should focus more on the interface
and the end goals instead of how you're wanting to get there from
here.

The media handling system is quite robust, but it's the interface that
people really see. If you had some good goals for what you want people
to see, or how an organization system should work from the user's
perspective, then you'd have a good project.

It's also important to recognize that the system isn't "legacy", as
such. Attachments are stored in the posts table for a reason. That's a
design feature, not a legacy architecture. The DB design has evolved
over time to be highly fast and flexible. There's lots and lots (and
friggin' lots) of code dealing with it in specific ways, and generally
speaking you can fit pretty much anything you want into it. It's just
a matter of rethinking. And I say this as somebody who has had to
force myself to unlearn "third normal form" in learning scalable
web-database programming. ;)

So focus more on that end result. Maybe think about some mockup
screens, or what sort of functionality in the interface would be
useful to organize media. Heck, just adding an organization system for
media would be a big project all by itself.

Mike,

First-off, let me say thank you for your contributions by sharing your
WordPress knowledge with the community on StackExchange - we need more
people who are willing like you to provide your knowledge of WordPress for
free to those of us who can benefit.

Second, I just wanted to let you know that, from my point of view, I don't
see Jane's comments as in any way insinuating that you have diabolical
intent or possess an anti-WordPress agenda.  On the contrary, you seem to
have a genuine desire to see this project in core "done right."  After all,
as you have said, you have seen a real life need for this kind of thing in
your client work.

However, what it seems that Jane is trying to say is that in GSoC, while the
code quality is important, the learning process is the goal.  GSoC provides
students the opportunity to present a project idea, be mentored while
completing that project, and in the process learning much about project
management, coding, and in general working in the open source ecosystem.

True - design and code are important, but hey, the students get to work with
some of the core devs.  So then, the core goal of GSoC is learning.  That's
what I got from what Jane said.

It looks like you both agree that building the complete perfected
document/revision manager is probably outside the scope of what can be done
over a summer (or maybe Benjamin's a guy who codes gold 24/7, awake and
asleep), but this is open source, so the beauty of it is that others will
come along and contribute.

I'm sure that Benjamin would love to hear any specific challenges that you
have faced attempting to implement this feature for your client sites.

But, this is all just my opinion... just mainly wanted to let you know that
I don't view Jane's comments as personal attacks on yourself at all, but
only trying to clarify GSoC's purpose.


Benjamin, this sounds like a pretty sweet idea!  If I was going to pick one
of the items on the list to see done, I'd probably pick the first one
(extending
WP's revisions and attachment functionality to handle revisions to attachments)
- it would be really nice to see the whole post/attachment revisions model
become unified.  That's just me, though.

Sorry guys, got two wires crossed there. Anyway, I appreciate the insights
so far, and I'll look to more clearly define the scope as I continue to
prepare my application.

Subject: [wp-hackers] numeric slugs redux
Message-ID: <AANLkTikqRz=Bpar6Gv-JtT230p0jJVXxAYinDeVvcAaL@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

There's a site for a major client, I built it a few years ago with
WordPress. They have a lot of conferences, and I based a lot of the
custom stuff on each year's conference having a page with the slug
being the year.

Last year, 3.0 broke the site. This is the ticket:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14238

I've had to hack the core (ew!) to keep the site working.

I've just fixed some terrible performance issues which were related to
the problem that Otto let everyone know about last year
(http://ottopress.com/2010/category-in-permalinks-considered-harmful/)
wherein categories at the start of permalinks is a no-no. I've changed
things so the year is at the start of the permalink.

Now, I've also upgraded to 3.1. I'm not sure if the new problem is
related to the year in the permalink or to 3.1. Anyway, the issue is
that any request to a conference landing page returns the content for
the parent page. For example this URL:

http://example.com/conferences/brazil/2011/

Will return the content for:

http://example.com/conferences/brazil/

This URL will return the content as normal:

http://example.com/conferences/brazil/2011/sub-page/

Obviously it's hitting a rewrite rule that's interferring. I'm not
very knowledgeable about the rewrites system, but poking around I
found a place where I could hook in and hack it. Here's what I've got:

add_action( 'parse_request', 'slt_parse_request' );
function slt_parse_request( $request ) {
	$pagename_parts = explode( '/', $request->query_vars['pagename'] );
	if ( $pagename_parts[0] == 'conferences' && preg_match(
'#/[0-9]{4,4}#', $request->query_vars['page'] ) ) {
		$request->query_vars['pagename'] .= $request->query_vars['page'];
		$request->query_vars['page'] = '';
	}
}

At some point the numeric slug at the end is being split off from the
request URI and placed in the 'page' request var.

So, some questions:

- Does anyone know if the above hack might cause others problems along the line?

- What's the difference between 'page' and 'pagename' in the query
vars? Might I be better off understanding the rewrites and adjusting
the rules?

- Are there any plans to properly address the issues with numeric
slugs in WP? I don't want to be spending time with every WP release
hacking this site to work properly. In the long run, am I looking at
having to recode the whole site to work without numeric slugs?

Many thanks for any input on this, it's causing a deal of stress for
the client and myself...

cheers,

Steve

Hi Victor. Your proposal needs to be much more specific. You are meant 
to identify exactly what you want to build, not have an open-ended 
'discuss problems and decide' section of the schedule. Can you revise 
your proposal with more specifics?
Thanks,

I think this is a fantastic idea, mostly because existing document
management systems are so lacking in features and control.

I'm concerned a bit about managing document revisions with the WordPress
revisioning system.  The first time I read your description, I was guessing
you meant a user would be able to view some sort of diff between document
revisions within WordPress itself.  Considering the sheer number of document
formats in use, it seems almost impossible to have this kind of rich
functionality (so correct me if you've already got one working).  As I
thought about it more, I came to think you might just have different
versions of an attachment hooked to different revisions within WordPress,
thus keeping a full history of changes.  My concern here is storing the
files.  A heavily-modified document could have several versions of itself
with only minor changes living on the server.

So ... basically I'm asking for more detail about *how* you want to extend
the revision and attachment functionality to handle attachment revisions.
 It's an impressive concept, and one I'd like to see more fleshed out.

Other than that, I think this is a fantastic idea and I look forward to
seeing a more complete GSoC application from you!

I don't know if you saw this, but github did a great job with their diff
tool:

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=XAxXu7FCEs-5GA7J1sULyJCfpp21upa_zTGio@mail.gmail.com>

hello

on site which i create now, i will have many areas with photos and
those photos must be rescaled befor displaying. normally to do this i
use phpThumb with ?w=100&h=200 etc.

Is there any other way to do this using wordpress core functions?

I thought to use  add_image_size to automatically rescale image when
is uploaded. but if i choose this way, i am affraid that this will not
work. i should register tens of image sizes. when smb will upload
photo i can expect that when wordpress will save this image with
rescaled many variants in one moment php will exceed memory limit.

is there any function which i can use in way like phpThumb? this
should rescale image (with crop option) but before this check if
already rescaled version exists

Check out the functions in the following files:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.1/wp-admin/includes/image.php
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.1/wp-includes/media.php
*
*
*Lots of functions in there that you can probably use. One of the best
functions is `image_make_intermediate_size`.*

Yes. A number at the end of a URL is considered to be a page number, not a
separate page. Basically, WordPress does not support all numeric slugs well.

Probably will, yes. It's something that you'll have to keep up to date,
basically. You might be better off using a known and supported plugin:

Page is the page number. Like Page 1, page 2, etc. If you use
<!--nextpage--> in the post to split it up into pages, then the URLs will be
like example.com/slug/1 and example.com/slug/2 and so on. Your year as the
slug is being interpreted as page 2011 of the brazil page.

Using add_image_size is indeed the correct way to go, but the real question
is why would you need "tens" of image sizes? Are you really displaying the
same image in ten different places, ten different sizes?

If some of these sizes are similar or close enough together, then you can
use a combination of image resizing and browser resizing. Let's say I only
have it generate three image sizes normally. Then I try to display an image,
but instead of passing it a size, I pass it an array(width,height). This
works, but what it does internally is that it looks at what image sizes it
has, grabs the one that's closest (but bigger), does the scaling math, and
then pops back an IMG tag with the width and height set correctly, but using
that slightly larger image. This makes the browser itself scale the image
down, giving me the best approximation and not requiring me to do all the
server resizing and such.

Realistically, you're not going to run out of execution time with "tens" of
image sizes though. It can generally handle it just fine. I've gone up to
six for a site with no significant problems. Resizing isn't a slow
operation, it's just heavy on temporary memory usage.

the answer is: customer needs this :)

not at all. in most of cases images uploaded to medi library will be
displayed in two sizes: 'large' and 'thumbnail'

but customer want  to use those images from library also in other
custom post types, in widgets, in jquery-cycle etc.
please look at this prototype of main page:
http://awesomescreenshot.com/08eak5t82 all full color images which you
see, owner of the site will choose from already uploaded to media
library
now i counted that one image could be displayed in at least 9 sizes.
but most of images (i think 95%) will be displayed only in custom post
type 'gallery' in only two sizes mentioned above.

generating 9 image sizes during the image upload process (in
situation, when only two sizes will be displayed  for sure, and next 7
maybe) will be unefficient for server

doing this in way which you described is also not a good way: my
customer is pedant and always see when i just rescale image in
width="" hieght="" html parameters (this changes dimensions) :) i
tried this and this doesnt work

i just wanted to find way to move rescale process from upload action
to  the moment when special size is really neccesary and plugin
mentioned by Scribu is perfect

Hello folks

I am planning to send in my draft proposal for GSoC 2011 for the
project "Refresh the Android App UI". Before doing so, I would like to
get the feedback of the community on this, so that I can make some
modification to the mock-up that I have prepared.

You can find the sample UI mock-up here.

http://anirudhspider.wordpress.com/2011/03/31/suggestion-for-new-wordpress-android-app-ui/

Suggestions/comments welcome.

Thank you.

Cheers
Anirudh

I think it is really doable. Either i am a workaholic or something :-/
Yes i think i should start working on xml-rpc and UI design right away. Any
start up tips ? I am familiar with plug-in development

For the XML-RPC stuff, start with documentation.  Explain what parameters
each call received and what data each sends back.  Then, working from a
detailed description, figure out what functions you'll need to call in WP to
make it work.  Basically ... Documentation => Logical Flow Diagram =>
Prototype.  Starting with the documentation gives you a solid foundation
when you start coding, and means you won't need to re-do it afterwards.

With the UI, build a paper prototype (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping) to explain how it works and
run it by a few people.  Then put together an actual mockup.  It's easier to
change the location of a button when it's drawn on paper than when it's a
multi-layer Photoshop graphic :-)  I'm speaking from experience on that one
...

 microsurveys and surveys editor with statistics.
Message-ID: <4D94E8CF.5040208@inventcore.net>

I have verified several solutions to make forms and surveys and I found 
out that:
* forms are always send to e-mail - why don't to database or xml?
* no statistics and analysing options
* not many predefinied templates (mainly contact forms) - why not 
microsurveys templates like: yes/no, like/don't like,  agree/disagree, 
and other.
* no option to add image to forms
* nonintuitive, too many rarely used options

Many avaliable plugins are not maintained and noncompatible with current 
WordPress version.

Automattic's own Grunion Contact
Form<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/>plugin
also stores them as a custom post type, which is neat.

Hello Jane,

I'm very glad to receive your feedback.

Do you mean that I should have some sketch model of the new UI? If so, I
will finish it as soon as I can.

I think the refresh will not be limited to a dashboard type home screen but
the whole app so as to bring more convenient UE.

Firstly, the dashboard type home screen tends to be alike especially the
Evernote for Android as I have mentioned. Sencondly, I  think the final
result should judged more by others' opinion but not by me independently.
Last but not least, I assigned the design work as pre-preparation which I
will finish before the real begin of GSoC (May 23). All above are the
reasons I do not give a sketch model of an dashboard type home screen.

Best Wishes!

Yours Sincerely,
