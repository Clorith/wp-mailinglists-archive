Subject: [wp-hackers] new post status : ban (/deleted)
Message-ID: <59e7f3130809020527r3966065ala5d565148aedddbf@mail.gmail.com>

Since there is a validation process now, what is the proper status for
a "submitted for review" post when the editor does not want to publish
the post ?
"draft" ... "pending" .... editor want to publish = "publish"... do
not want = "???"

Of course posts can be deleted. But keeping banished posts in database
can be useful for further references and cross checking.

What do you think ? Should I keep my idea to myself and hack a new
status into the database (I do need this status), or is the idea worth
of submitting ?

I don't really have an opinion on this but there should be a better word
than 'banished', perhaps 'returned for review'. The meaning of 'ban'
could be easily confused.

"rebuked" maybe ? :)

Could be "disapproved"... in French, we'd simply say "refus?" ("denied" ?)

I guess the support forum won't be of any help here
( http://wordpress.org/support/topic/200944?replies=1 )

I have a plugin page ...
/wp-admin/admin.php?page=plugin.php

in plugin.php :
$title = __('My plugin page','plugin');
$parent_file = 'plugin.php';
wp_enqueue_script('admin-forms');
require_once('admin-header.php');

And still got no forms.js loading in the header...
should be this one, like in edit.php :
<script type='text/javascript'
src='http://www.mydomain.com/wp-admin/js/forms.js?ver=20080401'></script>

anyone got a clue why ?

I'd probably go with denied, but the real point here is that this COULD 
be useful to a lot of people.  Why don't you open a ticket for it and 
post the link to that here.  Everyone can weigh in on the ticket, which 
keeps everything in one place.  Then you can add the patch to that 
ticket once you are ready, using the preferred language decided on.

Yes. You have to run wp_enqueue_script() from an action that fires 
before the scripts are printed in the head.
Right now, you're attempting to queue the script from about midway 
through the content pane being rendered.

I noticed http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/8728 and
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/8749 the other day. It occurred to
me that since this is a fix for a security issue, it might be
worthwhile to backport it to 2.0.11 as well, since that's being
supported until 2010.

Any plans on that?

So, Google's Chrome is out, and it seems nice, but WP doesn't display the
Turbo button in the top right of the admin area.
Is it possible to enable this with a plugin do we think? Presumably WP just
doesn't know anything about Chrome, so it's not showing the link.

I'll do some digging around.

It shows for me, using the latest revision of 2.7. It also reports
Safari in it's user-agent, so there's no reason why it wouldn't show
after the Safari "implementation" was added. Here's my Google Chrome
user-agent, if anyone's wondering:

"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13

I've just checked on a 2.6.1 site, and that's displaying the link. My own
site, which is 2.6, doesn't. Time to upgrade, methinks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Utilize Media Library for image selection for plugin
Message-ID: <d5d421ce0809021505n397f6933n453ad29283ebdc06@mail.gmail.com>

How can I utilize the media library for image selection in my plugin?

Overview:

I am creating a plugin which needs to have a field on its own admin panel
which selects an image. Instead of creating a new image uploader and
manager, I would like to utilize the already existing Media Library in
Wordpress.

My Progress:

I have managed to create the link which brings up the thickbox + iframe with
the media library. It seems to be focused on inserting the image into the
editor because the passed back Javascript tells the editor to insert the
HTML needed for the image. I am hoping there is an easy way to alter the
message back and turn it into a object which I can use on the admin panel.
If that doesn't work, can I easily use parts of the functionality such as
the upload form?

Any thoughts or suggestions to save myself from wasting countless hours?

I am unable to replicate the issue, so I would suspect a communication  
problem (network maybe?) between the place where you are running the  
command and the Automattic SVN server.  Are you running the upgrade  
script from the same place you are viewing the content in your browser?

I would try running this from the same place you are running the  
script and see what happens:

telnet svn.automattic.com 80

It's just improved security, not a security flaw if I'm reading it right. No
different from ditching MD5 password storage or using the better cookies
(again, if I understand the issue).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Trackbacks staying in post.to_ping
Message-ID: <48BE3B9A.6090804@awakers.com>

Dear WordPress hackers, I have the weirdest problem. My trackbacks stay 
in the to_ping column. But if I hack in a bit, I can launch them. The 
move to the pinged column but did not really ping. When I modify the 
code a bit, it works. But they still stay in to_ping for new posts. 
Here's my path so far.

Everytime I submit a post with a trackback, it stays in to_post. I 
looked in the code and it seems there's some kind of scheduled 
wp_schedule_single_event that triggers a general ping fest when there's 
a blog post. My earliest to_ping dates from 2008-08-11 08:30:42...
I made a test.php file with the following content:
<?php
require_once("wp-load.php");
do_all_pings();
?>
Then I modified wp-include/comment.php to add some debug info that will 
show up on the shell as I run my test.php script:
        print "I opened to " . $trackback_url['host'] . " with port " . 
$trackback_url['port'] . "\n";
        if(!$fs) print "FS Did not succeed\n";
        fputs($fs, $http_request);
        print "I put: $http_request\n";

Now I can see what is being outputted and I give it a shot with 
telnetting directly to a test blog I created on wordpress.com 
(awakers.wordpress.com) and surprise, it works with telnet but it did 
not work with the php code. I also notice that I got <error>0</error> so 
deduct that I should see the error message if I get wordpress' answer 
via code. I add the following two lines to comment.php
        $res = fread($fs,8192);
        print "Response:\n$res**************\n";
I am eagerly waiting to see finally what is holding my blog fury back.
Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<response>
<error>0</error>
</response>**************

What?!? I check on the blog and believe it or not, the trackback request 
is there. I make another trackback, remove the fread code and it doesn't 
work. At this point, I assume that closing the socket without reading 
some of it kills the trackback.

So that's where I stand now. The do_all_pings scheduled does not run and 
when I run things manually, it needs to read from the socket after it 
puts to it.

Here's some info about my setup that might or might not be relevant:
Running CPanel on Centos5.2 under a VMware ESXi server
The ip of the machine is 10.0.0.5 and I'm natting traffic in and out on 
required ports 80,443 etc
The router is OpenBSD's PF.

Max

So my plugin adds buttons just fine to TinyMCE in WordPress 2.6, but it
doesn't in 2.7. What do I need to change? Is it a WordPress thing or a
TinyMCE thing?

No, it's an actual security flaw, although not an easily exploitable
one, and it's not really a flaw in WordPress. It's all about weak
seeding in other programs running on the same php instance.

WordPress does not call mt_srand to seed the generator. And this is
fine, PHP seeds it itself internally. But if you're using mod_php <
5.2.6, then it's not reseeded every call, only at startup. If some
other system seeds it poorly, and leaks the mt_rand() value, then you
can predict the next mt_rand() value and exploit it. In particular,
with WordPress, you can exploit the "lost password" function, predict
the generated activation key, and reset the password on any user
account.

Here's an exploit that uses a flawed piece of software (phpBB) to both
seed the generator and grab the state of mt_rand. Once it knows the
next mt_rand, it can hack into WordPress, because WordPress does not
do any seeding on it's own, and is using the same seed as was there
already (assuming mod_php < 5.2.6):

I've seen this issue in other circumstances as well. If you do an
fsockopen, an fputs, and then an fclose, sometimes the fclose doesn't
flush the thing and your request never gets sent. Adding an fread or
better yet an fflush forces it to actually send the data and work.

In the trackback() function, find this code:
$fs = @fsockopen($trackback_url['host'], $trackback_url['port'],
$errno, $errstr, 4);
@fputs($fs, $http_request);
@fclose($fs);

Between the fputs and the fclose, add this line:
@fflush($fs);

I'll bet it'll work properly then.

In 2.7, the trackback and ping functions need to be modified to use
the new http class instead of manually using sockets and such. I'll
bring it up on trac somewhere.

True. Or we just haven't yet seen a case where the exploit is taken full 
advantage of. Or we have and just haven't noticed that this was the 
cause. It isn't really a flaw within WordPress, but it does prevent 
external web applications on the same box from being used to adversely 
affect WordPress.

I do agree with Viper007Bond, in that the security flaw isn't high 
enough to backport, but I will defer to someone who knows better (which 
might be Viper007Bond).

@fflush($fs); worked as a good replacement for fread() and it's smarter 
as well.
Now that's part 2 of the problem being fixed but that part one is that 
the scheduler does not seem to run correctly. When do_all_ping() ran 
manually, it moved to_ping to pinged even if the socket closed before 
the buffer flushed. Now that the socket issue is fixed, I'm not sure 
what to do about the scheduler. I thought about running a crontab on my 
2 line script to ping trackbacks every 5 mins but I'd like to minimize 
the modifications on the core files. Any ideas on how I can debug the 
scheduler? I did not reverse its code yet but I'm guessing, that since 
it's not using crontab, it must be answering to a trigger (like page 
views). I'll reverse the code tomorrow to understand it better but in 
the meantime, if any of you have any ideas, by all mean let me know. by 
the way, this is a fresh install of WP2.6 without any modifications what 
so ever.

If by "the scheduler", you're talking about wp-cron, then how that
works is somewhat trickier.

-On every page view, the wp_cron function is triggered (by this
add_action('init', 'wp_cron') ).
-The wp_cron function checks the cron option in the options table to
see if there's any scheduled tasks. If there are, it calls
spawn_cron().
-spawn_cron does an http hit to get_option( 'siteurl' ) .
'/wp-cron.php?check=' . wp_hash('187425'). This is basically hitting
back on itself to activate the wp-cron.php script in a separate
process.

Now, this is usually the failure point. For whatever reason, a
surprising amount of webservers are not configured to be able to
resolve their own addresses, or they have some kind of routing issue
with hitting themselves this way, or there's a security rule blocking
it, or one of half a dozen other things. So that's the first thing to
check, you want to write some code that does an http get on the same
server as the code is on. If that fails, then this is your main
problem and you need to figure out why it's failing.

When wp-cron.php is run, it checks that hash value (this is to prevent
other systems from hitting wp-cron, since the hash will be unique to
your system, as it's salted with the secret key), then gets the cron
jobs from the database and runs them. Wp-cron jobs are basically
action hooks that plugins and other core code hooks onto. In this
case, the action hook is "do_pings" and the function that gets called
is "do_all_pings".

There's no change to the way buttons are added to TinyMCE. Try accessing 
wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_config.php directly and see if the 
buttons are listed in the init.

Strange, it's working fine today, though nothing has changed wrt: the

Hello,I'm just wondering if this has been requested before or not, but I
feel that it would be nice if Wordpress could updates automatically like the
Plugins, so we don't need to open our FTP client and upload the new ones,
then go to the upgrade.php

What do you guys think?

Core upgrade is in trunk already and will hopefully be in 2.7

Sorry, the problem was the moron developer needs to follow his own dang
instructions for using the plugin. I forgot to hard refresh after enabling
my plugin as TinyMCE caches.

My plugin[1] creates a post and then modifies it which results in
multiple revisions. After that the user can do what they like with it.
I'd like my plugin to create only the post without revisions as it can
confuse the user and unnecessarily bloats their database. However when
I try to disable revisions before I create the post, I find that
WP_POST_REVISIONS is defined as a constant and so I can't disable it.
Whats the best way to do this? Should I get a hook in when before
WP_POST_REVISIONS is auto-defined and disable it then or should I just
delete the revisions that are made just after I create the post?

Thanks
Mark

Subject: [wp-hackers] Form in metabox, like Custom Fields
Message-ID: <20080904093206.04d58007@MonteCarlo>

I would like to create a metabox in the admin post and page section
with a "form" inside.

What I have right now is the following javascript:
jQuery(document).ready(function() {
		jQuery('#mysubmitbutton').click( metabox_mysubmit );
		}
	);

function metabox_mysubmit() {
	var values= new Array;
	values[0] = jQuery('tab-id').attr('value');
	if (values[0]) {
		metabox_submit('find','#mymetabox-output',values);
	}
	return false;
}
function metabox_submit(this_action, this_output, this_values){
	jQuery.post( 
		jQuery('#mb-url').attr("value")+"/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php",
		{
		 action: 'my_metabox',
		'cookie': encodeURIComponent(document.cookie),
		'mb_action': this_action,
		'mb_values[]':this_values
		},
		function(data, textStatus) {
			 jQuery(this_output).html(data);
		}
 	);
}

Together with the PHP and HTML code this works, except for when you
press enter, I need to add jQuery('#myinput').keydown(metabox_myinput);
and check for key 13 in the metabox_myinput function. I know how to do
this, just haven't got to it.

In the end this solution will work, but I have been looking at the
Custom Fields metabox and have been wondering how that one works. I
would love to write my piece of code the same way this one is written
but I can't seem to figure it out.
Is there documentation on how this is done? Could somebody direct me
how to do this or maybe it's not possible at all.
I think it has to do with the class assigned to the submit button, but
my javascript knowledge isn't completely up to par to figure it out
myself without some direction.

Thanks in advance.

Are you trying to create a meta box in general?
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_meta_box

Or specifically an AJAX-powered one like the Custom Fields one?

An AJAX powered one like the Custom Fields.
What I created works and is AJAX. When I hit the submit button it calls
the function my_metabox, or rather the function
on_wp_ajax_my_metabox as specified in the add_action call, 
add_action('wp_ajax_my_metabox', 
   array(&$this,'on_wp_ajax_my_metabox) ) ;

That function does some output and that output is displayed without a
page refresh.

I'm just curious how the Custom Fields works and if I can use that kind
of implementation in my own metabox.

P.S.
I apologize for sending it twice, I had PGP/Inline in the previous one
and I'm not sure if everybody can open it.

I don't imagine anyone would have a problem with PGP signing.  I get  
them all the time on other lists.

There may be a more automated way to do it, but if you're going to
actually write your own plugin code then you should look into the
filters called by wp_transition_post_status(), you could check for the
value there and set the post back to draft if its missing (and figure
out the error display to the user seperately).

Message-ID: <9D95992C-B208-4C5E-A9CE-ED143F61A202@xentek.net>

Fellow WP-Hackers,

I've got a plugin I've been working on for a while and am starting to  
look at branching out into more related plugins. And this got my  
thinking about the best way to organize it...

The first way, was to just add the functionality into the main plugin,  
and force the extra functionality on everyone.

The second way I thought of was to just add the other plugins into the  
original project as an optional plugin. It would require separate  
activation, but give the user a chance to choose whether or not they  
wanted to use the auxiliary plugin.

The third way, which leads to my real question, is to publish them all  
as separate plugins and then ask users to install them all to 'build  
up' the full suite of functionality.

The problem with #1 is that the name of my plugin and associated  
metadata would not accurately reflect its full capability, and while I  
could use an option to turn the extra functionality on and off, to  
avoid the 'force' aspect of adding it in, I'd still be left with a  
plugin name that no longer express all it does.

#2 is better than #1, since it now separates the plugins, but almost  
leads me to #3 immediately... that of just publishing them as separate  
plugins.

#3 is my personal favorite, since each of the plugins I see adding  
functionality to the suite won't necessarily depend on each other, but  
will work together nicely when they ARE all installed. This will  
require a bit of rework on my end, since there is a bit of the  
configuration settings that could be used by all the plugins, but it  
wouldn't be that big of an issue (I don't think).

Which got me thinking... If I was to to do this, could I then publish  
an entirely new plugin that used svn:externals to create a composite  
plugin of the full suite? In other words, will the auto-zip / download  
service on the Plugin Repository still work? I imagine that using  
propedit in SVN is going to be fine. But will the post-commit hook (or  
what ever the mechanism is that updates a plugin on the plugin  
browser) be able to correctly check out the external files and package  
them up in a zip properly? Obviously I wanted to ask about this before  
playing with it in the wild.

Eric,

I had hoped to create something that would totally own Snoopy, but 
whatever, the http.php file includes three functions for making HTTP 
requests. All of them handle redirection 301, all of them also handle 
HTTP 1.1 content chunk encoding (some hosts insist on sending chunk 
encoding when HTTP 1.0 requests are made, the bastards!).

I plan on writing a codex page on how to use the functions but 
basically, you

wp_remote_request("http://www.wordpress.org"); <--- This is used to test 
for redirection, if you get nothing, then redirection failed!

There are additional arguments you can set for the second parameter. I 
think I'll save that for the codex page.

wp_remote_get("http://wordpress.org"); <---- This sends the request as a 
GET.
wp_remote_post("http://wordpress.org", array( 'body' => 
array('something' => 'else') )); <--- This sends the request as a POST.

Yeah, if you send the body as an array, it will be automatically url 
encoded and the correct header set.

It does a lot for you to make it extremely easy and standard throughout 
the transports used. This also means that there will be bugs and I 
strongly encourage people to test the HTTP API as much as possible. 
There might be a bug in one transport that isn't in the other 
transports. The good news is that most of the transports have been 
battle tested for about two weeks, so the majority of people shouldn't 
have problems, the bad news is that if you have problems you'll probably 
be SOL.

When I say you, I don't mean you, I mean the person who experiences 
problems when 2.7 is released. However, the probably of that happening 
goes down with the more people using it and the longer people use it the 
more stable it will be. With five transports, it gets pretty tricky from 
this point. I would suggest installing the pecl HTTP extension, if you 
don't already have it, it appears to be the most stable.

Okay, I just submitted a new trac ticket*, but now I'm not sure if  
it's legit.  If not, it raises a question:

The wPhone plugin (which I love, BTW, regardless of the WP iPhone

ABSPATH . PLUGINDIR . '/wphone/includes/header.php'

This doesn't work if WP_CONTENT_DIR has a custom value, because the  
above returns the default location of the plugins directory.

Is this is a bug in WP, or is wPhone doing it wrong?

Its not a bug, Rather wPhone doing it wrong, Well.. Kind of.

Theres also WP_PLUGIN_DIR which would be  
/..../wordpress/wp-content/plugins/ in a standard install

I'm not too sure of the way forward for it to work, But PLUGINDIR is  
relative to ABSPATH, whilst WP_CONTENT_DIR is not relative, but rather,  
absolute, Because of that, PLUGINDIR can never 100% be set correctly  
automatically (without using ../../../../)

My advice:
If you wish to have
ABSPATH /home/dd32/public_html/wordpress/
and
WP_CONTENT_DIR /home/dd32/wp-content/

then to also set
PLUGINDIR ../../wp-content/plugins/
for back compat with plugins which use it, and also submit a bug report to  
the plugins author.

The use of PLUGINDIR is suggested against AFAIK.

A more future-compat version might be:
define('MY_PLUGIN_DIR', dirname(__FILE__));

Or better yet..
if ( ! defined('WP_PLUGIN_DIR') )
define('WP_PLUGIN_DIR', dirname(dirname(__FILE__)));
and then simply use WP_PLUGIN_DIR instead of worrying about ABSPATH /  
PLUGINDIR

It's because we wrote WPhone coming up on a year ago. 2.6 wasn't out then.

I was playing with this yesterday trying to update podPress to be  
compatible with WP_CONTENT_DIR while still maintaining some  
compatibility with ABSPATH and PLUGINDIR, it's not very  
straightforward how to use this new constant to me - unless you want  
to scrap compatibility with versions < 2.5.x or introduce some fairly  
complex checking.

I finally decided that creating get_content_dir_path() and  
get_content_dir_url() functions (and wrapping them in  
if_function_exists checks) was probably the best approach for backward  
compatibility and supporting the new feature.

Cheers,

But in the meantime, Snoopy does work great if you want/need backward  
compatibility and portability.

We use it extensively in our plugins, to connect to our remote API.

To be noted though, it only supports get and post, not put or delete,  
and uses the curl binary (not lib) when under https.

Is the new http.php built on Curl as well?

This is where I was more worried about snoopy than looking for the new  
functionality. I've used snoopy in the past, but was kind of looking  
for something without a dependancy on curl, a'la Zend_Http, but using  
that would add lots of undue files to the plugin, and force it to be  
php5 only.

I'll use snoopy for now, and track the progress of http.php.

Thanks All!

The new http.php supports the HTTP PHP extension, the cURL PHP 
extension, Streams (fopen), Sockets (Fopen), and fsockopen. It is 
supported on PHP4 and PHP5. You can install the HTTP extension on PHP4 
and it will be used.

Snoopy only supports cURL and fsockopen/fopen (forget which). The 
purpose was to support everything to enable telling users who have 
issues that they are SOL and should change hosts to one that doesn't 
suck. It won't work out that way until the five above are working perfectly.

So, if those are all available, which one will it use?

Well, I accidentally listed them in the order they will be used. I 
should say the first one that is available to be working will be used, 
however there is a different list for POST and GET. The POST list is 
smaller, because not all of the transports supports sending content to 
the requested server. That is HTTP, Streams, and fsockopen will be used, 
in that order, to send requests that have a body. I'm sure cURL can be 
used, but haven't yet found a way that matches the other transports.

I suggest installing the HTTP PHP extension (very easy to install using 
PECL), one because it has worked better than any of the others and is 
supported on PHP4 and PHP5. When it gets down to Streams, Sockets, and 
fsockopen, then it gets a little more difficult to say if the request 
will be reliable. That and the fsockopen has the most code need to 
support the features the other support natively, so it is slower and 
venerable to bugs.

The HTTP extension pretty much does everything, so the level of 
abstraction is almost nonexistent compared to the others.

Message-ID: <2102fd710809071542p1440fa61je0c46060b35843d9@mail.gmail.com>

In order to help pin down the compatibility of a theme I'm involved with, is
there an easy way to determine at which point functions such as is_tag or
is_front_page were introduced into the core?

I realize we could use function_exists() but at the moment we aren't and
even going that route, which functions should have it and which shouldn't?
Again, being able to know when WordPress functions were introduced would
help.

You can usually take a look at the Inline Documentation to find this
out (look at the @since tag). According to the Inline Docs for these
functions (they're in wp-includes/query.php), is_front_page() has
existed since 2.5.0 and is_tag() has existed since 2.3.0.

There was a site that listed these in a more useful way, but it's
bookmarked on another computer, and I can't find it right now (the
site, not the computer :P ).

There's a function reference here that shows which WP versions 
introduced various functions, up to 2.3. Maybe we could convince Ozh to 
update it, hmmm?

Actually, I created an repository and a web site. However, both the 
repository, well the repository is still up, but I'm not going to give 
the link. The site is down and will be down until probably Tuesday. It 
is becoming a non-issue as you can get the information in the source, 
and you can also get the information from Peter Westwood sandbox site 
(it is a really difficult to remember url).

The core team is adding the @since tags to new functions, so you can get 
that information there as well. I do think it is nice to have a place 
where you can get all of the information at a single place, but I think 
if you know where the function is, you can also look at the since 
information as well.

PS: Mine only goes to 2.6.0, I haven't yet added 2.6.1 to the list, 
because mostly it isn't needed. Some 2.7 functions were probably 
backported, so it would be useful to know which ones.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Suggestions on Exposing Plugin to End Users
Message-ID: <004501c9117f$adf1bef0$09d53cd0$@com>

For a while I have been working on a WordPress plugin which allows WordPress
to be used to manage a youth swim team.  Managing a swim team means keeping
track of a lot of data, some of which is collected from end users (like
swimmer names, ages, address, gender, etc.) and other information is simply
made available to the end users (meet results, swimmer time history,
schedules, records, etc.)

To date most of the work I have done has been via the Dashboard.  Users with
Admin privileges can see and manipulate all of the swim team data and
subscribers can see their own data, manipulate some of it, and see data
which has been deemed necessary for subscribers to see (e.g. directions and
maps to a swim meet).

Currently I have all of the Swim Team admin functionality under the
Dashboard Manage menu and all of the User interaction functionality under
the User menu.  For the most part this works fine (although the Dashboard is
slow) bu after playing with 2.7 and it's new menu structure, I am not sure
my usage model will continue to make sense.

The Admin function works fine but the End user function doesn't have a
logical home with the new menus.

I have been wondering if there is a better (preferred?) way to manage the
user interaction?  I supposed I could generate a page when the plugin is
installed which contains the same content that the plugin displays on the
User screen but I am not sure what I give up by not going through the
standard plugin path.

I am open to suggestions.

Thanks,

Mike

Message-ID: <161617690809080712j6dc002b9je3fba450dd49bbf5@mail.gmail.com>

Down in rewrite.php, this code generates the rewrite rules for /page/XX:

$pageregex = 'page/?([0-9]{1,})/?$';
...
$pagematch = $match . $pageregex;
$pagequery = $index . '?' . $query . '&paged=' .
$this->preg_index($num_toks + 1);



Later, this code generates it for <permalink>/XX

//allow URLs like <permalink>/2 for <permalink>/page/2
$match = $match . '(/[0-9]+)?/?$';
$query = $index . '?' . $query . '&page=' . $this->preg_index($num_toks + 1);


Is there any reason why the first one uses "paged" while the second
one uses "page"?

I think if you control the End Users' "roles" properly, they won't  
even see the menu stuff that doesn't apply to them.

If you're doing a lot of custom functionality (which it sounds as  
though you are...) you might consider making a new top level menu for  
it.

You also might look into using the Role Manager plugin.  It allows you  
to create new user types, and control what specific abilities each  
type has.

See this page:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities
Be sure to see the "resources" section at the bottom for plugins.

Between those two, you should be able to completely control the end  
users' experience.  If certain users should only be doing a few  
specific things, then controlling Roles is the way to go.

That's generally my way to go lately:  Check if the newer constant has  
been defined, and if not, define it, then use it normally.  That way  
your plugin works just fine even in WP versions before the constant  
existed.

To Viper -- I wasn't trying to criticize wPhone.  The WP app  
notwithstanding, I still love this plugin, and I hope it continues to  
be developed -- at least for base compatibility purposes.

I subscribed to it like 4 years ago and I think I've had one email so

It's a different kind of paging. The first refers to "Previous posts"
pages of home and affects the query LIMIT. The second is for reading
the parts of a multi-page post (see function setup_postdata) and does
not affect the query.

Cool, but methinks this works a touch better.  You're forgetting  
WP_SITEURL, and I added WP_PLUGIN_DIR for completeness:

// Pre-2.6 compatibility
if ( ! defined( 'WP_CONTENT_URL' ) ) {
	if ( defined( 'WP_SITEURL' ) )
		define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', WP_SITEURL . '/wp-content' );
	else
		define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', get_option( 'url' ) . '/wp-content' );
}
if ( ! defined( 'WP_CONTENT_DIR' ) )
	define( 'WP_CONTENT_DIR', ABSPATH . 'wp-content' );
if ( ! defined( 'WP_PLUGIN_URL' ) )
	define( 'WP_PLUGIN_URL', WP_CONTENT_URL. '/plugins' );
if ( ! defined( 'WP_PLUGIN_DIR' ) )
	define( 'WP_PLUGIN_DIR', WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/plugins' );


The answer to the ambiguity of PLUGINDIR is of course simply not to  
use it. :)

I dont use this two constants before in other plugins.

only point: get_option('siteurl') is better as url

Subject: [wp-hackers] Bug? wp_update_term and filter pre_update_term
Message-ID: <d5d421ce0809090904j60dc06c8t42ac818e720ccae4@mail.gmail.com>

Checking to see if this is a bug.

When using the function wp_update_term, it results in an error because $args
is not an array for array_merge. Obviously I am passing in an array, the
filter pre_update_term is run on $args before array_merge which makes $args
into the term id. I was able to fix this in my code by creating a dummy
filter which returns the $args instead of the post id:

function dummy_put($term, $taxonomy, $args ) {
    return $args;
}
add_filter( 'pre_update_term', 'dummy_put', 10, 3 );

Is it expected that plugin authors will know to create the dummy filter,
does the dummy filter need to be a WP default, or do plugin authors need to
avoid wp_update_term altogether?

wp_update_term:

This seems pretty useful/important so I added it to the codex:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Determining_Plugin_and_Content_Directories

linked from: http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Resources#Plugin_Development_Basics

If a couple of you who worked that code out could read it and make
sure I'm not leading anyone astray that would be great. (esp. Sam
Bauers if you're reading this, as my brain exploded when I tried to
think whether this would work with the process you described in your
wcsf talk: http://unlettered.org/2008/08/17/wordcamp-presentations/ ).

Err... What? I can't find a "pre_update_term" anywhere in the code,
and I see no filters being run on $args at all in the code that you're
pointing to.

Question:  Is it necessary to check for SITEURL or is that redundant?   
Should that test be excised in favor of simply using  
get_option( 'siteurl' ) ?

(It certainly won't _hurt_, but I prefer code to be only as long as  
necessary.)

The WP_SITEURL branch is redundant, get_option has a filter for siteurl on  
it by default to return that on get_option('siteurl):

WP_SITEURL is for overriding the database value (I use it so I can use a
copy of my database on my localhost without editing it). It should not be
used nor set by a plugin.

With respect to non-English speakers, I don't think that constant is  
of much use to plugin developers, as any plugin-specific language  
files would almost certainly be in that plugin's folder.

the question may be rude, pardon my french (actually, I'm french)

I just wanted to know if the release calendar is planned, with a
"submit your changes before" date, a "don't bother if it's not
critical" date, and an actual release date...
or ... if it was more like "stuff it till it cries", then release ?

There is a release schedule, There is a feature freeze at a certain point  
beforehand (~ 1 month?) after which no new features go in. Major features  
are put into trunk as early as possible to allow for full development time  
to occur.

http://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/ explains the dates for future releases  
and gives a short writeup.

As for the features that are chosen, They're mainly the short-list  
candidates from core devs who say "I want to implement this", then theres  
people coming along on trac and saying "I like this feature, So i've  
written a patch, What do you guys think?". Quite often core devs will  
choose a feature they feel like doing according to something that was  
raised on a mailing list, or the ideas tracker:  
http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/ or Just some functionality they saw in  
another product which would go well in WP..

This is all an AFAIK :)

line of code prevents me from releasing a big directory plugin...

Have you filed a Trac ticket? http://trac.wordpress.org/
Trac is the best way to tell the devs about limiations you're running  
into, But only if its an actual bug in WP (Or you need an extra filter or  
2 to achieve your goal)

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7427

I need another taxonomy :)

I could release without the fix. Just would have to recode stg like
2000 lines of PHP just to change 'category' to 'myowntaxonomy'

Actually, a filter would work. Updated the ticket.

The reason the ticket hasn't been worked on is, because get_categories 
only handles the category taxonomy. It is also for backwards 
compatibility with previous versions. I'm not exactly sure what you are 
trying to achieve that would force you to change the category taxonomy 
to 'myowntaxonomy', but that doesn't seem like something that belongs 
within that function.

The core developers have already mentioned the purpose and the reason 
why the patch and why the ticket is invalid or wontfix (in my opinion). 
If you are trying to tell people that, hey use this code <?php 
get_categories("type=zelist_category"); ?>, because people konw and 
understand get_categories, but not ze_category_list().

If you are writing a plugin, then you have to expect a level of 
redundancy on the part of users having to plug your function in instead 
of the core function. Alas, the WordPress library is GPL, so you don't 
need to write 2000 lines of code, you just need to copy 2000 lines of 
code and modify a couple hundred or two to get it working with your 
taxonomy.

I close with a disclaimer, I'm not a core developer, so you know a 
filter might work. I'm not the one you need to convince.

Actually get_categories handles two taxonomies, the post categories
taxonomy and the link taxonomy.

And my plugin, a directory plugin, need its own taxonomy, since it
allows regular posts + "website listing ~ posts".  I know the few
others directory plugins for WP works within the post taxonomy, but I
dare to say zeList is a little bit more powerful and feature-rich than
those.

A filter request seems appropriate and not too much to ask : who
should I bribe ? :)

The purpose of the get_categories is to retrieve all of the categories 
and then make them backwards compatible. What you are trying to do is to 
get all of your taxonomy terms. It would be simple to create your own 
function for achieving that. Of the 9 line function body, you only need 
2 lines to create your own function. I'm not sure where you are getting 
2000 lines of code, but forcing the core code to dance around your 
modifications is not something I would be happy about without good 
enough reason.

Functions of that limited purpose should stay limited to prevent over 
reaching the scope and reducing the optimizations the function is meant 
to achieve. get_terms() is well flexible enough to allow you enough 
freedom to employ in any fashion to create your own function for what 
you have in mind.

You can also create an wrapper around get_categories by using the 
'include' argument for get_categories(). If you get the IDs of the terms 
of your taxonomy, you can include your specialized categories along with 
the WordPress ones.

You can also hook into the 'get_terms' filter and look for the 
'category' and 'link_category' taxonomies to add your taxonomy terms to. 
I mean, I not sure exactly what you are trying to achieve or how, but 
there are several ways around not doing anything to get_categories().

I'm not sure why these two solutions above would not solve your problem 
with the least amount of additional modification to get_categories().

Who should you bribe? I'm not sure, if you put forth a good enough 
argument to westi or ryan, they might commit your patch. Well thought 
out arguments explaining the benefits of the patch to everyone will go a 
long way. I have a hell of a time explaining my positions, telling 
someone, "... because I said so," doesn't really work I've found and 
putting to word my abstract ideas and arguments is a little above my 
current intelligence. Wonder how much 20 points can mean when it comes 
to an IQ and I do wish I had them sometimes.

Well, good luck with your arguments and the patch. That said, I'm going 
to do everything possible to argue against your position, no matter how 
childish it seems. Don't let that stop you, though.

I don't need the modification to actually get the categories of my own
taxonomy. I need the modification for all the other WP functions to
get the categories of my own taxonomy.

Without the mod, I'd have to recode one or two dozens of (big)
functions which start by $categories = &get_categories($r); and do not
apply filters on it. Maybe not 2 000 lines of code, but surely like a
40ko futile copy / paste of functions, and conditional tags in all the
templates files ( if(is_directory()) my_list_categories($args); else
wp_list_categories($args); ).
Copy pasting is not above my level, and time is not an issue (find and
replace 'category' => 'my_category' ). But adding 40k of code, and
almost making a fork of major WP functions is an issue regarding speed
and future maintenance.

Well, I'd like all these major WP functions to know what I have in my
mind, but well..

Point is :
instead of replacing the call in 40 or so functions which all ask for
get_categories(), I find it more elegant to act on the get_categories
itself.

my specialised categories don't mix with post categories. and fetching
the correct ID for all categories call = twice the SQL load.

the get_terms filter is way too late in the function to do that. I
mean, it is in the right position (just before the return), but it's
after the query and after the sorting.

Well, after DD32 thoughtful reply, a simple filter addition would do
the trick, without compromizing the code.

I agree that get_categories() is designed mearly for categories, However,  
As Malaiac has pointed out, creating a new  function would involve  
duplicating a lot of the functions which rely on it.
I do not see any harm in moving 'taxonomy' into the args list for the  
default, And doing so should mean it'll filter down from the functions  
which rely upon the get_categories() function

Ah, I like to think of the WordPress API as a black box in which my 
solutions do not involve modifying the core purpose of WordPress 
functions to serve my ends. In programming, you are not always going to 
have the advantage of being able to modify the library for which you 
use, therefore it makes for almost disappointing practice to assume that 
the author of the library you use will bow to your will, just because it 
will make your life easier.

After looking it over again, it would be super easy to include the 
taxonomy argument with little overhead and increase the power of a few 
relatively general purpose functions. I can then agree that I should 
withhold further judgment until I see a patch for which to critique. It 
is not the way I would have went about solving the problem if it was me, 
but I forget not everyone is a fan of torturing themselves.

is_directory() actually does sound pretty good function. I would add a 
prefix to any function you create that is uniform for your plugin, 
myplugin_is_directory() and myplugin_my_list_categories().

I should have said, "specific purpose", which is to get the category 
taxonomy of /WordPress/, not every taxonomy in WordPress and plugins. If 
it won't be that much more to add the taxonomy to the argument and allow 
it to be used, it makes sense to want to allow those to be reused. Reuse 
is a programming concept I agree with.

That doesn't sound like good development practices. There are many 
libraries that I wish would do thing differently, but hey, they aren't 
going to change just because of one punk guy saying, "You should allow 
unlimited or additional extensibility." It would make more sense to 
create a generic function which do the dropdown, because I believe there 
are several areas that offer that functionality.

So instead of widening the scope of specific functions for yet another 
purpose, you are bloating those functions. Then again, for performance 
reasons, in tests I've done creating another function to reduce 
redundancy ends up increasing overhead from PHP having to create the 
function stack, setup the variables and then exit the stack when complete.

I will say that the Plugin API has an upper limit of how many hooks that 
can be performed before it takes a full second to perform those actions. 
Depends on your system, but I do like my system because everything is 
slower and I can actually see how long functions take relative to each 
other. You might want to test the performance of your plugin, depending 
on the size of it.

Well, for performance reasons, you can still create the generic dropdown 
based on the code from categories, users, etc, but not use it in the 
WordPress API. Have it just for plugins.

Indeed. I remembered too late that the WHERE clause might also include 
the taxonomy.

It would be at a cost to have to go through all of the get_terms 
functionality just to replace it with your own. It would be easier and 
at a lower cost to simply pass the correct taxonomy to begin with.

Yeah, if your purpose is to make the other functions that use 
get_categories more general purpose, then it seems that the action you 
are preforming is one that is known before hand and can be passed as one 
of the arguments. No filter, just allow the taxonomy to be set within 
the $args parameter.

No, my limiting factor is that I'm a zealot for my programming paradigm. 
I don't agree with what you are trying to achieve based on one of my 
principles for programming. I don't do things, because I'm limited by my 
average IQ, well not always at least. I do it because I feel it is the 
right way to do it.

It would be nice if WordPress was more flexible, but it would be at the 
cost of time and performance. My fear is still that another is going to 
come along and soon this and that does this and also that as well as 
another several tasks it was not meant for.

The functions you point to are for presentation and in my programming 
paradigm it is acceptable to recreate new functions for your specific 
purpose or refactor existing presentation functions to allow for 
additional reuse. From what you described, to me the solution is either 
to 1) add filters to those dozen or so functions to allow for reuse (the 
negative impact of performance is justified by only having the filter 
where it is needed or 2) create a generic API for presentation layer and 
allow reuse of it instead.

You will notice that I don't mention get_categories(). There are 
disadvantages to everything. Mostly the time it will take increases with 
those two, your solution would probably take less than 30 minutes to 
complete whereas, the second solution would take several hours, plus 
additional time for testing and writing test cases. Those are my ideal 
solutions, but I doubt I'm going to implement them myself.

So you know, another one of my programming principles is that if you can 
do something in five minutes verses 8 hours, then I'm going to go with 
the five minutes solution first and put the "right" 4 to 8 hour solution 
on the back burner. But you know, it is the weekend coming up, so if you 
insult my intelligence further, I might just jump in to action to prove 
you wrong. Whether or not I succeed is really not the issue at that 
point. Also, probably not going to be committed since it would be an 
overwhelming change and it is a little late in the development cycle. It 
would take more debate than you know an additional three lines of code 
to get_categories().

Don't torture yourself. Leave that pleasure to others :)


More seriously, I kind of expect the author of the library (generally
speaking) to include all the necessary filters and actions.
Application of filters in WP functions is not systemic which is
sometimes regrettable.

I'm looking for any reference/doc on Wordpress built in filters.
eg. 	$title = apply_filters('wp_title', $title, $sep);
how can I know what filters are applied on a brand new WP install ? I
mean built in filters, not plugins filters. If there is any !

wp-includes/default-filters.php is a good place to start for front-end  
related filters.

Hey,

This may have already been discussed, but I was wondering how possible it
would be to display what SVN revision the current WP install is using in the
admin footer.

We currently have "You are using a development version (2.7-hemorrhage).
Cool! Please stay updated.", it would be nice if I could hover over the
"(2.7-hemorrhage)" and the tooltip say "Revision 8883".

Is this possible? Through the use of a plugin would be best I think, no
point adding overhead to WP for a feature only techies will benefit from.

I have done this for many PHP projects that use SVN, it's just a case  
of reading 'entries' in the base .svn folder.  The revision number is  
on the 4th line.

Message-ID: <ca7320070809132010q2a81629cr32f5317e5cc237ce@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks-

I've been using trunk on one of my blogs and tracked the Crazyhorse stuff. I
guess part of me hoped that there would be some sense brought to it, but
then everything I hated about it was merged into trunk. No offense to anyone
who did any of the work, but it just doesn't feel right. Thinking it might
just be me, I got second opinions. It just doesn't feel right.

Granted, we're on this course now and there's no turning back. It would be
nice, though, if there were a option to use the more traditional backend
instead. Something along the lines of the Fresh/Classic color scheme
switcher. Thoughts?

There is also a way of making it happen automatically, kind of like  
CVS's $Id$ tag that gets replaced.

Unfortunately it appears the $rev$ keyword is the latest revision of that  
file, not of Repo itself, Theres a svnversion binary, but it appears that  
needs to be run on the local working copy of the repo in order to achieve  
the result, it doesnt happen magically like the keywords.

I do not share you lack of distaste in Crazyhorse. I do think it is 
almost humorous that there are many bugs just testing through it. I 
haven't filed any bug reports because there are just too many that they 
would be overwhelmed. I'm going to take note of them and wait until the 
freeze is conducted before filing the tickets. Hopefully, they will be 
corrected. It is the second half of September and while it is far more 
stable than when I first looked at it, I'm still not going to upgrade.

To me personally, the level of customization within the various pages is 
enjoyable. I have to say, I find some sort of happiness being able to 
remove tags column, as well as other columns that I can see myself not 
using on some WordPress projects.

I think too many people are seeing this as a new administration panel 
instead of what it is meant to be, an iteration of the current 
administration panel. Yeah, there are many changes being made, but many 
of them are needed to ensure the ease of usability. Many parts are 
intuitive and I suggest giving the newborn some time before judging it 
"ugly" perhaps it will grow up to be quite beautiful.

If you are more specific in your objections, I'm sure the team might be 
able to do something about it. They are currently collecting input on 
whether the "New Post" button should be at the top or where the menu is. 
That was added after the testing and so there haven't been enough input 
on which location it should be.

I think the actually verson of the design in backend is very ugly. The
html and CSS is very bad und man gugs.
Th deisgn is also hard for plugin-authors. Many plugins is must write
a new page for options.
I hope, this is noct the end of the design in  backend and i hope
alos, the user can change on your progile to the last 3 design (WP2.3
and WP 2.5 classic and frsh)

Sorry for my bad english!

Liebe Gr?sse

Message-ID: <59e7f3130809140310j3f398836mf932a5e1611d77ed@mail.gmail.com>

I am playing with the 'posts_where' filter, called by WP_Query::get_posts()
the call is  : $where = apply_filters('posts_where', $where);
My function is add_filter('posts_where','my_filter_function');

In a page, let's say I have :
one regular $wp_query, showing the posts of the homepage
one $last_pages = another WP_Query
one $most_commented_posts = another WP_Query

These three queries will run through the posts_where filter.

How may the my_filter_function know which one it is ?
How could the my_filter_function know if it's a page or post, or stg
other, query ?
What if my_filter_function needs to know the current query vars ?

global $wp_query; print_r($wp_query->query_vars); will work only for
the first one (and wrong for the two others)
global $qv / global $q; won't work since $qv and $q are not declared global;
I could manually test in the function (if($most_commented_posts)
then() elseif $last_pages then() else (...use $wp_query) )... not very
elegant.

any other ideas ? I'm not an OOP guru, so I may miss something here.

I like how everyone is commenting on the looks of the admin area and it's
not even done yet.

As for a new options page, all of my plugins work just fine in 2.7 with no
modifications. Not quite sure what you mean.

I use in a lot of plugins with mayx options the html of the metaboxes,
open/cles div-areas.
This ist not a nice css in 2.7

Why ist not possible to set for the user a design?

I'm assuming that the plugins options page contention is that the  
usual "/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=plugin_dir/plugin_file.php"  
seems to not be working and does not load the plugin's options pages.

But this might just be because it's not ready yet.

For me its not about the look and feel or ugliness. Is about
usability. After a month of using and hoping I'd "get used to it",
understanding from years of being a support person that users are
change-averse but generally get used to changes after time, and I have
not got used to it. It doesn't "feel" right and its not about colors,
fonts, or backend functionality.

If someone cares to clarify the semantic efforts here, I'd welcome it.
To me, though, its a layour change like any other layout change. I'm
happy to be corrected. I admit not being close to the development
cycle on this.

What about setting your custom filter in the template right before  
calling get_posts and removing the filter right afterward?

foreach query, and giving the current instance as a parameter of the function ?
that's not a plugin anymore...
(technically possible but not reproductible)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Merge Tags
Message-ID: <5a1dad880809141007g5bb2b070n10d2ef494beb5e4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Just thought I'd give the hackers a heads-up on a ticket I just posted for
merging tags.
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7740
Wondering what people think about the proposed functionality?

I was debating as to whether we give users the choice of which old slugs
still point to the new one, or if we just make the old ones automatically
point to the new tag.

Also, a nice touch would be to automatically populate the 'new primary tag'
with whichever old one had the most posts associated with it. If I was
merging tags A and B, and tag A was used in 10 posts, with tag B in 20, tag
B would automatically be suggested as the new tag. The suggested slug would
also reflect tag B.

Any thoughts on this are much appreciated.

2 cents : a dropdown box with the most legitimate old tag pre selected.

I thought that too, but then the example I posted with the ticket showed
that users may want to define a completely different tag name:

I've got the following tags which all mean the same thing:

TV, the box, telly

I select them all in edit-tags.php, select 'Merge' and 'Apply'. In the
popup box I choose 'television' as the primary tag, 'television' as
the slug, and list the old tags in the textarea.

I now have a tag called 'television' which has "television, TV, the
box, telly" all pointing to it, so my old URL's still work. All of my
posts which use the old tags have now magically swapped to using
'television'.


Although it's likely 'television' would have been used at some point, and
therefore available in the dropdown, it's not certain.

If you want a plugin to show the SVN revision, it'd probably go a little
something like this...

Thanks Dan, that works great, how do you think we would go about getting
that revision number to appear in a tooltip when hovering
over "(2.7-hemorrhage)"?
I think the HTML we would want would go <span
title="8889">(2.7-hemorrhage)</span>, but I took a quick look through the
update.php file and I got confused with the '%1$s' translation stuff.

If we could get that tooltip commited to core, I think it would make lots of
testers very happy!

Just a note that 'Reversion' should be 'Revision', but I agree this  
will really help.

Why is it not possible to set the backend-theme in the user-settings.
All functions for this feature is in the core. It si hard for many
users you change very often the design.
I use wordpress in many buisiness-bligs with many authors. I set the
backend theme on design of WP 2.3 - the people tha tankyou, she will
not changes i the backend.

Made a small change to the way the revision is displayed, so it's a little
less obtrusive...

Now, anybody got a clue how I can make up a patch to have this tooltip in
the footer?...

Brilliant, thanks.
Perhaps you could upload this to wordpress.org/extend and let wp-testers
know, I'm sure they would appreciate it! I would upload it. but it's not my
plugin! :)

bbPress passes a 'name' to each BB_Query AFAIK, It allows for plugins to  
hook onto "post authors query" or "thread selection query" or "custom API  
query", Perhaps something similar could be intrduced into WordPress?

I suggested making everyone happy by building some sort of "user-made
admin template" API, back in August.
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-August/021448.html
Got a bit of traction around here, if I remember well, but now we're
too far in dev, and too close to feature freeze, to think about that.
I think its too bad, really, 'cos it could really have been a huge
plus for both users (ability to choose between 2.3, 2.5 and 2.7-style)
and developers (ability to build tailor-made admin for clients).

I still think it's a neat idea, and wish the core-team would consider
this for the near future (2.7 might be too late, so 2.8?)

That'd be a nightmare waiting to happen. Theme developers seem to have
enough trouble adding wp_head() and wp_footer() to their themes, I couldn't
imagine how they'd do with admin themes.

I think the current method of just changing the CSS of the admin area is
just fine. I mean, look how different the various admin theme plugins can
make the admin area look without changing any of the DOM. Heck, worst case
scenario they could tweak the DOM via JS or PHP's output buffer.

I agree.. But they're going to have to start from scratch with the 2.7  
admin i think..

Theming the backend shouldnt be *too* hard at present(But i'm not going to  
be the one who does it!), theres only a handful of files which contain  
html (and things are being moved to an API allready - Options pages) - But  
as you say, The admin theme would need to keep up with changes and  
functionality changes..

I'd be cool with changing the CSS of the admin area, if it was both
stable and documented. As it is, AFAIK, it is more of a question of
guess work, trial and errors. And not all themes developers (ie.
designers more than coders) want to deal with the Plugin API.
Having a solid way to update/modifiy the CSS has long been a request
of some themes, even more so since the introduction of the
"Fresh/Classic" color schemes. Some altruistic developers build it up,
like James Dimick (
http://www.jamesdimick.com/creations/easy-admin-color-schemes/ ), but
the huge change of 2.7, one could think the core-devs would have used
the "let's start from scratch" admin redesigning as a justification
for going the obvious next step in this matter : at least explicit
admin-CSS, at best an API...

Of course that would mean many many badly-built admin themes, just
like there are a humongous number horribly-built wp themes out there,
but in the end this would allow WP to be shipped with 2 or even 3
admin theme, and that's about enough to make all users happy without

happy devs that live by selling custom WP, who'd be able to custom it
even further. All this to say, I don't see anything wrong with this
direction :)

There already is an API to change the admin CSS via a plugin, three ways
infact (listed from best to worst methods)

1)  Use wp_admin_css_color() to register a new admin "color" which requires
a new CSS file, so just add the custom CSS in there (the colors you pass to
that function are only used for the theme picker, they aren't actually used
CSS wise). When the user picks the new color scheme, they are actually
picking a while new design. When you switch between Fresh and Classic, you
just happen to be using two designs that look the same minus colors.

2)  Enqueue a new stylesheet:  if ( is_admin() ) wp_enqueue_style(
'my-admin-theme', plugins_url('/my-admin-theme/theme.css'), array(),
'1.0.0', 'screen' );      but this isn't per-user like #1 is.

3)  Least preferred method, but you could just hook into "admin_head" and
output a <style> tag.


Short of actual admin themes (which I discussed earlier and mentioned why
they'd be a bad idea), I can't think of how it could be any easier to reskin
the admin area. Heck, I have been using the above methods to make tweaks to
the admin area for ages now (for example, to make the category picker box
much taller so there's no scrollbar).

And WordPress does ship with two admin themes already (Fresh and Classic).
They are the same design though, but that's because the devs pick one horse
and stick with it as it's been determined it's the "best" choice.

One suggestion: run the extracted revision number through the 
attribute_escape() function. Never trust external data, even when you 
*think* it can be trusted. If an unauthorized attacker found a way to 
create an .svn/entries file, he could cause javascript to be injected 
into the admin footer, otherwise.

An unlikely possibility to be sure, but you can never be too safe :)

Thanks for pointing that out! I often forget to think about that when
throwing together little hacks like this.

So why not have an option to set the default wp-admin theme/style?  It
would just be adding a few more options, some extra code here n there,
and would make a huge difference to the users.

OH yes, it is easy to add a style for change the users: function
wp_admin_css_color() add new adress with css-files and small
paramters. The user can change in his user-site and use your style and
not the newest wordpress-style with anyone version of wordpress.

I write for many sites new admin-style for corporate identity and
wordpress bring a new verison with many feature sfor business. The
business users and writes in the backend dont understand the new
design - she say: why an new version.

wp_admin_css_color() is realy nice for corporate id in backend and is
very goog for the 	adjudication in business.

Sorry for my bad english.

Liebe Gr?sse

Subject: [wp-hackers] Basic filter question
Message-ID: <349fe48b0809151044n2ac6241fw88955cdc635fdbf@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I was wondering if it was possible to pass an extra argument to a
function called from a filter, e.g.


function my_function($content, $extra_argument) {
    // Do something to the $content based on $extra_argument
}

add_filter('the_content', 'my_function', 10, 2, 'extra_argument_value1');
add_filter('the_excerpt', 'my_function', 10, 2, 'extra_argument_value2');


I know I can just have two similar functions, but that's not the idea.

Is this simply because you want to know what the current filter is? Or
do you have some other reason?

Because you can just call current_filter() inside your filter to gt
'the_content' or 'the_excerpt' in your two examples.

That won't work, but you could do
add_filter('the_content', create_function('$content', 'return
my_function($content, "extra_argument_value1");'),  10);

However, there might be some performance issues with that.

That got approved quickly! Here's the new version:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/show-svn-revision/

You might have to download it from there to get it to update automatically
in the future, but I'm not sure.  This version includes both methods
(tooltip and extra line) but you can turn the extra line off.  That info is
in the installation instructions.  I'm going to go post this in the testers
list, so I apologize if you get two emails about it.

I just wanted to know what filter it was. Thanks for both solutions.

If it was possible to find anything in the Install Plugins search
functionality, I would install it immediately. But for the life of me,
I cannot find any term or tag or name or any way to find your plugin
via a search in there.

Seriously, the search functionality on wordpress.org SUCKS. Can we get
this fixed any time soon?

Or at least can we explain why "cforms II" is the top search result 9
times out of 10, regardless of the term? I mean, when I search for
"show-svn-revision", which is the actual NAME OF THE PLUGIN, and the
first 6 results are cformsII - contact form, NextGEN Gallery, Akismet,
WP Super Cache, and Lighter Menus, then something is horribly wrong,
no?

My username is "DanCoulter". You should be able to find it by searching by
author.

I agree.  Right now, the Install Plugins page is nearly useless.

Subject: [wp-hackers] filter the default post to edit
Message-ID: <59e7f3130809152100r67f586e2pb5181d3e8a1420f@mail.gmail.com>

I think I tried all actions.
in post-new.php, how should I be able to modify the default post ?

[usage : users can pre fill some values in an external form, values
which are used to calculate some custom fields, change the post status
to 'published' - for direct publishing, and change the post_mime_type]

I traced the script actions :
[post-new.php]

<header>

action('admin_menu')

<menu>

action('admin_notices')

$post = get_default_post_to_edit() << $post is defined here

<edit-form-advanced.php...

<< and is used in the first part of edit-form-advanced, without any
filtering or action possibility !!

then some actions, late in the page...
	do_action('post_relatedlinks_list');
	do_action('submitpost_box');
	do_meta_boxes('post', 'normal', $post);
	do_action('edit_form_advanced');
	do_action('dbx_post_advanced');
	do_meta_boxes('post', 'advanced', $post);
	do_action('dbx_post_sidebar');

...>


Any ideas how to modify the default $post according to user generated values ?

Message-ID: <59e7f3130809152114g46823fd1yde42028c03348bd3@mail.gmail.com>

exemple :
function get_tags_to_edit() // in wp-admin/includes/taxonomy.php
{
$tags = wp_get_post_tags($post_id);
if ( !$tags ) return false;
<tags cleaning>
$tags_to_edit = apply_filters('tags_to_edit',$tags_to_edit);
return $tags_to_edit;
}

What if the $tags are empty ? The function return false, with no way
to act on that.
Why couldn't it be
if ( !$tags ) return apply_filters('tags_to_edit',false);
?

Agreed, the return should skip down to the filter and pass in false to it.

Corrected function:
function get_tags_to_edit( $post_id ) {
	$post_id = (int) $post_id;
	if ( !$post_id )
		return false;

	$tags = wp_get_post_tags($post_id);

	if ( $tags ) {
		foreach ( $tags as $tag )
			$tag_names[] = $tag->name;
		$tags_to_edit = join( ',', $tag_names );
		$tags_to_edit = attribute_escape( $tags_to_edit );
	} else {
		$tags_to_edit = false;
	}
	$tags_to_edit = apply_filters( 'tags_to_edit', $tags_to_edit );
	return $tags_to_edit;
}

My use cases are wordpress.com & wordpress-mu.  A major UI annoyance for 
me was the split between the left-aligned & right-aligned menus; so in 
that sense I'm deeply hoping wpmu will be able to make the multi-site 
options fit into the left-nav.

For your use case, what "doesn't feel right"?  Does it just feel 
"different," or are there concrete things that you can point to and 
reason out why they're wrong?

If you're a long-term user, it's normal to be annoyed by change, even if 
that change be beneficial long-term.  Muscle-memory is hard to rewrite ;)

But if there were specifics you could discuss, I'm sure that'd help the 
UI guys.

Sorry, I didn't mean to express anger about the survey being closed
already (I guessed it reached a sufficient number of responses), I
want to express amazement at the speed it reached it :)

Thanks for reopening it for a while, I let it know to the WP-fr readers.

Subject: [wp-hackers] What does the last line in the wpautop function do?
Message-ID: <3283f0830809171821n5dc29a6w3d3ba5a152f78259@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I have a single post that isn't making it through the wpautop filter ( all
the others do ).
I can remove the filter and the post prints without formatting.

I've gone into the wpautop function itself for testing and found that the
problem is in the last line that runs preg_replace.

If I die( $pee ); directly before the last preg_replace I get the post
content as expected.
If I die( $pee ); directly after the last preg_replace I get nothing at all
( $pee is empty ).

I need to find out what about this individual post in relation to the final
line of wpautop is not jiving correctly. Unfortunately, I don't have any
bragging rights in the regex arena (I can tell it has to do with shortags).
Could anyone help me understand what this line is doing so that I might
better troubleshoot why the post isn't making it through (length,
characters, etc).

Thanks.

Final Replacement line in wpautop:
$pee = preg_replace('/<p>\s*?(' . get_shortcode_regex() . ')\s*<\/p>/s',
'$1', $pee); // don't auto-p wrap shortcodes that stand alone

Are you using any plugins which add custom shortcodes?

I'd add in a die(get_shortcode_regex()); and post that back to the list to  
try and work it out along with the above question..

But it does what the comment says, It replaces

<p>[gallery or other shortcode]</p> to the correct [shortcode] so that  
when the shortcode replaces it, it doesnt end up with extra <p> tags, eg:
<p><div class="myshortcode">...</p>

Find an opening paragraph tag and a minimum number of space characters

Match any shortcodes and save them to the first backreference.

Match space characters to a closing paragraph tag.

"s" is a modifier for dot-matches-all mode, meaning that preg_replace
should treat everything like it's one big line.

So replace everything that matches all that with the backreference
that just matches the get_shortcode_regex() pattern.

Thanks for the responses. The site I'm working on has several plugins but I
can reproduce the error on a local, clean installation w/o any plugins by
creating a post with the same content as the problem post on the site.

Both instances result in the same printout for die( get_shortcode_regex() );
Here it is:
\[(wp_caption|caption|gallery)\b(.*?)(?:(\/))?\](?:(.+?)\[\/\1\])?

----- Written 10 minutes later ------

After understanding what the preg_replace was doing (thanks to you) I
decided to look through the lengthy content for any random square brackets
(I didn't write the content).

I found a rouge line that started with [caption] and ended with [/caption]
but it did not appear to be generated by WP. I'm pretty sure the author
pasted it from some other engine. After deleting that line, the post comes
through with flying colors.

So, problem is resolved but I'm not sure if I understand the root of it.
Feel free to induldge if you wish.

Thanks again!

The [caption] shortcode is used for creating captions around images.
So if you use it in some wrong way, then yes, stuff between it will
probably get deleted.

On the Media Library, when items like .txt attachements are listed, they do
not have a small preview image to the left of them like images do, but I've
noticed a small txt file image in the 'Insert media' lightbox when uploading
a txt file.
Any chance an image representing the filetype for common files, zip, txt,
doc etc, could be shown next to the item in the 'Media Library' page?

It looks like this could already be on the cards, due to the icons in
'wp-includes/images/crystal/', but just wanted to check.

Message-ID: <2102fd710809190348r533d6781o1f5b9b8d0a0afefd@mail.gmail.com>

I'm attempting to use custom fields to handle post descriptions instead of
installing one of a thousand SEO plugins to do it, and while the theme
output mechanism was dead-simple for even a lightweight like me to put
together, I notice that whenever I add a custom field, the value that is
saved has slashes added to entities such as ", ', and &.

I'm already attribute_escape()ing the custom field output so that I can use
quotes and ampersands within it without it breaking my HTML.

It seems like WP should be stripping the slashes added by what I can only
assume is the Ajax mechanism for first adding the field to a post.
Subsquently editing and saving the value doesn't seem to add slashes
anymore.

Has anyone else noticed this?

Quick question:
Are you saying that the output from attribute_escape() ends up with ' "  
and & with slashes? Or that the raw output from get_post_meta() contains  
the slashes?

Glad I'm not the only one up at this hour. Here's a better rundown of it:

In a post, I add this as a custom field:
This, "that," and 'the other.'

After I click "Add Custom Field" and the field moves up to the list of
already added fields, it appears like this:
This, \"that,\" and \'the other.\'

Outputting that content as a meta field in my post -- utilizing
attribute_escape() to preserve the quotes -- I get this:
<meta name="description" content="This, \&quot;that,\&quot; and
\&#039;the other.\&#039;" />

Which is fine, of course, except for the slashes which were never
removed. I know I can easily strip slashes in my template file, and I
can also easily remove them from the custom field after the initial
adding of it.

However, it just seems like they shouldn't be present at all after
pressing "Add Custom Field." Subsequent edits of the custom field
doesn't generate any extraneous slashes, after all.

Ahhh.. ok yes, That makes more sense :)

Sounds like the adding of the post meta isnt deslashing it, What are you  
running? 2.6 or 2.7?

You rock dude. Definitely wanted to confirm it wasn't something unique
to my site. I want to post about adding descriptions to posts & pages
without using yet another plugin to do it, but didn't want to until I
figured out the slashes issue.

This is very weird...

Check out these two feeds:
http://www.callum-macdonald.com/feed/
http://www.callum-macdonald.com/feed/atom/

The dates are wrong on the atom feed. Not sure why or what's causing it.
I'll try to get some time to look into the code.

Here's my list of active plugins:
Akismet 2.1.4 
Contact Form ][ 2.0.13
Dunstan's Time Since 1.1
Google XML Sitemaps 3.0.3.3
Image Link jQuery Hack 0.1 (homegrown)
Lighter Menus 2.6.8
Log POST requests 0.1
Twitter for Wordpress 1.9
WordPress.com Stats 1.2.1
WP-Delegate-OpenID 0.1 (homegrown)
WP-Mail-SMTP 0.7
WP Drafts Menu 0.1 (homegrown)

I don't think any of the plugins are affecting the feeds, but I'll get
into it further.

Does anyone else have the same problem? Any suggested routes of
debugging?

Cheers - Callum.

Both are showing in GMT time, Maybe its your Feed reader not interp. the

Or maybe i've missed something entirely?

It's a couple of posts in particular, not all of them for some reason.

Post "FuseMail is Go"

It seems to be a series of posts but not all of them. I'll look into it
in a bit more detail this week hopefully.

Cheers - Callum.

What are you expecting to see here?

Both of those show that the post was published on the 30th of August at 
8:35am GMT

The atom one just adds that the content was updated last on the 3rd 
September at 4:18am GMT

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Admin UI Idea #3
Message-ID: <48D76F4F.1050707@konstruktors.com>

Hello,

Here is another WP admin UI idea (#3):
http://konstruktors.com/examples/wordpress-dashboard/03/

which is based 100% on the same markup as the original
http://konstruktors.com/examples/wordpress-dashboard/02/ but features:

* left side navigation which automatically keeps only the two latest nav
items open. Try clicking Content, then Manage, Comments. On opening
Comments the Content should collapse. This would help to minimize the
scrolling.

* 'move' cursor for widget boxes is displayed on hovering the widget's
header area. There is a small delay between the hover and when the
'move' cursor becomes visible. This helps avoid flickering when simply
moving across the page. Some people, however, may prefer to have instant
feedback.

* color ribbons for widget boxes.

* one theme color which could be one of the user settings.


The only working sections are:

* Dashboard:
  http://konstruktors.com/examples/wordpress-dashboard/03/

* Design > Widgets:
  http://konstruktors.com/examples/wordpress-dashboard/03/design.htm


What do you think?

Regards,
Kaspars

Message-ID: <5a1dad880809220445s435d03d9i5aee41cc66dc0adf@mail.gmail.com>

There are some really nice parts to the design:
Dashboard
Is a huge improvement on the current design, especially the drag-and-drop
functionality, as well as the 'Configure' button on hover. I would change
the 'move' cursor immediately, rather than having a wait on it. Also, 'Edit'
may be better than 'Configure' for most users.

Navigation
Your take on the navigation gives far more feedback to the user in terms of
the hover effect, as well as the different colour for the numbers.

My Tasks
I'm not really sure what that means, perhaps you mean user-chosen 'Quick
Links' to various parts of the admin panel they use most often. This would
be a nice touch, but possibly from a link in the header. Clicking a
'Quicklinks' link would open up a dropdown perhaps?

Widgets
Your interpretation of a widgets management page also has some nice touches,
like being able to see what the content of the widget would look like via
the opening of the widget; but I'm not sure how the layout would cope with
large numbers of widgets?

However, I think the best elements of your design should be introduced into
the current 2.7 design. I'm currently flicking between yours and the 2.7
version, and I personally rather the way 2.7 fills the screen completely,
making it feel more like a web-app. Also, the grey header bar in 2.7 could
become very useful, if it were to be organized better.

Overall, I think we should stick to the current design, and patch it with
the best bits of yours.

1) This is only an idea.

2) Remove 'max-width:60em;' from #soul to get 100% fluid.

Yes, 'my tasks' means quick links that are generated automatically (and
can be configured) based on the admin sections which the user visits the
most.

I have never clicked on anything other than items in the main menu of
the 2.5+ dashboard. These links would add 'switches' to the dasboard
which currently consist only of 'gauges'.

Each widget box would contain widget controls just like they currently
do.

On my blog I currently have 27 unused widgets. This would result in 27/4
= 7 rows (35px per row * 7 = 245px of vertical space) of widgets. Each
widget row could be easily reduced to 25px, which would allow placing 40
widgets in 250px.

I agree.

Yes, I agree with you. It's impressive. I have just a few suggestions 
about it:

    * The navigation does not work if javascript is disabled. I know
      this is a minor issue, but please keep it in mind, if you decide
      to adopt this interface as the new official Wordpress admin interface
    * In my humble opinion, the "Comments" group doesn't make sense; I'd
      prefer to see comments under "content"

Having said this, it is a very nice a clean design.

Good job,
dino.

Latest trunk remembers which menus you have open.  It doesn't close
all but the latest two, however.  That'd be interesting to user test.

I would love a patch that implements drag-and-drop and show/hide for
the dashboard.  For now, the patch would need to use our current box
styling to maintain consistency.  I'd like to see us move to something
like your box styling, however.

In general, I absolutely love that layout. Automattic people need to buy

Could the "Personal To-Do" box get explained in a little more detail?

This is very cool.  Personally, I would like it if the "configure"  
button only popped up after a brief pause, and only when mouse is over  
the box title, not the entire box.

Otherwise, these buttons are appearing and disappearing in rapid  
succession as I mouse over the page -- would get annoying fast.

Overall, this has some solid design.  Very nice work. :)

Seth, it would be a simple to-do list.

Plugins should be allowed to create widget boxes that can be placed
anywhere in the dashboard. And a to-do list could be such a plugin.

Message-ID: <161617690809221137u4a2ad1a3ub0bc2ef3408a1478@mail.gmail.com>

Can somebody explain to me how this makes the slightest bit of sense?

function get_the_tag_list( $before = '', $sep = '', $after = '' ) {
	return apply_filters( 'the_tags', get_the_term_list(0, 'post_tag',
$before, $sep, $after) );
}

function the_tags( $before = 'Tags: ', $sep = ', ', $after = '' ) {
	return the_terms( 0, 'post_tag', $before, $sep, $after );
}

Note that "the_terms" basically echos the results of get_the_term_list().


Suggested refactoring:

function the_tags( $before = 'Tags: ', $sep = ', ', $after = '' ) {
	echo get_the_tag_list($before, $sep, $after );
}

I've gotten about 25 of these over the weekend. They're all in
Russian, and appear to originate from 2 IPs (mostly from one of them
though). They're all from *.ertelecom.ru.

I simply deleted the first few, but then when they started coming in
more often I started spamming them. I'm only using Akismet. The
comments themselves tend to be pretty generic/non-related but they
certainly don't seem malicious. Anyone seen anything similar, or have
a solution for stopping them?

Simple advertising spam. Looks like a russian wireless networking

Message-ID: <E3B6F05D-5A74-4EAD-A25F-929E1D41CC23@striderweb.com>

Okay, I notice that wp-config.php file has a conditional that sets  
ABSPATH if it is not already set.  Since ABSPATH gets set in wp- 
load.php, under what circumstances is it ever set in wp-config?

Part of why I ask is that, as of WP 2.6, wp-config.php might be one  
directory up.  If ABSPATH is set there, it will be wrong, won't it?

Can that line be safely removed from wp-config.php, or is it genuinely  
necessary?

In the past, there was no wp-load.php, and as such, many people (myself
included) loaded wp-config.php directly to load WP. In this case, it
would not have been set.

In my opinion, it should be fine to remove it.

I am about to embark on my first  foray into Ajax and am looking for some
pointers about doing this within the context of WordPress.  What I want to
do is present a list to a user, let them reorder it using drag and drop, and
then store the new list order back in the database.  Should be pretty simple
- the widget side bar does this - it is just new to me.

 

So as a newbie in this area, are there any recommendations I should follow?
Does anyone have a simple example they can point me to?

 

Thanks,

 

Mike

You're looking for jQuery Sortable:

http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Sortables/sortable

It's been built-in since WP 2.6, and I use it the machine tag  
components of bSuite:

Message-ID: <20d17d690809231853pa9f08fbt20f387a68f80a765@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have created new columns in wp_comments and new input fields in a blog to
gather more data along with the comments (Gender, Age, etc.)

I have modified wp-comments-post.php to gather these new POST variables and
added the column names to  the $commentdata = compact() line

Currently my mods are not causing an error but obviously the new fields are
empty on save.

What else should I tweak beyond that? I have looked in the Codex and on the
Web for an answer but the search results are overwhelmed with generic
unrelated info.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction,

rather than modifying core files, you should probably use the  
'preprocess_comment' filter inside wp_new_comment() and check for a $_POST  
variable that you've added

However:
compact() takes a list of variables and compacts them into an array, As  
well as adding to that line, you need to also add the actual variable, eg,  
something similar to:
$comment_author_url   = trim($_POST['url']);
$comment_content      = trim($_POST['comment']);

So i miught use
$d_plugin = trim($_POST['d_plugin']);

compact('comment_post_ID', ...., 'd_plugin');

Sorry, Seems that filter will be useless, as wp_insert_comment()  
completely ignores any extra fields which you pass it, So you -will- need  
to modify core files and add the item to the compact() in  
wp_insert_comment() too (line 700ish of wp-includes/comment.php)

Hi Marie-Lynn,
It is possible to do this as DD32 outlines without modifying core
files but it takes a little bit of work so if you're not going to be
upgrading in the future (you should upgrade in the future), this
probably isn't worth it.

1. Copy wp_comments_post.php from your root directory and place it
into your theme's directory
2. Open up your theme's comments.php and change the FORM action from
<?php echo get_option('siteurl'); ?>/wp-comments-post.php to <?php
bloginfo('stylesheet_directory'); ?>/wp-comments-post.php
3. Copy the wp_new_comment() and wp_insert_comment() functions from
comment.php and paste them (with new names) into your theme's
functions.php file (or your own plugin if you want).
4. In your new version of wp_new_comment(), change the line that says
$comment_ID = wp_insert_comment($commentdata); to $comment_ID =
your_new_insert_comment($commentdata);
5. In your new version of wp_insert_comment(), make the necessary
changes needed in the code/sql.
6. Go back to you copy of wp_comments_post.php (the one you put in
your theme directory) and change line 71 to call your new version of
wp_insert_comment() that you created in step 3 and modified in step 5.

While this is not a "quick" solution to implement, it will allow you
to upgrade WP in the future without having to modify comments.php each
time.
Again, it's a lot of work for what might be a little trade off
(creating the new file / functions v. updating comments.php every time
you upgrade). It would be worth it to me though just so I don't have
to change the WP core code.

Oh, and one disclaimer: the above code probably has syntax errors in
it (and possibly a logical one) as I did test the process tonight, but
recalled it from a similar procedure I did earlier this year.

Yeah it does. :-(

But then it would have to magically guess the field names.

It looks like we need an action in wp_insert_comment which passes the ID 
of the new comment and the $commentdata to the action handlers so they 
can do things based on that - like add extra info to the database.

That way you can collect and process the data on pre_process_comment and 
insert it on the new action hook.

How does that sound?

You might hook to preprocess_comment and then to comment_post. At  
least that worked when I wrote a plugin to allow private comments  
(haven't used or updated it recently). Here's the relevant function:

class bsuite_privatecomments {
	function preprocess_comment( $comment ) {
		$comment['privatecomment'] = !is_null( $_REQUEST['privatecomment'] );
		if($comment['privatecomment'])
			add_filter('pre_comment_approved', create_function('$a', 'return  
\'private\';'), 1);
			if($this->options['notify'])
				add_action('comment_post', array(&$this, 'notify'));
	
		return( $comment );
	}
}
add_action('preprocess_comment', array(&$this, 'preprocess_comment'),  
1);

Inside a function like that you could probably do an

add_action('comment_post', create_function('$comment_id, $approved',  
'do stuff with the $_REQUEST['var'] and $comment_id'));

That'd give you both the comment ID and your request vars without  
having to modify any core files.


Here's that old plugin:

Hi,

I don't know if this has been discussed before but I noticed recently on all
of my WordPress sites (all running 2.6.2) the permalink sample does not pop
up when creating a new page (under the title).  It still pops up when
creating a new post.  The ajax response from admin-ajax is empty when
creating a new page.  Anyone else have this issue?  It works fine when I
save a page and go back to edit it, but this way is slightly more annoying.
Thanks,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Inline Documentation Effort Updates
Message-ID: <48DAE90F.4060503@santosj.name>

The conclusion of the April discussion on how I hate that no one has 
stepped forward to help out on the Inline documentation effort was that 
I would continue and wait to see if anything else happened. This is an 
update of the inline documentation effort and what has happened in the 
four months, since that last thread.

To rehash what the inline documentation effort is, it is to push 
community members into helping out writing inline documentation for 
WordPress in order to complete it quickly or faster than one person can 
accomplish at least. The point also is to ensure that future functions 
are included with inline documentation negating the need for another 
grassroots effort in the future.

Well, happy to say that all but two files in wp-includes directory have 
incomplete documentation. Two people have stepped forward to help with 
the effort in completing both formatting.php (which is a pain, so I'm 
happy I didn't have to work on it) and general-template.php. Scott H and 
Peter Westwood worked on those two files respectively. Not the masses I 
had hoped for, but those two were able to complete a large portion of 
the files, so I think it is all good.

Most of the new functions that are added also have inline documentation. 
Not all, mind you, but enough that I think the effort was successful in 
convincing enough people to put the effort into adding inline 
documentation. Also, the functions that were added without inline 
documentation didn't take more than an hour to complete the inline 
documentation, so I don't think I'm upset about that.

The entire WordPress base directory has complete inline documentation. 
Most of the files in wp-admin has file block level inline documentation 
and all should have file block level inline documentation by the time 
WordPress 2.7 is released. This will mean that any PHPXRef site out 
there will actually have descriptions for files on the right hand side. 
It also means that a lot of the wp-admin functions are documented. Not 
the wp-admin/includes functions.

The only parts that are missing are a few files in wp-admin are missing 
function level inline documentation, Most of wp-admin/includes files are 
missing inline documentation. The functions that can be used by plugin 
or theme developers have priority, but that progress is only halfway 
complete. That directory just isn't that high on the priority list, but 
if anyone wants to document those files, they may well do so.

Alas, the final pieces for the inline documentation effort is in 
link-template.php and post-template.php (which I'm still might complete 
before the week is over). So for WordPress 2.7, you will be able to look 
up most functions and have inline documentation for the parameters and 
descriptions for what the functions do.

Just so you know, the inline documentation effort is never complete. 
There are grammar mistakes, documentation inaccuracies, and well the 
inline documentation could always be improved and expanded.

So it has been a year, but I think the inline documentation has been a 
success (October 2007 - September 2007). I hope that if anyone spots a 
mistake, that they correct it and submit the patch to the WordPress 
Trac. I'm pretty much done with the effort, so if anyone wants to 
continue, please don't ask, just go ahead and do it. If not, then I'll 
probably take it up again sometime next year.

Hi,

I just tried to install wordpress MU in my company intranet, but i could 
not login with intranet URL.  (eg: https://blogs/).

After installation, i tried to login as admin, but i am getting the same 
login page again.

I am currently debugging the issue.  Is it a bug?

Regards,
Senthil

I just debugged this, and found that cookies are not set, when we login 
in intranet url.  However, the problem doesnt arise, when we install the 
blog in internet and login.

It seems, some where, the http header is output before the cookie is 
being set.

Great work so far, Jacob. I for one would support a motion not to
allow new patches into trunk without associated documentation. The
best and easiest time to add it is when the code's first being
written, not a year down the line.

Second what Benedict said : tremendous effort documenting all these
files, Jacob, and I'm sure in the end it could prove even more useful
than "just" for PHPXref sites.

As far as I can tell, the core-team has already adopted writing propre
documentation to new methods. This should be pushed to patch providers
too - and thus, maybe included in the Codex's Reporting Bugs page, so
that the doc is updated along with the code.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs#Patching_Bugs

Thanks a lot to Jacob, and all those involved !

I think WPMU expects a more fully formed hostname, which needs at least 
two parts. So you'd need to name your site something like 
'blogs.localnet' instead of just 'blogs' (or better yet: 
'blogs.myrealdomain.com'). This can be a pain if you don't have internal 
DNS already set up. But I always say that it's worth it to set up DNS 
for your office network anyways.

Thanks dougal.  But in our company, all intranet urls are like https://blogs,
https://wiki .  Infact, we have a huge corporate blog implementation of
wordpress that hosts around 15,000 blogs inside our company..  the url is
like https://ch1blogs/blogs .

I am currently upgrading the code base to the latest version...  i deployed
a customized version of wordpress around two years back when wordpress was
in its nightly build and now i am redoing all customizations in to plugins.
We need to maintain the same url after upgradation..

It would be helpful, if i know in which part of the code this issues
exists..

Subject: [wp-hackers] How do you manage your plugin development?
Message-ID: <20080925102721.7ce848fd@montecarlo.grandprix.int>

I have been developing two plugins for a while now, no shameless
plug ;), and I have been wondering how other developers are
managing their plugins.
I'm thinking about bug tracking, project management etc.

Personally I'm using the following:
I run Linux and use Eclipse for writing my plugins. I created a local
git repository in which I do my development and when I have a release
ready I copy the contents of the git repo into the trunk of svn repo
@ wordpress, create a new tag and commit the svn repo.

I have a forum where people can report bugs, but people also report
bugs in the comment section on my blog. I usually fix the bug within a
few days. And don't really keep track of them.

For project management, it's big word for what I'm doing, I use
OpenOffice. I just have a document in which I set my goals for next
releases.
I started a release schedule just a few days ago and I put the dates in
Sunbird.

Dougal is correct.  Will Norris recently covered this issue:

	http://willnorris.com/2008/09/wordpress-mu-in-a-development-environment

The two second version: WPMU includes the hostname when setting a  
cookie (WP doesn't), which requires an embedded dot (part of the HTTP  
cookie spec) to work.  Meaning http://blogs.mycompany/ will work, but http://blogs/ 
  won't.

* bugzilla.redhat.com (eventually)
* project management was that we had an internal project that needed 
these plugins, so my PM bugged me until I got 'em done :P

I've got some git repos up on fedorapeople, but haven't formalized 
anything yet b/c one is WPMU-compatibility mod of an existing plugin, 
and I'm still need to coordinate w/ the original authors.

Something I've done in a variety of web apps is to include a direct link 
to the form for bug submission.

Most folks I know are using trac for a more integrated approach; I just 
end up using bugzilla + text file/internal tracking tools.

Thank you jacob for all your hard work!

I have just got my phpdoc sites up and running again and moved them on 
to a host with a bit more bandwidth that they had before.

I have added bbPress and BackPress into the mix too.

The root of the site is http://phpdoc.ftwr.co.uk/ and it is set to 
automattically update every 30 minutes as things change.

Cheers

Awesome. Still dreaming of http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/ though (i've
been using a local phpxref since the site went down, but I can't link
to it in IRC etc).

Also, is it too much to dream of a 303 from http://phpxref.wordpress.org/?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Proposal: standardize plugin-data path
Message-ID: <38674CBC-BD8D-440D-B2D8-CC3639A8C7C8@striderweb.com>

Hi --

There are a number of plugins that themselves have user-changeable  
files.  I'm not talking about ones where you edit the file to set  
options, but things like Spam Karma that have plugins of their own, or  
my own Pull-Quotes plugin that allows you to customize the style  
files, or caching and backup plugins that create files of their own.

We also now have an established auto-update system which, upon update,  
blows away anything in a plugin's folder, including any files that may  
have been added or changed.

I propose we establish an official location (changeable via CONSTANT  
of course) for plugins to put their custom data that should _not_ be  
so easily wiped out on update.  The default we set could be as simple  
as /wp-content/plugin-data.  Thus myplugin would use /wp-content/ 
plugin-data/myplugin

I know plugin authors can just set that directory to anything they  
like, but I generally think it's a good idea to standardize such  
things.  Makes things a bit easier for plugin authors to establish an  
alternative location for things if there's a set standard.

What say ye all?

Stephen

P.S. -- This came up in the course of wanting to allow users of the  
aforementioned pull-quotes plugin to set a custom directory for the  
pull-quote styles.  It would be great to have something like  
WP_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR and WP_PLUGIN_DATA_URL, or even just  
WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/plugin-data'

Yeah, I'd love to have a reliable or even better an official phpxref. It's
by far my most used docs.

*wonders if the mispelling of "automatically" was on purpose* :-P

Also, Jacob, thanks for all your work on this. It's really great to be
able to have developer documentation for the code and it's made creating
plugins, patches and, really, everything much easier. My only regret is
that I wasn't able to help and I apologise for that.

I'm pretty sure this is a simple one...

I am using WP for a site that is pretty traditional navigation. I'm using
pages for the navigation and I'm using child pages to generate the
subnavigation within an area.

How do I get the Parent page so that I can put it above my subnav. For
example, in my About Us section I have 5 child pages. Each child page
displays the same subnav and above the subnav I want it to say "About Us". I
tried using wp_title(''); ?> but it returns the current child page. What
should I use to return the current Parent page?

thanks.

Oh yeah, Ryan Boren has added http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/ and 
http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/tags/2.6.2/ and I suspect that when 2.7 
comes out, that will also be added. Peter Westwood also bought his sites 
back up for more than just WordPress, which is pretty cool.

I don't want anyone to feel back for not helping. I actually learned a 
lot and had some fun doing it (well, I wouldn't have put as much effort 
in it if it wasn't at least a little bit fun). I think it is fine that 
the community are writing patches that includes inline documentation and 
I think it is great that the core commit team developers are adding 
inline documentation for new functions. It is absolutely fantastic, that 
the majority of the core team is writing inline documentation. That was 
mostly the whole point of the effort in the first place. The theory was 
that no one felt like adding inline documentation, because inline 
documentation didn't exist and if it did exist, then more people will 
write inline documentation. It appears the theory was correct. I like to 
feel that I had something to do with it, but I'm sure with the ratio of 
code to comments, that the core team was already doing so before I started.

The contention I have, has always been quality assurance, which when I 
joined the community WordPress had very little. Or at least very little 
that could be seen. That has changed, not because of me, but because of 
the community and Automattic. I applaud that as a PHP developer, I don't 
have to feel dirty for using WordPress, when there are supposed "better" 
developed alternatives out there. You know, with inline documentation 
and unit tests. WordPress has both of those and as an user of WordPress, 
I'm very happy of the gains WordPress has made because of the community.

All open source projects have problems with motivating community members 
to take action. PHP, the language has the same problem. Well, they have 
more people working on the developer manual of the language than 
actually writing inline documentation, but I mean they could use more 
people writing test cases for extensions. There is a long list of people 
on the http://codex.wordpress.org/Inline_Documentation to thank that 
helped out a great deal. Most of them in the past and several in the 
present. I predict more to come in the future.

As a developer, I also enjoy that I can look at the WordPress source or 
phpDocumentor sites and get API documentation for WordPress functions. I 
might have documented a lot of functions, but I'll be damned if I can 
remember them all. Using PDT, has also gained some enjoyment, since it 
displays the short description and parameter information (sadly the long 
description is not shown). I just kind of wished that it existed when I 
started writing plugins, but at least those that start writing plugins 
for WordPress 2.7 won't have as hard of a time finding functions.

If anyone wishes to help there is a ticket devoted to the mistakes in 
the documentation for each milestone, named "Inline documentation 
corrections..." or search for the keyword "phpdoc" find that ticket and 
submit the patch. Doesn't matter if it only changes one word or changes 
the entire function level phpdoc block.

We as a community need to help out with the quality assurance of 
WordPress, well some of us do. I think what you do, Ryan, is great, so 
keep doing it. No apology is needed. I'm actually more mad at the early 
developers for not writing the inline documentation themselves. What it 
would have saved if the effort gained support in 0.70, 1.0, but it 
solves nothing blaming those who are gone.

The next step I think is improving the level of testing automation, 
which is boring, fun, and a larger task to complete than inline 
documentation. Thankfully, there are already several people working on 
it already (http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-tests), so helping with 
that will also go a long way.

Actually, post-template.php is halfway complete, so I'm pretty sure I'll 
be finishing that one up before the end of this weekend. I'm still not 
sure about link-template.php, but it would be a shame to have one file 
just hanging out there all alone. I'm thinking I might finish it up, but 
I won't be mad, if someone completes it before I do.

Subject: [wp-hackers] database columns
Message-ID: <1222419665.19399.10.camel@meleeisland>

Hello everybody (first mail!!)

don't know if this is the right place for asking, but  I didn't find any
developer forum or ml.

so,here si my question:

I have a webcomic, hosted in a free-service. I would like to buy some
web space and domain. I will install wordpress but I need to migrate all
of my old strips to the new blog. 

My old blog isn't a wordpress one, so my idea was to writing a script
(actually in python) for walking through my harddisk, getting stats from
image files, ad building the wp_post database.

I've encountered some difficult reverse engineering the wp_post columns.

Is there any explanation of what they exactly mean?

I only need to fill the database with, post title, date (I read the
creation time from the file stats) and stop. 

But doing it in this way it says me that "the column xxx has no default
value"


I found this:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Table:_wp_posts

but it doesn't explain everything...

if someone understand my spaghetti-english ( :-) ), can some one help
me?

Regards 
Segolas

Your best bet:
Create a post in the way you want, Then replace the differing details from  
each strip in the SQL you use.

There are some descriptions somewhere, but taking a real database row and  
duplicating it will be much quicket IMO.

Hi all,
First post to the list, been lurking for a while.

Just a quick question: Does anyone run 2.7 on a public blog yet?

Cheers,

I do: http://dd32.id.au/ I'm pretty sure http://ma.tt/ does too

A few days ago i did a version-scrounge of about 80,000 public WP blogs,  
300 (~0.3%) were running 2.7, about 35%(27k) were 2.6, and about 12% were  
not WP blogs(or had hidden their version) -- I'll have a blog post on that  
in a few weeks when i collate it together a bit more.

Running trunk(2.7) on a live blog is running a thin line, many things do  
not work all the time, some things only work half the time, but you get  
access to the new functionality that has been introduced very quickly :)

(Oh, I also compared to Plugin developers (taking their author url and  
plugin homepage from wordpress.org), 5% were running 2.7, 60% running 2.6,  
and 20% on 2.5, just as a bit of contrast)

Cool! I'm considering it actually, and I don't mind broken links in the
admin area or anything, but actual posting and commenting functionality is
of course necessary. :)

I'm running r8988, only about 2-3 times since 2.6 did trunk not work  
for me. And usually it gets posted here when trunk breaks.

Yup, "<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 2.7-hemorrhage" />" :)

I've been using trunk on my blog for a long while, and although I don't get
a large readership (only just reopened it), I haven't really found any
show-stopping bugs in trunk, so I'm pretty happy to use and test it.

Testing trunk on a development blog is okay, but to get real-world testing
out of a product you have to use it every day, so having the live blog run
off trunk seems like a good idea if you're willing to take the risk and make
lots of backups!

I backup my data before every SVN update, using a cron job - shameless
plug<http://blog.hempsworth.com/33/automated-backups-and-svn-updates/>-
especially if you have Dreamhost.

Yeah, The only time that trunk has broken for me these last few weeks was  
the initial admin redesign (there were a few bugs), The HTTP API had a bug  
in it on my server, I implemented threaded comments the night it went into  
trunk, and some parameters got changed around overnight so my comments  
broke.. But thats stable now..

I would say, Make a backup, and go for it, but be ready to switch to 2.6  
if you notice any major issues. If you've got SSH access to the server,  
using SVN and issueing a switch to 2.6 should only take a few minutes.

Keeping backups of your database, easy with the 'mysqldump' SSH command,
means that you can just revert to the old, working, version. Although
switching to 2.6 is a safe way to get yourself out of trouble, if
'yesterdays' trunk was working for you, its just as good to revert to that.

Theres no real database changes that i'm aware of.. Or at least, None  
which will make a 2.7->2.6 switch loose data/functionality (But like i  
said, backup allways, even if I do not make backups, You should!)
Of course, I could be wrong, If I am, I'd love to be proved wrong :)

Obviously all of this can be done manually by FTP and phpMyAdmin, but it
just takes longer, and it requires actually *remembering* to do it! :P

Why not set up a nightly cron script that emails the file out? A gmail
account for db backups is pretty useful.

I'm currently running r8976 on my personal site. I svn up it usually
every other day or so.

As for DB backups, well, I have a few, but I don't back it up too
often. I do a mysql dump whenever the site tells me that an upgrade is
required after I svn up the thing, but I haven't needed any of them
anytime recently. Not too worried about it, I can always just revert
back to whatever manually using the schema. Hey, it's a personal blog,
it's not exactly critical or anything. :)

Living on the edge, man. ;-)

Pardon me, using wp_upload_dir() is a bad idea due to the year/month
thing. Use WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/uploads/your_plugin_name' instead.

It is actually a lot easier to create a wp import file from your data and
then import it, than to get all of the data right for a direct db insert.

As suggested, create your sample in the wordpress admin, then export it.

Now look through that XML file for the structure needed, and build your
conversion routine to replicate that structure from your existing data.

You can use the function:
plugins_url()

example:
for images:
plugins_url('/simple_banner/includes/farbtastic/farbtastic.png')

for JS is this better:
wp_enqueue_script( 'farbtastic',
plugins_url('/simple_banner/includes/farbtastic/farbtastic.js'),
array('jquery'), '1.2' );

for css:
wp_enqueue_style( 'farbtastic',
plugins_url('/simple_banner/includes/farbtastic/farbtastic.css'),
array(), '1.2', 'screen' );

Liebe Gr?sse

Jerry's right - creating an import file is definitely the way to do
it. You can get your export file by going to the Manage->Export tab
(after you've created a post or two so you have some example data).

Jacob (and helpers)

Late on this, but I wanted to say:
- sorry I totally missed your call for help back then (prob' had my  
head deep in WPhone with Viper and Zamoose at the time)...
- I had indeed noticed the nice coverage in trunk and wanted to say  
thanks and good job. It's looking great.

alredy saw that link, but it describes database's tables, not tables' 
columns.

and following the way of  replicating a known row detail it's a little 
tricky. I'm doing it, but there is a column named "post_parent" wich 
value change for every post i do and I don't understed what it is...

It's my idea of website style,
But in any theme folder you have templates like index.php, single.php 
...... how must i do when i have in any folder template who have same 
name, how must I do?

posts can be "child pages" of other posts (same with pages, which is great
for navigation and structured page groups)

this is a crude hierarchy, mostly used to associate media pieces with their
story.

post_parent is a foreign key of the parent_id of the post's parent. 0 if
there is no parent.

I agree with the standardization/guidelines effort. It's always a good  
thing.
But I'll detail something below, in case it can help someone else (or  
if someone has suggestions for a better approach).

Our WP plugins (for the http://praizedmedia.com/ API) allow theme  
designers to overwrite the custom templates that come bundled with our  
tools with their own custom versions.

To allow them to do so without running into issues where they'd  
overwrite their changes when upgrading to a newer version of the  
plugin, what I've used the following technique:
1) Designer creates a *plugin_name* (EG: praized-community) directory  
in their theme (provided people rarely switch or overwrite their theme  
dir).
2) They just copy the templates they want to customize from our plugin  
dir to the dedicated dir mentioned above within their theme and modify  
them as needed.
3) On page load, I check in *theme_dir*/*plugin_name*/ 
*targeted_template* for a template override and use it instead of our  
if found.

This way, their changes do not get overwritten when they upgrade our  
plugins.
And since we use the concept of template functions and fragments, they  
also gain the new features automatically when updating, except in the  
templates they chose to customize (usually interface containers, not  
the *meat* of the output, which is in template fragments they rarely  
customize).

Just thought I'd share. :)

Cheers,

Stephane Daury

Seems to me that the safest place to do this would be
wp_upload_dir().'/your_plugin_name' . The upload directory doesn't
have to be limited to uploaded files. The tinyMCE stuff already puts
it's cached JS files there too.

I was just about to note that. The uploads directly is widely known to  
be a data storage area. I do a lot of rsync maintenance for remote  
WordPress sites, so uploads/your_plugin_name is definitely very  
appropriate. I think that WP E-Commerce uses the uploads directory for  
one example.

This was very timely as I am working on loading some plugin specific
Javascript today.  However, I cannot for the life of me figure out why this
doesn't work:

function swimteam_admin_head()
{
    //  Load CSS
    swimteam_head_css() ;

    //  Load plugin Javascript
    wp_enqueue_script('portlet',
        plugins_url(plugin_basename(dirname(__FILE__)
        . '/js/portlet.js')), array('jquery', 'interface')) ;
    var_dump(plugins_url(plugin_basename(dirname(__FILE__)
        . '/js/portlet.js'))) ;
}

The output of the var_dump() shows up at the top of the rendered page and
the path is correct so I know my function is executing but there isn't a
<script> tag reference to either "interface" (which is a dependency) or my
plugin specific code in the resulting HTML.

Why wouldn't something which was enqueued show up in the output?

Thanks,

Mike

Salut Olivier --

Am I understanding correctly:  You want different pages on your site  
to use different themes?

I think you would basically have to modify the "single.php" and  
"style.css" file from each of those themes and make one giant theme  
out of them.  Create nonPro565-Single.php, retro-macos-Single.php,  
etc., and nonPro565-style.css, retro-macos-style.css.  Give all of  
these pages a header that will give it a particular name within the  
dropdown in the Page Edit screen.

Sorry I don't have time to be more thorough.  Hope that helps you  
out. :)

Stephen

If you're hooking that to the admin_head action hook, then that's too
late. admin_print_styles and admin_print_scripts happen before
admin_head, so the enqueue is too late to do anything.

Hook to admin_init instead.

Otto -- Could you please explain the "year/month thing"?

Obviously the existence of wp_upload_dir() indicates that path can  
change, and is not necessarily within WP_CONTENT_DIR.

Thus, if wp_upload_dir() automatically appends the date, shouldn't  
there be a way to prevent this?  wp_upload_dir(false) or somesuch?

By the year/month thing, I mean that the upload dir automatically
appends the year/month folder names if that option is enabled.
However, that just shows what I get for not paying attention.
wp_upload_dir() returns an array, not a string. And that array
includes both the directory with and without those folders attached.

So, the *real* correct answer is:

$wud = wp_upload_dir();
$your_upload_dir = $wud['basedir'] . '/your_plugin_name';

:)

This is not a bug. You have a plugin that is broken or malfunctioning.
Something related to "wp_lightboxJS_add_quicktag".

Disable that plugin.

+1 for using the uploads dir for storing plugin files. After we were
hacked we had to lock down the permissions on everything but that
directory, which is what basically everyone should be doing anyway.
Seeing as it's the only directory that MUST be writable by the server
it will be the place least likely to require loosening permissions to
use.

That said, we also had to turn off all .php execution from inside that
directory because the damn hackers kept uploading image files full of
php code and using them as a backdoor, so its worth keeping in mind
that such directories might have limited power because they are so
open.

James,
I was having the same trouble you were and was able to successfully reverse
engineer the process. I've written a post that describes the basics for what
I did and what I think you are wanting to do:

Let me know if that helps,

Guys,

Does anyone have a simple way of testing theme (de)activation, just
like the 'activate_pluginname' hook?

A theme's functions.php could test for deactivation by knowing it's
own theme name and watching for the switch_theme action. When it gets
triggered to switch to something else, there you go.

A theme should be able to notice when it gets activated by testing for
both the cases of (isset($_GET['activated']) && $parent_file ==
"themes.php").

Hi all,
I was having a sift through the new navigation in trunk, and I noticed that
the 'Media -> Upload new' link actually takes you to the upload popup as a
main page, rather strange behaviour really. Is it intended to open up in a
lightbox as in the Post/Page editor page at some point?

No, it will open in a normal page, working on that at the moment. 
Perhaps try again in a few hours/tonight :)

I've read Ozh's post, but it only deals with adding a meta box to the post
page. It doesn't cover how you can add meta boxes to your own plugin pages.

I had the switch_theme test on deactivation but was hoping that I had
missed something obvious and more simple. Thanks for the reply Otto.

Message-ID: <5a1dad880809261823k1c0293afy70be005156238754@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
I'm reworking an existing plugin to add extra features, and I thought I'd
give it a spring clean whilst I'm at it - adding inline documentation and
removing all the nasty tables from the admin panel. To make the options page
look pretty again I'm obviously going to use some CSS, but I'd rather
include a CSS file than have inline CSS out of personal preference.

I know you can enque JS, and I was reading that you can also enque CSS files
since 2.6 - is this the option for me? If so, how would I go about including
'style.css' on my options page, if the stylesheet resides in my plugins
folder.

Thanks,

wp_enqueue_style(), parameters are the same as wp_enqueue_script() except
tag "screen" onto the end to specify the CSS medium.

Seriously, this UI is getting ridiculous. 3 links for Dashboard, 3
links or buttons to add a new post, 3 links for user profile, and in
order to maximize the number of click you have to do, some links even
disappear depending on the page you're on. Some links are duplicated
all over the place, while you have to search and dig for others. How
usable, unconfusing and newbie friendly is this??

Why is the search in the sidebar, at bottom? It doesn't look good there, 
not to mention having to scroll
all the way down there to use it. I'd rather have it back up top again, 
where the drop down menu that
doesn't work, is at.

And for some reason, the "Comments" link is in the sidebar all by 
itself, with nothing
else for it... I'm sorry, but I'll have to agree with Ozh about some of 
these changes. Don't get me wrong
though, I'm sure it's just some bugs and tweaking that will need done of 
course, just currently, everything
is all over the place.

What if add new post/page where moved as a drop down like "My Account"

Thank for the pointer, admin_init() worked perfectly.

I have used phpHtmlLib (http://phphtmllib.newsblob.com) for a number of
years for form processing and some of the other widgets.  The phpHtmlLib
library has a nice feature where you construct a page by building up a page
as an object and then render it once it is built.  I like this approach
because things like CSS and Javascript references can be determined very
late in the logic and added to the object and are then rendered in the
proper order.

Mike

PS:  If anyone is interested, I have a version of the 2.x thread of
phpHtmlLib which loads into WordPress as a plugin so the form processor and
other widgets can be used within WordPress.

If you're hooking that to the admin_head action hook, then that's too
late. admin_print_styles and admin_print_scripts happen before
admin_head, so the enqueue is too late to do anything.

Hook to admin_init instead.

Message-ID: <006401c920b9$65518650$2ff492f0$@com>

Is anyone running WordPress on SourceForge?  I have had a WordPress
installation for a while to document the development process of a plugin I
am working on and it has always had some oddities but now a lot of stuff
doesn't work and it isn't obvious to me why.  SourceForge recently updated
PHP from 4.3.8 to 5.2.6 and changed some of the ways you access the web and
shell services.  I have never been able to get Akismet to work, it tells me
it can't communicate with the Wordpress.com API.  Now I can't upload images
either even though I have set the permissions to the upload directory to
777.  Very odd - anyone else run into this?  If so, how did you solve it?  I
am think of taking my site elsewhere and simply setting up a redirect on
SourceForge if I can't figure this out.

 

Mike

I had at one point in time setup WordPress on sourceforge for a project I am
working on.  I had no end to troubles running it there.  First Akismet won't
work because SourceForge does not allow outbound connections to be made from
their hosting accounts.  I had to to install a Cpatcha plugin to prevent
getting spam.  Second in order to get uploads working (following their
directions) you have to create a directory in the /tmp directory for use of
uploading.  Then I had to create a symlink from this /tmp directory to the
uploads directory.

In the end I just put a redirect that redirects to a subdomain that I setup
on my own domain.  In addition to that the sourceforge hosting is
increadibly slow.  They shift the high volume sites to their better boxes
and push the low volume sites to less powerful over used boxes.

It's not done yet.  :-)  There, we knew that was coming.  The entire
header is going to be redone to reduce the amount of vertical space it
takes.

Search might end up at the top of the nav, or maybe somewhere back in
the header.  I think the plan is to test it a few different ways and
do a poll as well.

Wireframes and a blog post explaining it all forthcoming.

To avoid emails like this in future, perhaps Automattic could let us know
about the changes *prior* to them being submitted to trunk. Maybe this is
pushing it, but a roadmap/wireframes of the intended finished design could
be published?! :P
A bit more transparency and a little less surprise might make our lives
easier. :)

Indeed, we are remiss in taking so long to get everything tidied up
and out the door.  This stuff has been presented and discussed at
several WordCamps but hasn't transitioned into a more accessible form.
 Annotated wireframes and some blog posts should be out as soon as I
can get everyone back from the WordCamps. :-)  And once the first
round of the visual design is done, that will be released as well.

For those hitting the WordCamps today, Matt will be talking about the
new design at the Utah WordCamp and Jane at the Portland WordCamp.

Message-ID: <5dc2163e0809280011g7b95315eld57cef787c0cad39@mail.gmail.com>

With the discussion this last week of methods of backing up the database, I
decided to make some more progress on my plugin to backup WordPress files to
Amazon S3.  Right now, I've got it backing up the config, the database,
themes and plugins (I'm going to add uploads as soon as I figure out a
problem I'm having).  It uploads a zip archive with everything you select.
I'd love to have some testers before I upload it to the public on
wordpress.org.

Requirements for this very early test version:
Linux box with mysqldump (I'll work around this requirement later)
PHP5
An Amazon S3 account (obviously)
The ability and knowhow to create your own bucket in Amazon S3 and
find/download files that have been uploaded.

Does it support scheduled daily backups onto s3, by any chance?

Yes, it uses wp-cron to do daily, weekly, or monthly backups.

Count me in.  I already use S3 to back up my local dev machine, it'd be 
nice to be bale to back up my live site too...

I wrote this up because I thought somebody might find it useful. It's
an explanation of how to modify your theme to support the new comments
functionality in WordPress 2.7. Threaded comments, paging, AJAX
replies, the new styles, the works. When I went looking for this
information, I didn't find it anywhere, so I thought I'd write up what
I found.

Obviously, it only describes the current trunk, but hey, still useful,
especially for theme authors:

Hey all,

I make calls to wp_redirect() in my plugins and it usually is all good.

Unfortunately, a user is running into problems where the redirect  
header is just printed on screen and fails.

Output buffering is on and all is good with the default theme on his  
server, or a fresh copy of his theme on my workstation (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/thematic 
).

Any idea what in a theme could make wp_redirect fail?

Isn't it rewriting the function? Maybe somewhere in his functions.php ?

Good point. I forgot wp_redirect is in pluggable.php.

I'll get him to send me a zipped up copy of his exact theme and will  
double-check (though I doubt it's the case).

Thanks for the suggestion Joost.

Hey guys,

I'm just passing a quick ping.

My boss told me he's requested two plugin repo accounts for Praized  
(praized-community and praized-tools) a little while ago.
He had originally misunderstood the fact that we needed one account  
per plugin, and our praized repo got approved, but not the above yet.

I'm about to release v1.5 of our plugins, and I'd love to do this on  
wp-plugins.org, in time for WordCamp Toronto this weekend.

Any chance I could get a status update? Maybe even a little boost? ;)

It'd be really very much appreciated.

Thanks a bunch.

Stephane

I think it's useful that it can be rewritten. For example, as different
web servers handle redirection differently, it could be useful to
override that function. Or as part of a caching strategy it might be
useful to process redirects. I've used it in a couple of plugins on WPMU
to redirect to our custom login page and so on.

Cheers - Callum.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress as a full stack web framework
Message-ID: <FC81CBE5-6BF3-4EE4-A99E-5F519CCB31BC@tekartist.org>


I don't mean to spam you guys with our plugin releases, but one of  
them is (to me) a great examples of something I'm thinking about  
presenting in WordCamps: "Using WordPress as a full-stack web  
framework".

Our Praized Community plugin does not extend WP as much as it uses it  
as a container for us to be able provide an easy to deploy, powerful,  
extensible and very much supported solution.

Here are the mandatory plugin links and a bit more info:
http://blogs.praized.com/product/just-in-time-for-praized-at-wordcamp-toronto-praized-plugins-added-to-wordpressorg/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/praized-community/
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/praized-tools/

I started by making a PHP lib to interact with our XML/JSON API, but  
when it came down to rolling something anyone could install, the WP  
plugin framework proved to be the ideal solution. We do also provide  
MT plugins, for market reasons, but they're more or less ports of what  
we achieve through WP first and foremost.

I've never been much of a framework guy in the past, preferring to  
develop my own codebases, but since I've started developing for WP,  
it's pretty much now turned into my full time job. :)

Anyway, the point is to ask if you think there's value and potentially  
interest in me developing a presentation along those lines.

Let me know what you think.

Cheers,

Stephane Daury

That'd make sense.

On a separate note, the user wasn't rewriting wp_redirect(), but I've  
got a copy of his theme and will nail what was up.

I'l post if relevant.

On another note, Callum: are you still in Montreal?
