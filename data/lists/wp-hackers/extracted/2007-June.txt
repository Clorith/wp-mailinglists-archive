Well, it looks like the issue was with balance_tags, which both of the
people (Nazgul and I) had off, apparently.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Post slug bug
Message-ID: <8ff7155b0705312100v3672deaexd3d1d457da988348@mail.gmail.com>

Given the title "?Qu? es un blog?" i get this permalink,

http://defmay.com/2007/05/14/%c2%bfque-es-un-blog/

instead of

http://defmay.com/2007/05/14/que-es-un-blog/

It seems like the slug is not recognizing the opening "?", it never
happened before... running 2.2 stable.

For now at least, you can fix it by manually editing the slug on your post
edit screen.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Caching of comments (trac 4387)
Message-ID: <200706011440.55845.hovenko@linpro.no>

I have posted a ticket on trac about a problem with comments caching.

There are three patches attached.

Ticket URL:
- http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4387


The last patch will also call on the action hook "wp_set_comment_status" after 
updating the comment with the function edit_comment, since that function 
might update the comment status as well.

The reason for this was because the wp-admin/moderation.php will call on the 
hook "wp_set_comment_status", but when editing comments from 
wp-admin/comment.php it will call on the hook "edit_comment". Where's the 
logic?

I don't find it too broken although it appeared to me to be so at first.
The developers have lots of things they'd like to do and lots of things
they need to do. What I see as important, isn't the same as what
everyone else sees as important.

I've submitted bug reports and fixes and it is very frustrating to see
bugs just sit unresolved, especially when you wrote a patch but bugs
appear to get resolved one way or another in the end.

Patience. :-)

Perhaps I'm being silly but that doesn't appear to work because
the_content prints output and doesn't return it where it could be used
as an input to $text.

The %stuff is the URL code for the upside down question mark. I suppose we
could just strip out all non-alphanumeric characters when creating the slug.

Yeah, the_content() echoes and doesn't return.

You would want apply_filters( 'the_content', get_the_content() ).

I've been a little disappointed. I hoped to use WP for a CMS I've been 
developing, but have been considering dumping the project to use another 
framework. I've been more than willing to patch and develop, but trac 
items seem to be glanced at and forgotten. That doesn't work when you're 
on a schedule and need to gauge the future of a project. Development 
direction seems very haphazard and whim-oriented. I'm not going to put 
time into something struggling for cohesion.

Are you talking about the same project? Specific tickets?

One thing is that the person that checks it in is on the hook to fix
it if it breaks something, so if you are around on #wp-hackers to
clean up after yourself your patches have a much better chance of
getting in.

Thank you,

Do we have an easy way to know which non-ASCII characters are
non-alphanumeric when we start talking about UTF characters from
non-English languages? How do we distinguish "word" characters from
punctuation when we start dealing with Russian, Chinese, Hebrew, etc? If
there isn't a reliable function for that already (I'm not sure, myself,
I'll leave a definitive answer up to someone with more i18n experience),
then the url-encoding mentioned here is still the best way to handle it,
I think.

Hi folks, Jennifer,

I'm kinda pullin hairs out here trying to do just this kind of thing.  
Can anyone point me to a plugin that does something like this? The  
documentation is so sparse and all over the place and I can't make it  
work ayeee

for now I'm just wanting to pull up template->test.php when I hit a  
category archive with /test appended
e.g.: /category/foobar/test -> use test.php template

been at this for 2 hours... must be overlooking something obvious or  
is it really voodoo? ;)

thnx!

B.

Maybe this one helps:
http://guff.szub.net/2005/07/21/post-templates-by-category/


Or take the usual template and try the conditional functions
in_category() and is_category() in an if-clause.

hrmm, thnx...

I think what I am missing is understanding how to find the query vars  
I specify in my updated rewrite rules, further along the line, for  
example in a is_test() function (which I call to then send WP the  
test.php template.

Again sorry if this is super basic.. I just can't seem to hook it up :(

two possible uses I am looking at:
/category/foobar/map -> full window map of posts pinned to places
/category/foobar/stats -> posting stats thingy

aaanyhoot, thnx again. :)

Ok, so assuming there is no "universal" way to do it, which are all the
filters that run before the post slug is created?

Maybe you could simply omit the WP loop for that special purpose in your
category.php (or index.php if you don't have a category.php):

if ( is_category('map') )
{
	map stuff;
}
elseif ( is_category('stats') ) 
{
	stats stuff;
}
else
{
	Da Loop;
}

Thanks again Alex. I'm affraid I am not making myself clear. sorry  
about that.

In my examples, map and stats are not categories but modifiers I  
attach... like
/category/foobar/feed

the reason I want to forward to another template is because, for the  
map for example I would incude all the stuff I need to display a map  
(and the whole layut wuld be different anyways), and for stats as well.

another example is I've been wanting to write a trackback plugin that  
allows for category trackbacks.
/category/foobar/trackback
in this case I'd forward to a wp-cat-trackback.php script

etc. :)

thnx again!

B.

Code something like this has worked for me to override template 
selection based on what I got into the query variables with rewrite rules:

add_action('template_redirect', 'myplugin_template_override' );

function myplugin_template_override()
   global $wp_query;

   $template = '';
   $q = $wp_query->query_vars;

   if( isset( $q[ 'mycustomvariable' ] )) {
     $template = TEMPLATEPATH . "/mycustomtemplate.php";
   }

   if( strlen( $template ) && file_exists( $template )) {
     include( $template );
     exit;
   }
}

Hope this helps,
      Jennifer

To be honest, I hear you. Unfortunately it's rather challenging to follow
all the changes, but if you wanted to you could CC it to me (I don't know
whether the other devs would mind) and it'll land in my email and I can take
a look at it.

I think the easiest way would be with
	if ( false !== strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], '/map') )
or
	if ( '/map' == substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], -4, 4) )

and use the template_redirect hook (as Jennifer proposed) in a plugin.

For UTF-8 strings, we first decompose accented  characters  in  Latin-1
Supplement  and  Latin Extended-A into their non accented forms.  If
mb_strtolower is available, that is run next.  Then all characters outside
the ASCII range are converted to encoded octets.  Then we strip any
remaining non-ASCII bits.  The call sequence is like this:

sanitize_title
sanitize_title_with_dashes
remove_accents
utf8_uri_encode

Non-UTF8 strings don't get the uri encoding.  If someone switched from
ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8, that would explain why "?" is being encoded instead of
stripped.

That is true, of course.

This will instead output (return) the content, just grabbed the code
from my CompleteRSS plugin:

<?php

function NST_get_the_content()
{
    global $post;
    // Password checking copied from get_the_content()
    if ( !empty( $post->post_password ) )
	if ( stripslashes( $_COOKIE['wp-postpass_'.COOKIEHASH] ) !=
$post->post_password )
	return get_the_password_form();
    return $post->post_content;
}

function NST_return_content()
{
    $content = NST_get_the_content();
    $content = apply_filters( 'the_content', $content );

    $content = str_replace(']]>', ']]&gt;', $content);
    return $content;
}

?>

I would love to see some of the functionality of SBM become a core patch 
for widgets. Some things that come to mind:

* Widgets are single-instance. It'd be great to have multiple copies of 
the same widget with different config options, for example imagine a 
links widget where you show different categories or arrangements in 
different places.
* That also solves the annoying text + rss widget number thing.
* Titles are annoying. My text widget is called "About Me", why does it 
say "Text Widget #9" on the screen.
* The interface doesn't work with a large number of available widgets, 
say 100.
* There is no save button on the widget config popups, so people don't 
know what to do. I'd like the screens to be a little bit more like Facebook.
* Saving a config option and the arrangement (layout) should be distinct.
* It'd be nice to have something to show certain widgets on certain page 
types, I think SBM totally has the right idea there.

Patches for any of the above would be gladly accepted and applauded.

Well we have Atom support now, I'm sorry it didn't come fast enough for
you, but it is what it is. It's unlikely anything like the 2.1 dev cycle
will happen again. The best way to have an impact on future development
is to participate positively in it, as it appears some of your
suggestions for the comments feed might have nuggets of.

However, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.

I don't think anyone involved has malicious intent for WordPress or any
standards, so there is no reason to belittle or insult ("the person who
implemented it had NEVER read the Atom 1.0 spec") people who made an
good-faith effort to make things better. I would rather someone try to 
contribute and make a mistake than sit on the sidelines. The bugs will 
be fixed --- it's not the end of the world.

The term "serialiser" is vague (what are you serialising from?), but I
assume you meant that the output should be built as, say, a DOM
object, then serialised from it to a text|application/xml document. If
so, then I disagree. It's not a magic bullet.

Most errors occur when users save posts and comments full of malformed
markup and bad character data. Building output as an XML DOM won't
help with that at all, because the broken input comes in as a string
and will need to be corrected beforehand. If that problem can be
solved, the class of errors that a serialiser would catch are
comparatively easy to handle.

WordPress works the way it does now because:

 a) It's an impossibly bad user-experience to show a yellow screen of
death to an end user.

 b) It's almost as bad to expect an end-user to manually correct
well-formedness errors. (Does Aunt Mildred even know what an entity
is?)

 c) It's hard to automatically, reliably correct broken HTML. The
rough consensus last time this came up was that it was *too* hard.

 d) If it's not too hard, well, the architecture is such that broken
HTML can be corrected in a plugin as easily as it can be in core. If
you build it, they will come.

Until that time, the fact is that the burden of dealing with bad
markup is pushed onto those users best able to deal with it. The
browsers already can; the major aggregators do (with varying degrees
of success); there are excellent error-correcting feed parsing
libraries for Python and Java.

Yes, as a feed consumer, it sucks, these might not seem like good
reasons, and it's perfectly fair to resent that the problem is pushed
onto you. (In my case, the path of least resistance was switching to
Python, where others had already dealt with it. ;)

In any event, it seems to me that many of the specific problems you
cite are symptomatic of the lack of automated testing. One check with
a validator would have caught the @content bug; unit tests would have
proven the tag balancing issue and prevented regressions. Tests with
an XML parser could catch the same errors as a serialiser. I'd much
rather see a comprehensive test suite than a bunch of hideous DOM
manipulation code.

But my TDD fanboyism is another issue for another day. I just thought
you deserved some more replies. :)

Any XML structure, whether it be SAX, DOM, or something else.

The serialiser will ensure that  that it is well-formed, so would  
therefore strip invalid characters.

Any UA that uses an XML parser already shows an XML fatal error.

Well, why not use HTML? That gets around both this and the above.

We already create broken HTML though. What's the difference?

IE7 refuses to display a feed with any XML error (including invalid  
characters).
Fx 2.0 and Safari 2 both display feeds with XML errors.

Like above, not all of the major aggregators do.

Each correcting errors in their own way, meaning you have to reverse- 
engineer one-another.

And suffer how browser makers have for years? "This feed works in x  
aggregator, but it doesn't work in your aggregator. Please fix this  
bug." ? So then you go off and do more reverse-engineering of  
malformed XML.

Using SAX would allow us to behave in similar ways as we already do.  
Tag-balancing issues would never arise with a serialiser. You're  
never going to have test suites to test everything. Something  
explicitly designed to avoid these errors would avoid them happening.  
There are literally thousands of places in WP where I can insert  
content that'll cause a fatal error.

Judging by your responses, we seem to be talking at cross purposes. I
assume you mean, use @type="html" instead of "xhtml", in which case,
yes -- there's no reason at all to be producing malformed Atom feeds.

In your original point 5, you complained that WordPress offers no
guarantee of producing well-formed, valid XHTML. I assumed you were
advocating such a guarantee.

To avoid further confusion, it would be helpful if you could outline
exactly what it is that you would like to happen. I am specifically
interested in points 1, 5 and 6. Jargon is better than imprecise
simplification.

To be fair, you'd have to do it anyway. :) WordPress isn't the only
fish in the sea.

The tag balancing problem arose in the context of a function to
correct constructions like `<p><blockquote></p></blockquote>`. I don't
see how a serialiser is relevant.

SAX is not relavent in the context of generating XML - SAX is all about
parsing xml in a simple way without having to build an in memory model
of the document to navigate like you do with a DOM parser.

The biggest problem with any XML output serialiser that want to ensure
the document is well formed before providing it is the fact that they
just don't scale well.  Especially not in a web context.

The memory usage of a DOM model of the page and the delay introduced
before sending any content just doesn't seem worth anything for the user
when you consider the fact that all it can do is stop you sending the
invalid XML it can't actually fix the problem.

The problem here is that if the output of your generator is invalid XML
then you need to fix the generator - wrapping it in a box and hiding the
fact that is doesn't work doesn't help anyone - the user still has to
fix what is being generated in order to get the output they want!

As I have said above SAX doesn't help. Serialisers only ensure valid
html in a purely technical sense.

Thanks for the help you two. I still haven't managed to get what I  
want to do to work (but I haven't been able to give it the full

If and when I get it working I'll post a full how-to here. :)

Message-ID: <B93A77A3-2A81-4EDA-A1BE-D135CBD76945@gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm writing a plugin for managing photo albums. Right now, the plugin  
creates a table for the photos, but I was wondering, what would  
happen if I stored the posts in the wp-posts table? I'd set the  
post_type to something like 'photo'. would it mess things up in  
future versions of WordPress?
The main benefit of doing this would be the ability to use the  
wordpress comments system for the photos.
Any input from people who understand the WordPress core would be  
really helpful.

I mean using HTML anywhere where we use XHTML.

I was advocating either ensuring that the output is valid (as any  
XHTML parser can throw a fatal error on invalid XHTML (and yes, I do  
mean invalid, not malformed)) or not using something where fatal  
errors can be thrown (such as HTML).

I don't really want to get into a long discussion about this, but I  
will say that with many major feed readers not doing any error  
handling, more minor ones can get away with it quite easily.

Parse it as HTML, then serialise it. You'll have well-formed and  
valid output. Trying to parse HTML using regular expressions will  
never work, simply due to the fact that there are de-facto UA (and  
yes, a parsing library is a UA) parsing rules that cannot be  
expressed as regular expressions. There are bugs with balanceTags()  
even under the limited subset of SGML that can be safely used in the  
real world (e.g., <img src="test.gif" alt="This is a test which is >  
*">).

Try telling that to the developers of gnu.xml.util.XMLWriter, a SAX  
based serialiser.

Then cache the output. The output doesn't change on every load.

Almost every serialiser I've come across _ALWAYS_ gives valid output  
even with broken input.

But a bug in a single library, as opposed to twenty places where  
strings are being put together, is less likely, as it receives twenty  
times the amount of testing.

As I have said above there are SAX serialisers. Surely if we have a  
focus on web standards making sure output is valid is a focus in itself?

If you really want to ensure WP's output is fine, regardless of the  
input, develop with XHTML sent as application/xhtml+xml AND use a  
DOCTYPE-aware XML parser. I guarantee it won't be hard to break.

Good you understand the difference. So many people don't.

For the record, it is a *lot* easier to ensure that output is 
well-formed than ensure that it is valid. For my own purposes, I am 
happy to stop at well-formedness. I don't mind validity if I get iut, 
but it's not essential.

If WordPress can guarantee well-formedness, that's worth doing on its 
own, even if it can't guarantee full validity.

A serialiser approaches irrelevancy if we have a sufficiently good
HTML parser. The single most important and problematic part of the
system is the part that handles unexpected input, which is to say,
errors. That part is presumably in the parser.

If we had such a parser, well-formedness would be a trivial problem.
That has *nothing* to do with a serialiser: if we can guarantee good
input, good output is easy.

But we have not had such a parser, and no-one has ever offered one. If
you have one, that's a game-changer. I would very much like the
technical details, or better yet the code.

I agree in theory, but there are practical considerations. If you have
a workable solution to the XHTML validity problem, hooray; I'll wait
for the details. (This comes right back to the HTML parser.) If not,
there are good reasons for maintaining the status quo.

You should be able to use your own post_type,  but I don't know of anyone
who has tried it yet.  If you start work on your plugin, I will help fix any
problems in core you come up against.  Your post_type should be more unique
than 'photo' so that we can avoid any future collisions with core or other
plugins.

Just an idea here, nothing too well formed, but would it be possible
to separate the rights for (un)marking a comment as spam and editing
the comment itself?

I'm thinking of giving contributers on WordPress permission to view
spam comments and despamify them or else send spam comments to the
spam queue, BUT not be able to edit or delete the contents of the
comments themselves.

Obviously it is very easy for humans to tell the difference between
ham and spam, while it gives even the best of algorithms a tough time
(even with Akismet, Bad Behavior, Spam Karma 2, and some other stuff
running). So I'm just thinking people could give this right to "spam
hunters" who could do this, but keeping full veto power with the
administrator and perserving the integrity of the comments by not
giving them permission to edit or delete comments they might find
offensive.

Just a thought......

Speaking of spam comments, I had to go medieval on a huge spam comment
queue (around 1200) a few weeks ago, and mass delete them from
database, since the comment management page could not load...

Oddly, I have the same problem now with a heavily tweaked WP as a CMS,
where the Pages management page encounter a timeout error when loading
the 200+ Pages list.

Any idea or workaround is welcome... (yes I'm thinking pagination too)

Ah cool, so instead of wasting resources on building anti-spam
datacentres like what they use for Akismet, we could go to Kamino and
get them to build us a clone army of human comment spam filters.

We could give them the capability only to log onto our WordPress
installations and spam or de-spam the comments without the worry of them
posting blog posts or editing comments. 100% accuracy.

Brilliant! :)

How do you propose you get from the parser output to XHTML, if not a  
serialiser?

The rules for HTML and XHTML differ (though if serving as text/html  
they follow neither specification), and you must therefore convert  
between the two (which is harder than it sounds).

There's an SGML parser in PEAR (which of course isn't overly relevant  
in the real world, as no browser uses an SGML parser, though would be  
better than what we currently have):
http://pear.php.net/package/XML_HTMLSax3

And there's several HTML5 parsers under development (HTML5 aims to be  
compatible with classic HTML parsers, and current web content):
http://php-html5lib.dashslot.net/
http://jero.net/lab/ph5p/

What about the second part of that comment, what about using HTML  
(which gets around the well-formed constraint of XHTML)?

Spot on, Jeremy!

I mean, humans are cheap. Hell, we could breed people to just do this
all day, give 'em food and board, and it'll be much cheaper than
paying bayesian developers and buying datacenters.. not to mention the
electricity costs too!!!

Gali: Download Spam Karma 2 and disable all modules but Akismet -
basically you'll have a paginated comment moderation page :-)

Actually, what I'm thinking of is some sort of Web 2.0 approach to all this.
www.killspam.com which has an infinite queue of messages that have

I'm surprised people still ask this question... The answer is
backwards compatibility, of course. IE7 still won't render
application/xhtml+xml. Until *the* major browser renders it, there's
no reason to serve it up as such.

Whoa... Are you seriously blaming Wordpress for the whole HTML to
XHTML transitional period?

Wordpress tries to follow standards, but I think that people want
their sites to actually work in modern browsers and on the modern web
as well. The idea is to keep current, not to be so cutting edge that
you slice your own toes off.

As for the inevitable "why XHTML" question, well, the answer there is
even simpler: There is no reason. It's up to the theme author. You can
make an HTML only theme for Wordpress without any real difficulty at
all, if you like. Themes control the content.

But why does the marketplace require XHTML at all? XHTML served as  
text/html brings absolutely no advantages over HTML, but gives one  
major disadvantage ? you become reliant on browser error handling for  
the XHTML to parse.

No, I'm criticising WP for using a transitional DOCTYPE and not a  
strict one.

Actually, you can't make an HTML theme. HTML disallows the solidus on  
empty tags. WP hard codes that behaviour in several places. It's  
impossible to output anything apart from XHTML.

I know you mean that HTML disallows the minimized syntax for empty elements
(since the regular form also uses a solidus in the closing tag), but "<br
/>" validates fine for HTML Transitional.

If you're not the type that requires that your document be perfectly valid
in order to sleep at night (I tend to think of validators as more of helper
tool than a gateway), the minimized form is also 100% reliable even if your
DOCTYPE is HTML Strict, AFAIK.

There are a thousand debates all over the internet regarding XHTML vs.
HTML. Go find your own reasoning.

As for me, I like something with a bit of structure to it. And as soon
as the major browser works with the correct MIME type, I intend to use
it. In the meantime, simple validation is good enough for me. Thus the
whole "Transitional" phase.

Also, every major browser renders valid XHTML much the same way (with
only minor differences). Switching to the right MIME type doesn't make
any difference in the browsers that do support it, other than speed of
rendering.

> No, I'm criticising WP for using a transitional DOCTYPE and not a
> strict one.

The most widely used browser in the world doesn't support XHTML *at
all*, and you're questioning the use of Transitional vs. Strict? I
think you need a healthy dose of perspective here... One step at a
time, yeah?

While you correctly pointed out that Wordpress does hardcode some
minimal form in some places, I will point out that you can very easily
switch any given theme to Strict or even to XHTML 1.1 if you like.
I've done it before, although I ended up switching back to
transitional for the time being. It's just simpler to deal with for
now.

Heck, most online systems that give out code to post in your blog
(Google Video, YouTube, etc) don't even give you valid *HTML* code...
I think Wordpress is doing pretty good and pushing forward on the
standards front.

There's nothing stopping you, but I would suggest using "attachment"
instead. That would be compatible with the existing uploads and

This is false and a common myth perpetrated repeatedly by a few myopic 
programmers who can't see beyond the browser. I can and do do many 
different things with XHTML served as text/html that I cannot do with 
classic HTML. In particular I can use the full XML toolchain to process 
such documents.

Browser display is not the only purpose of HTML and XHTML documents on 
the web. This is especially true for WordPress, where plugins need to do 
all sorts of weird things with the pages, inserting, deleting, 
rearranging, and filtering content. This is far easier and more reliable 
if the pages are well-formed

That's only true if you using XHTML Strict.  Since your blog uses XHTML
Transitional (which doesn't quite validate, BTW), it renders in "quirks" or
"almost standard" mode on various browsers.

If we just change the packaged themes, I'm sure new themes would start to
follow suit.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Windows Live Writer Plugin
Message-ID: <41aae4f0706041724u7bfd0008ua26ba84ffcf67263@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, I've been mucking with the idea of creating a manifest file for
Windows Live Writer, like what WordPress.com does by default & I've come up
with the beginnings of a  plugin, you can check it out here
http://www.divshare.com/download/838734-eb2 . It's using the API for
customising the blog panel with a manifest file (
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb463266.aspx ) and I've 'borrowed'
some of the image from the WordPress.com implementation, I hope this is ok.

It's very raw, but I was wanting opinions, mostly on whether this is a good
idea or not?  Since this has been added into WordPress.com by default, it
this something that will likely be added to the WordPress core any time
soon?

Any feedback is welcome!

That sounds like a great idea - I was thinking along the same lines
too. I'd love to get a tagging plugin integrated into WLW for the 2.3
version of Wordpress.

I haven't yet looked at the api properly yet, but will do so soon.

I was addressing your insistence that an XML serialiser would solve
all of our validity woes. The hard part is generating a good input
stream for it; once that's done, it's far from impossible to serialise
valid output through string concatenation and other nasties. (I'm not
saying it's better, just that it's possible.) That part is
comparatively easy.

The declared content-type is irrelevant. Most of the markup we'd be
likely to encounter is more or less common to both -- quoted
attributes, no missing end tags, no xmlns, whatever.

Again, the issue is the part of the system that can recognize, say, a
missing end tag, and generate a parsing event for it. (Especially
given that some of the input is guaranteed to be illegal HTML too.)

The HTML5 parsers were never an option before (they didn't exist), but
they're definitely worth looking into.

Sorry if I've misread you but is this much different to?

<title><?php wp_title(' '); ?> <?php if(wp_title(' ', false)) { echo '

I thought it depended on format of the doctype, not the version?

That is incorrect.  If a document has a proper doctype at the top, it  
will display in Standards mode (In IE, Firefox, Safari).  Quirks mode  
kicks in when there is no doctype, or (I believe) an incorrect or  
unrecognized doctype.

(Also, the doctype must be the very first thing on the page --  
NOTHING comes before it.)

Now, validation errors can do screwy things, so those can certainly  
muddle the issue.

It's not the intended behavior, the "content type" should not have any
effect on the presentation side, but in the real world a Transitional
doctype will force the browser into quirks mode.

I think we'll be able to do separate widget options with some changes
to the core. Given that, I'm not sure if wp_postmeta (which is storing
quite a bit already) is the best place for it moving forward, or if a
new table for widget options (eg: wp_page_widgets) would be the most
future-proof implementation.

HTML 4.01 Transitional renders in quirks. XHTML 1.0 Transitional  
renders in either standards or almost standards.

No, the solidus represents a null end tag[1]. It validates as a NET,  
not as a self-closing tag

It makes quite a few differences to DOM, as well as a few more minor  
things in CSS.

Yes, I only implement (X)HTML in several ways completely unrelated to  
browsers. I obviously can't see beyond the browser.

But WP can create malformed XML. The feeds are just an example of  
that. That argument is only valid when you know the output is well- 
formed.

True, serving as application/xhtml+xml breaks a whole lot of
javascript code. Things like document.write stop working, for one
thing.

So, basically, serving with the application/xhtml+xml MIME type will
break a whole heck of a lot of pages and themes. Where's the
incentive, again?

Nope.  XHTML Transitional, with a proper DOCTYPE and with or without an XML
declaration, renders in "quirks" or "almost standard" mode in Safari and
IE7.

A solidus is just a forward slash.  Both closing tags for empty elements
("</blah>") and empty elements with a minimized syntax ("<blah />") use a
solidus.

Since HTML constructs like "<p></p>" are perfectly valid, HTML obviously
allows the solidus on empty tags.  You really meant "HTML doesn't allow
empty elements with a minimized syntax", but that's not correct as I noted
below.

You can continue to disagree, but I've said everything I needed to about
this tiny-yet-almost-completely-insignificant issue.

No, the solidus represents a null end tag[1]. It validates as a NET,  
not as a self-closing tag

Can you please cite something? The validator marks this as valid as  
it is a null end tag (so <p/> is equivalent to <p>/</p>). The SGML  
declaration of HTML[1] and SGML[2] make this plainly clear. The SGML  
declaration would need NESTC "/" and NET ">" to allow the behaviour  
you are describing.

Which in turn breaks jQuery when you try to write elements dynamically
like this:

	$("<p>Hello, world!</p>").after("p#some-element");

OK, yet another question, even though this thread is now dead. :P

The current specification of the Atom Publishing Protocol/Atom API  
would be... where? Has it seriously been dead since December of 2003?  
And as for PHP implementations, how much would would you say this  
(http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/atom/PhpAtomApiImplementation) covers?

I know this really isn't the place for Atom API discussion, but,  
really... what is? ;)

Thanks!

The 15th (hopefully final!) draft of the specification was published a
week or two ago and is currently being evaluated by the Internet
Engineering Steering Group:

 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi?command=view_id&dTag=11965&rfc_flag=0>

Hello WordPressland!

I'm new to WordPress and building a custom template for my new  
personal site. My design calls for a calendar that stays within a  
given category, and I couldn't find a way to do that; using  
"get_calendar()" on my category archive page returned a calendar with  
all posts in it, therefore providing navigation to pages outside the  
selected category (which didn't work out).

I have patches to the get_category, get_month_link, and get_day_link  
functions that let you have in-category calendars (see attached diffs  
for wp-includes/general-template.php and wp-includes/link- 
template.php). You can use the modified calendar on the archive page  
like so:

$cat = array_shift( get_the_category() );
get_calendar( true, $cat->cat_ID );

I'm not sure if that's the canonical way to find the archive page's  
category id (I kinda doubt it), but it works.

I don't have any other contributors to my site planned, but it  
wouldn't be hard to make the calendar glue itself to the author in  
the same way...but is there a standard WordPressian way to accomplish  
this without modifications like these?

??

Thanks for any feedback and thanks for WordPress!

I think $wp_the_query->get_queried_object_id() is what you're looking for.

Wrong, what about:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Make a Ticket on Trac for this... So we can actually see the diffs, and
it'll probably get more attention on there.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Editor colSpan bug?
Message-ID: <46666AFB.5060901@ntlworld.com>

Hi,
Entering a table in the Tinymce editor, (using the code tab) changes <th 
colspan="2> to <th colSpan="2"> when post is saved.

I have tried to find the cause, and found that this occurs using 
Wordpress v2.1 or 2.2, with the Visual Editor selected to Yes in 
profile, and unfiltered html capability = on.
If visual editor setting is off (so only code page shows) this does not 
occur, and the post is saved correctly. I have not managed to find where 
this occurs.

This appears to be a bug - I have tried searching wordpress trac and the 
Moxiecode buglist, dont't see anything that describes this.. would one 
of you more experienced guys be able to confirm this is a known (or 
unknown!) bug?
Best Regards
Chris

Yes, WP can create malformed XML.

No, WP should not create malformed XML.

It is possible to autofix all malformedness before publishing anything. 
This has been proven by example in Java (Google TagSoup). I am not yet 
aware of a similar effort in PHP. Tidy comes close but is not quite 
robust enough.

It may be possible to fix the WordPress problem effectively without 
fixing all malformed HTML. If the themes start well-formed, then all we 
really need to worry about are the posts and comments, and those use 
only a subset of HTML to begin with.

I'm confused.  It looks as though you're trying to use invalid markup
and tMCE is correcting it for you. What's the problem?

Hi Doug,
the other way round!
I enter colspan="2", which IS valid markup.

When post is saved, it gets changed to colSpan="2", with capital S, 
which is NOT valid markup.

In TRAC, somehow, in the comments you have hyperlinks to the ticket #'s.  Is that individually hard coded, or do you have a
Subversion property set?  I've tried to work with the bugtrac properties, but I haven't gotten the links to show up in the
TRAC comments yet.

Ahhh, I see.  You said:
====
<th colspan="2> to <th colSpan="2">
====

I was keying on the missing double quote after the first 2.

#[ticket number] is interpreted as a link to the ticket in Trac, just
like r[revision number] is interpreted as a link to the changeset.
Austin's link has all the formatting laid out quite nicely.

Harumph harumph!!!

That's it.  I'm taking my ball and going home!

I've been running two sites with the two different doctypes for years  
now, and never noticed that the transitional one was in quirks....   
Must be my incredibly tight and flawless code.

No... that can't be it.  ;)

As a test I tried changing a fairly complex transitional page to  
strict, and the only change in appearance was that an unordered list  
shifted down just a bit. Huh.

You got me on the xml header, but does anyone commonly use those in  
web pages?  I recall some version of IE (probably 5.5) rendering  
pages with that header as raw XML structure, so I figured nobody  
actually used it for XHTML.

Hello,
I'm trying to create/modify a plugin that emails a copy of my post when its published. This is not a problem unless I am using a future_post. Does anyone know how to make this work? Its been suggested to me that I need to use the publish_future_post hook. (http://wordpress.org/support/topic/113570?replies=13) 

The problem is, I can't get this to work. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,

<p></p> is valid. I never said otherwise. I said <p/> is invalid as  
an empty tag. That point still stands (the validator marks it as  
valid under such a test document, as it is a valid NET tag, which has  
a completely different meaning).

HTML is. I've explicitly cited the spec yet you refuse to accept what  
the spec says? What's unclear about "HTML 4 is an SGML application  
conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized  
Markup Language [ISO8879]."?

Also, if that's true, why does the validator use an SGML parser for  
HTML? View the source of it, and you'll see it does.

Lastly, as HTML is treated in the real world (which isn't SGML) <p/>  
is an opening tag (the solidus creates a parse error as an invalid  
attribute), which is not closed till the next </p> (or implied </p>).

Message-ID: <3923bda50706060912o5aa09e24q32de638e6bf74fbd@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

Just thought I'd drop a mention here on wp-hackers regarding the Sandbox
Designs Competition, help get the word out.

Basically this is a CSS design competition much like the one held by Alex
King in February of 2004,   http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles/,
except this once uses the Sandbox theme instead of 'Classic.

Anyhow, I've hopefully provided a comp that gives the participants and
judges plenty of highlighting, re:

http://www.sndbx.org/results/designs/
http://www.sndbx.org/results/participants/
http://www.sndbx.org/judging/about-the-judges/

Currently the first place winner receives US$500 (not bad for a CSS and
image-only design). We have a total pool of US$1000. I figured that I've had
people donating after downloading my themes and all that kind of stuff. Matt
chipped in too. So if you know anyone else who'd be interested in
sponsoring, that'd be great.

Also, this'd be a really good place to mention that we're looking for judges
as well. If you're interested, just let me know. You get a neat-o bio bit on
the comp page (see link above).

So what really makes this comp kind of exciting and different is that it'll
be benefiting both the wp.org and wp.com folks. That's one of the big
benefits of doing a CSS designs comp instead of another themes comp (not to
mention the last two theme competitions failed, for varying reasons, so
maybe it was time to try something different).

And so on and so forth.

Here are just a few details:

No, you said, "HTML disallows the solidus on empty tags."  You see the
solidus there, right?   :^P

SGML is a system for defining markup languages.  HTML is a markup language
that uses some SGML constructs.  While HTML bears a close resemblance to an
SGML application, it is a separate language with its own parsing rules.  If
HTML parsers treated HTML as an SGML application, the web would break.  Note
that HTML 5 proposals stop even pretending that HTML is an SGML application.
Enough said, I think.

Neither SGML or XML call <p></p> an empty tag Learn the difference  
between a tag and an element. <p></p> is a start tag followed by a  
close tag. It is not a tag.

According to HTML 4.01, it is an SGML application. HTML 4.01, though  
irrelevant in the real world, is the current HTML recommendation.

"proposals"? Which others (apart from the WHATWG/W3C HTML WG one) are  
you referring to? HTML5 still disallows non-empty elements to close  
themselves (like <p/>). It allows empty elements to have a solidus  
present, though that was only after many complained for the sole  
reason of its appearance.

Hello,

I recently submitted a patch for the problem addressed by ticket
#3807. The solution, was however, not good enough regarding the
required level of security.
In order to solve this problem correctly, I submitted a new patch a
few minutes ago. I think it is secure, but I might have overlooked
something. So any feedback is welcome. :)

That will make it a an XML document not and HTML one, and you will
need to send this as application/xml which will leave every IE6 user
aside... so yes, the doctype (strict if you want it to work properly)
will be the first thing the browser should see on the (html) document.

Hope this isn't considered off topic.

I registered the domain wp-content.org back in February but I've
realised I'm never going to use it, so it's free to whoever wants it.
Expires Feb 2008. Reply within the list please.

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#strict

Right near that, you'll see:

"An XML declaration is not required in all XML documents; however XHTML
document authors are strongly encouraged to use XML declarations in all
their documents. Such a declaration is required when the character encoding
of the document is other than the default UTF-8 or UTF-16 and no encoding
was determined by a higher-level protocol."

Strongly Encouraged, is the key words in there. :P

However, in the Real World, IE6 triggers quirks mode if it finds an XML
declaration at the top of a document. They removed this "feature" in
IE7, but IE6 is still dominant, and we can't ignore that.

Would have loved to have seen this a few weeks ago.  We just did a
multiple WPMu site wide tagging system of our own with mutags.net

Oh well. :)

It is an interesting scenario of when one channel is better than
another: one person's support request really is another's bug report.
It all comes down to how likely the problem is WordPress and if there
is as much detail as possible to investigate it.

Baring a high frequency of reports for the problem described there, I
agree it would be best to nicely redirect the person to
http://wordpress.org/support

Thanks Mike,
Lloyd

PS. not sure about that staff bit ;-)

Two things:

1- In order for this to work you must already have a valid username  
and password
2- It has already been fixed.

Hi gang,

Mysterious thing started happening yesterday afternoon on our site,  
globalvoicesonline.org: a post appeared twice in some but not all of  
the category archives of categories it was assignd to.

pokign my head into the database revealed that 9 of the 11 categories  
the post was associated to, were associated twice!

e.g.:
post2cat:
rel_id	post_id	category_id
145262  	26542  	300
145256 	26542 	300

(yeah we're at almost 30,000 posts, 350 categories and almost 150k  
post2cat associations... ouch)

I'm thinking there's something funky happening at posting time? Or on  
auto-save?

[May this be related to some strange behavior some of our authors

Is there somewhere else I need to mention this? Bug tracker? :D

Would you like a query to clean that up or have you got that  licked
already?  Assuming you are on MySQL 4.1+ I can give you a 1 liner that
will remove the extras.

BTW I would definitely say log it in Trac so that it at least is
recorded and it can be repaired later.

Message-ID: <84ce626f0706081121n49bc02bem81c7caf84cb2238@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

When a new post is created, the "wp_insert_post" hook is fired off,
and all functions that registered (via add_action() ) to that hook
will get activated.

Now... correct me if I'm wrong, but... as I understand the system...
when a new post is being created, it is given a temporary negative
"post_id".  (Like "-8388432")

When the post is actually created, this gets changed to a real
positive "post_id".  (Like "5".)

In the "wp_insert_post" hook, I know how to get the real positive "post_id"....

BUT... how do you get the temporary negative "post_id" from which it came?


See ya

Thanks Brian, I rectified it in the DB but by all means if you have  
that 1 liner in case I need it... ;)

little extra info on this occurence came in after I sent this off:  
the editor and the author apparently at some point were working on  
the post in question at the same time. Details of draft mode/ 
publication time are unavailable though (one's in NYC the other in  
jees not even sure The Hague or somesuch?)

:)

Hello,

(I'm answering my own question, but....)

I was digging though the code, and it looks like you can get that this
info from...

    $_POST['temp_ID']

Someone should throw that in the documentation for the
"wp_insert_post" hook.  (Other would probably find it helpful too.)

Hello,

Not really sure where to report this... but I think I found a CSS bug.

The <button> element does NOT get the same style as the <input

I.e., the buttons made with <button> dod NOT look the same as the
buttons made with <input type="submit">

This is probably because the <input type="submit"> do not have
class="button".

In my opinion, wp-admin's CSS should include something like the following:

As you can see from line 337 of wp-admin.css (in 2.2), if you give
your <button> a class of 'button' and you put your <input
type="submit"> inside a paragraph with class 'submit' then they'll be
styled the same. Every submit button in the admin interface is inside
a paragraph with class 'submit', so it would be good practice to
follow this in your plugin.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Canvas. Did anyone heard about this?
Message-ID: <466A93FA.70806@gmail.com>

Hi,

I just stumbled upon this plugin called Canvas[1] and it seems like an 
interesting thing to include with wp. I haven't had the chance to really 
dive into it, but perhaps somebody on this list already did?

The original authors are looking for some new maintainers[2] and it 
would be a shame to let this plugin disappear as it seems to make a nice 
addition to the sidebar widgets. Any thoughts on this?

How are we doing on the re-structuring of the admin section.  One example would be the re-naming of "Blogroll" to something
more 'enivronment-agnostic' (such as a CMS) which we talked about earlier.  Is there a general ticket on this?

This is not directed at you personally, but at the community as a
suggestion/reminder as this is the second time in two minutes that I have
opened a message to a technical list and found a message like this.  Please,
in the interest of making the most of your own time, if you are going to
post a message to drive traffic to a URL, please say more then "This is
cool" or a rough paraphrase of same.  Tell us what the heck it is you are
promoting.  The first link you provided doesn't even tell us what Canvas is
supposed to be.  Just because you are excited about it doesn't mean the rest
of us will click through multiple links to try to puzzle out what you are
promoting based solely on your enthusiasm.

Good morning freedom lovers,

Just a quick message to let you know that over the past few days GNOME has
migrated from NewsBruiser (which basically stopped being maintained around
the time we implemented it) to WordPress ? and the response from our users
has been overwhelmingly positive. :-) In many ways, WP and GNOME have very
similar philosophical views on freedom, usability and tastefulness, so I'm
happy we're in good hands! :-)

Thanks very much to all the WordPress and WPMU hackers! I hope some of the
fixes and changes I'm working on can be a fitting return contribution. :-)

I'm sure most WP developers would be as entertained to be on the receiving

Hi Jeff,

This is awesome! I am a passionate GNOME user and a big fan of yours!

I went to blog about it, and found no link to love at
http://perkypants.org/blog/ ;-)

Looking forward to both projects benefiting from this relationship,

It's powerful, but quite a mess for end users, or at least for *our*  
end users.  Concepts are really good, but just a little old.
Looks like it's concept is born before widgets concept, and never  
sync with WP trunk ideas anymore.

We spent two weeks prototyping on it, but we dropped because of too  
many issues. Figure that we have even made some widgets! :-)

It's a shame, but is also a huge work. Hope that some code and some  
ideas will be taken to start new projects, sometimes is better than  
reiterating.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Security Releases Proposal
Message-ID: <70ebb7140706111140j1f8f72a9hef7e475b7aeb4fa6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have read a lot of feedback about WordPress 2.2, and it is largely
very positive!

I think for the future it is important to maintain (severe) security
releases for the previous version until at least after feedback is
received on the first maintenance releast of the new version.

For example, step in my time machine:
2.1.4 would have been released if new severe security issues, instead
of focusing that we were really close to releasing 2.2 and that it
addressed the issue.
2.2 released
2.1.n released if any new severe security issue
2.2.1 released
2.1.n released if any new severe security issue, waiting on feedback
regarding 2.2.1 then retire 2.1 branch.

This may feel like quite a bit of additional work, but it should be
manageable by only addressing severe security issues. On our short
development cycle this also gives theme and plugin authors time to
update.

I think this will better match what WordPressers want.

What do you think?

Thank you,

I absolutely agree! Security fixes must be installed quickly, and admins
must be sure that there are (almost) no functional changes beyond what
the fix does. Feature upgrades may need the right time for deployment,
and if a security fix comes only with a major feature upgrade, people
tend to resign from upgrading. So I also think that it is crucial to
distinguish between security releases and feature upgrades.

Best,
Alex

Subject: [wp-hackers] Reusable code should be easier to use in other projects
Message-ID: <de9859ac0706111146j29678e90j78c741f6793e17d9@mail.gmail.com>

Wordpress is a great project with a lot of great code. A lot of the
code is directed towards the actual blog software, but there is a lot
of code snippets which could be utilized in many other projects. For
instance autoop(), auto_clickable() and antispambot(). However, it is
not easy to include these in other projects without having to track
down the Wordpress code and finding them.

I would suggest to put these reusable components in a PEAR channel
(not to be confused with making them a part of the PEAR project).
Having the functions in a PEAR channel would make it easy to use them
by other projects.

An example is this:

http://public.intraface.dk/index.php?package=antispambot

Now it would be possible for anybody to install antispambot on their
own server (in their include directory) with the following command
from the command line:

$ pear install intrafacepublic/antispambot

And if there comes a new version of antispambot, just the following:

$ pear upgrade intrafacepublic/antispambot

The method is from the commandline, but it can also be achieved
through a webfrontend. So say Wordpress incorporated a webfronted
where you could update or install individual parts of the Wordpress
system. You could just have a button with the text "update all" or
just some checkboxes with individual components - and there would be
no hazzle of having to play with either ftp or the command line.

Actually, the whole wordpress community - I think - would benefit if
incorporating the PEAR installer much more in the project. I would
make installation and updating everything much easier when a new
version of the core code or just a single plugin in rolled out.

Extracting functions etc. for generic use is certainly a good idea -- if
somebody is willing to do the job. However, PEAR is not an option here,
mostly because of license issues. WordPress is GPL, and PEAR doesn't
allow GPLed code.

I don't think licenses issues would arrive with the use of PEAR 
channels. As I understood it is only meant for PEAR the repository not 
for unofficial channels with their own repositories, which Lars seems to 
suggest.

Yeah, there should be no license issues with this approach.

My apologies then. I always thought that anything that goes over PEAR
must be under one of the designated licenses.

I am not quite convinced that this is the right way to go about it.

At present we have a security only supported version (v2.0.x) and if
security above features is your bag then this is what you should run.

However, we should always release a security update to the current
version if an issue exists even if the next feature release is to be
within the next couple of days.

To summaries:

On Day x current version is 2.2.7 and exploit y is published then we
should asap release 2.2.8 with a fix.

However if the current version is 2.3 then the security fix should go
into 2.3.1 - and probably any other non-security fixes that have already
been made but have not had sufficient testing should be kept until 2.3.2

In general in order for an efficient development process you need to
ensure that you are supporting the minimum number of code sets.

What we really need is a clear concise security response policy, that
defines the process under which issues are handled from notification
through to release (preferably with a quick but achievable timeline).

We should always be able to respond to security issue(s) with a new
point release of the currently supported version which just fix the
issue(s) - this makes it very safe for people to upgrade.

I think it might be even better, for security issues related to just a few
files/lines of code, to also release along site the new version fxing it, is
to release a text file that has what code to find, and what to replace it
with, so more advanced users can upgrade even faster.

Yes and No.

Releasing diff files to allow people to use patch is a good idea.

Encouraging people to hack files in there favourite text editor is a bad
idea - there are too many things which can go wrong e.g.

1. Missing bits of the change.
2. Editor converts the line endings or otherwise screws with the file.

etc.

There is a third way, less complicated for most users than diff file
and that avoid to have users hacj file manually... a "patch" distro
with only the interested files that correct security flawn.

If we are near a release of 2.3 (some days ahead) or just released it (some 
days ago) when exploit "y" is found, we should also patch up the 2.2 release, 
not only fix the bug in 2.3 or 2.3.1.

Problem with that would be if someone tries to patch x.y.1 with a file meant
for patch x.y.2.

This would apply to a list of code to patch by hand as you proposed,
people can apply this to an erroneous version with the addition of the
risk to mistype something even if working on the right version to
patch.

I know.

You would just be copying and pasting the code...

I agree.  2.1.3 users were put in a difficult position when 2.2  
became their only option.  They had to choose between security and  
stability.  Once there is a viable (stable) upgrade path available,  
we can discontinue security updates for a previous branch, but not  
before.

Just to make sure: we're only providing security updates for 2.0.x,
the current release, and trunk; right? Anything else in between (like
now 2.1.x) is not supported?

When I was starting my new blog, I liked a lot of the aspects of the
wordpress.com site, and created an account there.  I like the "online
community" sort of thing, as well as the tracking of new and popular
blogs, etc.  However, I was ultimately deterred because I wouldn't be
able to install other plugins of my choosing.  Now I have my blog
hosted elsewhere, but would like if people could still access the
content through the wordpress.com site.  Is there a crossposting
method available for this?  If not, I know there are "import via RSS"
plugins that allow a blog to grab all new posts from another - would
it be possible for something like this to be enabled on that site?
(Perhaps it has been since I last asked even.)

2.1.x is not currently supported.  What I think Lloyd is advocating  
is that (from here on out) we not abandon the penultimate branch  
until the latest branch has at least one good stability update under  
its belt.  So, going back in time, we'd have patched 2.1.x for the  
security bugs, because as of yet, 2.2 doesn't have its first x.x.y  
release under its belt and presents somewhat of a conundrum to 2.1.3  
users.

You could use XML-RPC as an API to do this.  Instead of "pulling"  
posts into WP.com, you'd be "pushing" them.

You might want to review WP.com's TOS before doing this, however...  
IANAL and I am not at all involved with WP.com, but they do have this  
prohibition in their TOS [1]:

"the Content is not spam, and does not contain unethical or unwanted  
commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or  
boost the search engine rankings of third party sites"

If the WP.com blog exists only to push traffic to your main blog, you  
might be in violation of that.  Again, IANAL, and am not associated  
with WP.com :-)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin options page
Message-ID: <1181723711.5401.20.camel@localhost>

Hi,

I have an idea I'd like to discuss.

There are many plugins that need to add options to the admin panel. For
many plugins, this is only some few options. It is unneccessary to
create a separate subpage for that, an additional fieldset on an
existing page would already be sufficient.

I wonder if WordPress could introduce an additional Options page, where
plugins with few options can just hook in, add their one or two options
in a fieldset and have their separate "Save" button (and maybe a global
"Save" for the page). I know that there is ./wp-admin/options.php, but
this is not very userfriendly.

Alternatively, the existing Options pages could get new hooks, so the
plugins could simply add their options there.

Best regards,
Alex

One of the benefits of having a blog at wordpress.com is that you are
joining a community.
If you choose to leave for your own domain / blog elsewhere then you lose
those community features.

If we allowed cross-posting into the blogs and therefore into our Tags
pages, the effect would be to encourage spammers and others in their efforts
to gain traffic. So the part of the ToS that Mark quotes will be used.
Additionally, the content of the blog on wordpress.com would be a duplicate
of another blog elsewhere which is another point against it.

You can't leave wordpress.com but select those elements you want to stay
hooked into - whether using plugins or not. So there may well be a method
but it is not something that would be permitted.

The following actions might help you:

http://wphooks.flatearth.org/hooks/dbx_page_advanced/
http://wphooks.flatearth.org/hooks/dbx_page_sidebar/
http://wphooks.flatearth.org/hooks/dbx_post_advanced/
http://wphooks.flatearth.org/hooks/dbx_post_sidebar/

They aren't documented yet on wphooks but they allow you to add extra
docking boxes to the edit post and edit page pages.

I'd have to agree.  A vital security patch within a month of a major release
is unique situation.  If the fix doesn't require a large rework, it seems
best to do release an updated for the penultimate version.  I don't know
that I would tie it to a point release.  That's even more arbitrary than
just picking 1 month as the time frame.  A point release could be two days
after the major release or two months.  1 mo. is a reasonable time frame to
allow preparation for an update in most situations.  Plus penultimate is my
favorite word and I rarely get to use it in sentences. Kudos for Mark
working conundrum into the same paragraph!

You might want to take a look at this:

  http://rhymedcode.net/projects/custom-field-gui/

Check out the info on Custom Field GUI and also for Custom Write Panel.
Those appear to do the kind of thing you're wanting (make a
pre-configured interface for custom fields, instead of the generic
free-form interface).

You are going to need to use the save_post hook to read the data from 
the form sections your dbx_post_advanced hook added. Be careful 
though, because save_post runs at other times as well, so you will 
need to use "nonces" to verify the save came from your edit screen 
section.

I'd suggest reading the code for existing plugins that add custom 
sections to the post edit screen -- geographical plugins are a good 
example. If they're GPL'd and your plugin is too, you can borrow their 
code. :)

Here's my 2 cents:

a) I personally don't think it is much less work to have your plugin 
create its own options page, vs. adding to an existing options page.

b) I think it is easier for the plugin user to find the plugin options 
if they are on a separate page dedicated to that plugin and named with 
the plugin name, rather than trying to guess which regular options 
page the plugin author might have chosen to put them on. A separate 
generic "Plugin Options" page would be OK, but since most existing 
plugins already have their own options pages, it might be empty most 
of the time. Alternatively, if lots of plugins started using the 
generic "Plugin Options" page, it could become really long and unwieldy.

c) Having two separate Save/Submit buttons on the same page seems like 
it would be confusing.

maybe a  framework for writing options pages would be nice, as their 
structure is predictable enough. I wrote some "template tags" for this a 
while ago and my life is a lot easier; picture how 
this(http://dev.wp-plugins.org/browser/inline-gallery/trunk/options.php?format=txt) 
would look written in spaghetti php...

my "template tags" are actually a way of moving ugliness out of sight, 
though; the spaghetti is still there, hidden in options-lib.php. perhaps 
it would be even better to do something like "register_options(plugin 
name, array(type, validation pattern, etc...))" and only call 
"render_options(plugin name)" to get the options page

> b) I think it is easier for the plugin user to find the plugin options

true; however this can be addressed in the plug-in list page (add a link 
to the relevant options page)

I have about 20 plug-ins activated (and I tried really hard to get that 
number low); 3 of them have their own options page, about half of them 
required some editing and setting 1 or 2 variables.

> Alternatively, if lots of plugins started using the generic "Plugin 
> Options" page, it could become really long and unwieldy.

true, but this is easily fixable with javascript/ajax magic; and a long 
page you are loading only when you need to change some options to a 
plug-in is definitely better than a kilometre long option pages list 
that wraps

> c) Having two separate Save/Submit buttons on the same page seems like 
> it would be confusing.

can be solved by hiding all other plug-in options but the one currently 
being configured (accordion control): the user would only see one submit 
button at a time; alternatively, the plug-ins only add variables that 
need to be edited to an array, and there would be only one submit button.

Sabin already covered a lot of things, but here's my 2 cents....

Trying to decide if I prefer the idea of adding options to the main  
options page or making a separate page.  Maybe a clearly identified  
"Third party" options section on the main page would be best?  (with  
accordion close so it doesn't get unwieldy)

It's always nice to have options (no pun intended).  Plus, this is as  
much a question of making things nice for the end user as for the  
programmers.

A good point.  As Sabin mentioned, an options link from the plugin  
page might be best.

Actually, from a user-interface standpoint, that might be the best  
way to go... what about an options page (or mini-popup) that is  
_only_ linked from the plugins page?  This would be a _very_ good  
idea for plugins with simple set-and-forget options that you only  
have to change when first activating a plugin.

So hide it if it's empty.  It only appears if there's a plugin that  
uses it.

> c) Having two separate Save/Submit buttons on the same page seems  
> like it would be confusing.

Agreed.  I like Sabin's idea -- the options page only shows the  
header for each plugin.  When you click on it, that plugin's options  
section opens up, and has a submit button.  You can only have one  
section open at a time.

Each section should have a "name" link tag so that you can link to a  
particular plugin's section with options.php#pluginname.  A  
JavaScript perhaps can auto-open the section if it's accessed through  
such a link.


Related to all of this, there are a number of plugin authors  
(including myself) who put a link to the plugin's Options page within  
the description on the Plugins page.  Maybe we should standardize  
such a link to encourage those links.  They're _extremely_ handy when  
activating plugins so that you don't have to hunt around for the new  
Options screen.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Ping and Privacy - misleading choices in Blog
	Visibility
Message-ID: <a6128e200706130956o609e2debg2159d86c249ce710@mail.gmail.com>

I have searched the archives, but I have not found any discussion here
about the privacy options for "blog visibility" in WP. I am curious if
anyone has heard concern about the wording of these options as being
misleading to a new blogger, or someone using WP as a CMS?

I have seen many posts on the Support forum from new users about how
to stop Yahoo, Google, etc from crawling one's blog, and even a thread
from experienced users about the privacy issues of ping-o-matic being
a default setting
(http://wordpress.org/support/topic/88417?replies=13), so I'm
surprised it is still being set by default in newer versions.

There is now an option during installation to set the privacy options,
but I think this is really misleading to a newbie. Even with my two
years of experience hacking WP, and probably 30+ installs, when I
first saw this option I was unsure if it was related to pinging, or if
it was something new that might create/modify a robots.txt file. It
sounded more like the latter.

>> I would like my blog to be visible to everyone, including search
engines (like Google, Sphere, Technorati) and archivers

>> I would like to block search engines, but allow normal visitors

The wording of these options addresses search engines -- blocking or
allowing them -- and says nothing about pings or Ping-O-Matic. The
term "archivers" is only well-known in blogging circles, and doesn't
stand out as anything special to a new blogger, or someone installing
WP to be used as a CMS.

I also find it confusing (from the perspective of a new user) that
this Blog Visibility is a whole new section of admin, separate from
the Options --> Reading (V) Update Services choices. And there is no
reference to Update services in this section at all. There is a
reference back here if you disable it -- in Update Services, you are
informed that no pinging is happening because of your Privacy
Settings.

What about the person who does want their site crawled by search
engines ultimately, but assumes quite naturally that won't happen
until he gets some content and activity? This comes across at the
point of installation as a simple yes or no question, when really
there is much more to it that the user does not understand.

If someone new to WP doesn't get around to checking out all the
options, and just starts happily blogging (as he is encouraged to do
by the WP installation interface :)) he would probably not realize
that he is pinging Ping-O-Matic every time he hits "Publish".

It seems to me that new users should be informed of exactly what this
all means if they are being given the option during set up,
considering that their very first post (or even a test modification to
the Hello World post) gets immediately published to ping-o-matic
without their permission or knowledge. I would also think that with
all the security issues under discussion, having Ping-O-Matic DISabled
by default would be a much better choice. This seems like a serious
security issue to me, but most average users (the ones who clicked a
one-step installation button in Fantastico and started blogging.....)
probably don't even know it's there.

I would very much like to hear the thoughts and opinions of others on
this topic.

Scenario: You have several plugins activated and this new plugin
options page now lists options for a several plugins. There's this
fantastically confusing accordion thing on there. You open up one
section and change an option, then open up a different section, make
some changes, and hit "Save"... what gets saved? All the changes
you've made to each plugin? Or just the currently open section? How is
the user to know? Hmm... maybe the options get automatically saved
when you open a new section? Who knows?

How is this page going to look and function when Javascript is disabled?

I think such an options page could quickly get unweildy and prove to
be much more confusing than multiple options pages. Linking to your
plugin's particular option on the page with an anchor isn't great
either.

Sabin's and Stephen's suggestion for a standardised link to each
plugin's options page in the plugin screen is excellent.

Definitely the best solution. Lets the manage/options distinction
remain and have meaning while also letting users only have to check
one place (and only click once to get there, which is nice) to find
any special plugin related pane. Two clicks and you're there, with no
confusion or risks of long unweildy pages.

We still might consider a distinction (to be made by each plugin's  
programmer) between plugins that are "Set and Forget" ("SaF") and  
those that require a persistent Options page.

Thus, the first group would have an options page that ONLY is linked  
from the Plugins page, while the latter will have the usual link  
under the Options "tabs".  There are a lot of SaF plugins that simply  
need a path set or something, and _really_ don't need a full Options  
page cluttering things up.  Make this easier to do, and you will  
discourage plugins that ask the user to text-edit the plugin file to  
set that one setting.

If JavaScript is available, clicking an SaF options link could maybe  
use some Ajaxy goodness to display the one-or-two options right there  
in the plugin screen.  Sans JavaScript it would of course do a reload  
to a full page for those options.

I think that difference between two areas would be just between  
configuration options and daily-tweakable options, which would be  
like a hint to plugins end-user on how to approach those options  
("set-and-forget" plugins vs. "tweak-as-much-as-you-can" plugins).

Many plugin I wrote or I use would definitively use this set-and- 
forget mechanic. I think this is a good way..

For example, plugins like UTW or Search-All have a second link for  
editing alongside 'activate' in plugins page. this would be the right  
standard place to make those install-options accessible, I guess...

Nope, I don't think the edit link is there because the plugin supports
it, but because the plugin is writable by the web server.

If I remember correctly, it adjusts both robots.txt and stops pinging.
Though, I may be wrong.

(And it can only do robots.txt if WP is installed in the DocumentRoot of
the server.)

I imagine the interface could look something like the "edit / create Post"
page, so we can build off of the existing UI look-and-feel and tools.
Simply make the "plugin options" page looks like the "edit/create post"
page, and have everything saved through one save button at the bottom.

How is this page going to look and function when Javascript is disabled?


Much like the "edit / create post" page with JS disabled.

WP's Movable Type importer currently ignore the Keywords field in MT  
export files, which is unfortunate when you want to convert a client  
who's been on MT for years and wants to switch, but isn't willing to  
lose their tagging system.

I've modified wp-admin/import/mt.php to successfully convert MT  
keywords to WordPress postmeta  as a "keywords" field (UTW then does  
a good job of converting these fields to tags).

Is there enough demand out there for something like this that I  
should consider submitting a patch? If there's no chance of it being  
accepted, I'll just post the patch in some forums.

Thanks,
Scot

Yes, please submit a ticket with a sample import file (and a patch
against trunk using the new tagging system ;-)). This is very relevant
with the tagging being added to trunk.

against trunk using the new tagging system ;-)). This is very relevant
with the tagging being added to trunk.

Thank you,

If you're not the server admin, you might ask your host what this
message means and why it has been triggered. (Maybe the uptime of the
process is too long.)

If you're the server admin, well... then you ought to know where the
message comes from. ;-)

Alex

The reason I've  got them  going into  postmeta  keywords rather   
than straight  to  tags is  that people use  MT keywords for all   
sorts of things, not necessarily tagging systems.

For example: On one MT system  I run, a small  handful  of  students   
posts stories on behalf of a  hundred  others.  But the bylines  of  
those stories need  to be those of the authors, not the posters. So  
we enter:

name=John Doe
email=john@doe.com

in the MT keywords field and a plugin/template change takes  care of  
the byline. If  I  were to convert  that  site to WP, I wouldn't   
want  those items to become tags, but would  want them  kept as  
metadata.

Maybe that  system is an extreme minority case, but I  suspect a lot  
of people are using  MT keywords for all sorts of non-taggy purposes.  
So I'm inclined to keep  my importer modification as it is and not  
go  straight to tags. Agree  or  disagree?

It would however  be a good  idea for WP's tagging system to emulate  
UTW's ability  to convert  postmeta data, so the admin has  the  
option to  convert  to  tags  after  initial  import.

Scot

The privacy option does four things:

1. Adds a <meta name='robots' content='noindex,nofollow' /> to all
pages (if they call wp_head, anyway).

2. Causes hits to robots.txt to send back:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
This only works if a) WP is in the site root and b) no robots.txt
already exists.

3. Stops pings to ping-o-matic and any other RPC ping services
specified. This works by having the function privacy_ping_filter()
remove the sites to ping from the list. This filter is added by having
add_filter('option_ping_sites', 'privacy_ping_filter'); in the
default-filters. When the generic_ping function attempts to get the
ping_sites option, this filter blocks it from returning anything.

4. Hides the ping sites option entirely on the Options->writing page.

Are concerns over spam is really warranted here. We all put up with spam 
in other open systems, like blog comments and email (and have come up 
with very good counter measures - like akismet). I can see how they 
(wp.com) would want users to continue using their service, since that's 
why they set it up.

I wonder if there is a place for a plugin, or something along those 
lines that would create a similar community feel (and features) amongst 
distributed blogs, rather than just between blogs hosted by wp.com.

Just a thought,

Kevin N.

Thanks, that's great to know it does all that. And it even works without a
robots.txt. Neat. :)

I still wonder, though, if it couldn't be better explained during set up.
The wording by the checkbox is misleading as to what happens when you check
it. The implication is that search engines are the only thing affected, when
in reality it's both robots.txt AND ping. You get both or neither, with one
check mark.

So it works great if you want total privacy, or no privacy, but there is no
middle ground -- that is, it's not explained or offered during set up. I
imagine lots of people want the search engines to find them eventually (so
they say "yes" during set up), but don't want to alert Ping-O-Matic right
out of the gate  -- but they don't know that option means "yes to ping"
also, because it never says or even implies that. If they KNEW they were
agreeing to both, they might make a different choice, then go in and make
manual changes to admin once they get WP installed.

Maybe there should be two options in set up:
_ I want search engines to visit my site.
_ I want to alert Ping-O-Matic every time I make a post.

At least this way the new user can see that there are two options, rather
than having both options turned off or on, without realizing what's
happening.

Marci :)

Hi all, I'd like to know if this one is a bug or something wrong with my blog. I was trying some tools of my template and disabled javascript on Firefox. Then I tried to delete a comment and it uses an URL which starts with

http://www.duechiacchiere.it/wp-admin/ocomment.php?action=deletecomment [...]

The file ocomment.php is not found, and a 404 error is thrown.

Add the line 

define('WP_RELOCATE', 'true');

to your wp-config.php (sic!), then log in via wp-login.php and go to the
Options page to change home and siteurl.

It's good that you ask... I'm also waiting, yet only for two days now.
However, feels like a little eternity, for internet measures.

And, yes, I also want to participate in the plugin competition. ;)

Subject: [wp-hackers] ajaxcat script enqueue, and the future of wp-cats
Message-ID: <d9b01a0706151007t306285bbj5979cbcb3eb6e369@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm the author and maintainer of the WP-Cats plugin, and I just wanted
to find out from the core devs what the story is with it. The last two
point releases have broken the functionality, and I noticed that the
admin-header.php page now includes this line:

wp_enqueue_script( 'ajaxcat' );

If you guys are rolling this functionality into core, that's fine, but
please get it launched so I don't have to fight an uphill battle
against core changes. (Or, stop fiddling with the backend markup
structure and class names, which breaks ajax enhancement plugins.)

Thanks,

Mike

Btw Mike, Your plugin is excellent and to have it in the core would be a
smart move for WP.

Hi, Gali

You should also consider the users of WPMU blogs, where these options
have to be in the SQL database.

G,

Just curious if you can execute a SQL command. Assuming yes since you  
seem to be dumping the DB and importing it. If so why not just run  
the SQL replace command to update the two wp_options fields. I run  
something similar. I develop the WP site and enter some of the dummy  
content on my laptop. I then dump the DB and push everything to a  
live server for client QA. So all references in the wp_options (both  
of them) and the guid and post_content need to be updated with the  
live URL.

I generally just add the lines to be executed on the live server that  
loads the DB dump. And I agree and question why WP needs to store the  
full URL instead of building it dynamic when needed. Seems  that  
storing the relative URL path and appending the host part would make  
this easier. At least for the wp_posts items anyway.

[string_to_find] is something like 'http://local.www.mysiite.com'
[string_to_replace] is something like 'http://www.mysite.com'

UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = replace(option_value,  
'[string_to_find]','[string_to_replace]') WHERE option_name='siteurl';
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = replace(option_value,  
'[string_to_find]','[string_to_replace]') WHERE option_name='home';

UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = replace(guid,  
'[string_to_find]','[string_to_replace]');
UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace(post_content,  
'[string_to_find]','[string_to_replace]');

private stuff.  I also found out that I have the mozilla firefox supposed

Darn.  I know I just saw a WordPress plugin that PGP-encrypts your
entire life, including cats, dogs and mitochondrial DNA last week, but
I lost the URL.

Seriously, what the heck kind of questions is that?

Let me simplyfy here so you can understand.  I want all my pin numbers and
my codes that I type into my bank site to be erased off the computer when I
erase them.  So that the administrator has no entry into my yahoo or hotmail
or my bank account.  You gyes out there must have knowledge How I can
safeguard my pin numbers and codes to my bank sites and my hotmail, yahoo,
and anything else that is considered private.

It is a pity this WordPress plugin that PGP-encrypts your
entire life does not encrypt the administrators brain, or do you know of
something that can do just what I requested now.

Thanks a heap Doug

You misunderstand my sarcasm.

This list is in no way an appropriate forum for discussing the

Sounds like a domestic conflict, not a security problem.  Let's be
charitable and pretend to help:

If your partner has physical access to the computer there is absolutely no
way, NONE, of securing or "erasing" any information that passes through it.
Go to a public library and use their computers.

My  apologies about my sharp tongue, I am just really peeved at this point.
Normally I am quite a nice person, but not when my privacy has been invaded.

Has anybody got a few suggestions, except to take a gun and shoot the
administrator.  That I am afraid wont work.  He has no life insurance, and
he has to buy the groceries tomorrow.

Thanks
Odette

Your mistake in posting to this group is understandable. You are not
the first to have thought that the members would be interesting in
"hacking" problems such as yours. However, this list is called
wp-hackers (the "wp" is short for "WordPress" which is the name of a
software package) and so we are not interested in your privacy
problem.

The best advice I can give you is this: you should contact your bank
and your lawyer to remedy the problem and find a local computer
security expert to help you manage your private information.

Cheers,
Andy

Maybe he has a VIP account (like Scoble), which affords one more  
liberties.

But really, we've strayed away from wp-hackers material (I know, I  
know, I sort of started it... my mistake).

That's a pretty sweet plugin, it'd be interesting to have that sort of 
functionality available in core, even without a GUI.

neat.

it can also be used a a descent syntax highlighting for code inside
posts (just make the textarea read-only).

if we add this, I suggest that we make it optional its a bit quirky.

There is a need for better <code>...</code> handling. With syntax
highlighting, file captions, line numbers, etc.  So, yes, please,

I've wondered about this myself.  Is reading the string out of the  
database faster than getting the current domain/path via PHP?  I  
can't see any reason for this to be in the database - I'm sure there  
was a decision behind it, but I'm curious.

Wouldn't it be easier to set a constant from the index.php file?

I don't think this CodePress has anything to do with that.

CodePress looks like a client-side JavaScript syntax highlighter. What
you're referring to within <code> tags would be handled server-side.

CodePress front page says: " CodePress is web-based source code editor
with syntax highlighting written in JavaScript that colors text in
real time while it's being typed in the browser."

Web-based.

Also, installation instructions at http://codepress.org/install.php
say that one should download the script and install it on a webserver.

Sounds to me like an excellent thing to be integrated with WordPress.
Both standalone and WordPress.com hosted.

I see it as a [code] button in the editor.  I press it, I get to edit
some code with CodePress (either in a popup window, or in another
textarea, or whatever), and then I click something like [Copy to post]
to get the formatted and highlighted code that I wrote into my post.

It sounds too cool to be true. But then again with WordPress... :)

Ah, I see what you mean now. If it could be an extension to TinyMCE,
that would be useful.

take advantage of Wordpress comments. (The old, handrolled sites don't 
support comments.)

I only really need to enable this for new posts going forward.

I've found two plug-ins that should be able to do this: WP-Autoblog and 
Feed Wordpress. Does anyone have opinions about these? Stability, 
features, configurability, robustness, etc.?

That is, is there any good reason to choose one over the other?

While looking for a date widget for FireStats, I stumbled into this
lovely LGPL javascript date widget:

WordPress users manipulate dates in a few places (post publication time
for example), and using this widget will simplify the UI, while making
it cooler at the same time.

Message-ID: <4673F166.1080303@metalab.unc.edu>

I'm having trouble using any permalink structure except the default 
query string format on a new blog. What's weird is that WordPress 2.1.3 
tells me to add these rules to my.htaccess file:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>

However if I change the permalink structure to use dates or not use 
dates, it tells me to add the exact same rules. It never changes the 
rules to match the permalinks!

This can't be right, can it? What should I expect to see in mod_rewrite 
for different permalink structures?

This is the case whether I make the changes manually or make the file 
writable so WordPress can do it directly.

Any ideas?

It is. :-) WordPress handles all of that internally, after the rewrite. The
box is just there to make things simpler for people who don't have .htaccess
read-write, and those who host somewhere other than / ... What error do you
get with the other permalink structures?

Those are the default WordPress rules. Whatever permalink settings you have, those won't change.

What happens is that rather than using a full set of .htaccess directives, processing is passed to WP through index.php.

Have you verified that mod_rewrite is functioning?

Other WordPress blogs on the same server and Apache instance are 
functioning just fine with similar rewrites. I'm not sure what's 
different about this one.

Is there any sort of logging inside WordPress I can turn on to see 
what's happening? I'm not seeing any PHP errors.

Jeremy is correct.  You'll note that Codepress also says that it is  
entirely JavaScript, and can be tested on a local machine without a  
server.

That's exactly how I see it.  You click on the code button and a  
window pops up with a textarea and the row of Language buttons along  
the top.  You type in your code, then hit "okay" and the code --  
converted to HTML entities and marked up for formatting -- is pasted  
back into the post.

I don't think CodePress's "Get code" function actually returns the  
"formatted" code, so some voodoo would have to happen there to get  
the formatted code back to the post edit screen.  Also, the Codepress  
CSS files would have to be integrated into the WordPress CSS that  
displays with posts.

This might be better as a plugin instead of rolling into core, since  
most bloggers probably never go near displaying code in posts.

*****
RELATED QUESTION: Can anyone direct me to some instruction on writing  
a plugin that adds a button to the post editor?  I've found a  
different plugin that adds posts to the HTML editor*, but since  
ButtonSnap stopped working I can't find a way to add buttons to the  
Rich Text editor.

Also, instruction or hints about using a plugin to add buttons that  
do custom actions -- like the "Link" button that pops up a dialog to  
fill in?

Here are a couple example of plugins that do this nicely -- but  
"manually".  We should roll this type of Configuration link into the  
core....

DoFollow:
<http://kimmo.suominen.com/sw/dofollow/>
Disable the ?nofollow? tagging for comments. Timeout using comment  
age inspired by Christoph Rummel. Configuration: Options ? DoFollow.  
By Kimmo Suominen.

JavaScript Pull-Quotes:
<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/features/wp-javascript-pull- 
quotes/>
Allows you to create flexible customizable pull-quotes without  
duplicating text in your markup. Configuration: Presentation ? Pull- 
Quotes. By Stephen Rider.

Yes, that second one is mine.  I simply typed the link into the  
main .php files's description paragraph like so:

Description: Allows you to create flexible customizable pull-quotes  
without duplicating text in your markup.  <strong>Configuration: <a  
href="themes.php?page=jspullquotes.php">Presentation &raquo; Pull- 
Quotes</a></strong>.

What we should do is standardize the link like so:

Description: blah blah blah text in your markup.
Configuration: themes.php?page=jspullquotes.php

...and WordPress could programatically figure out the "naming" or the  
path (e.g. "Presentation > Pull-Quotes" or "Options > DoFollow")

CORRECTION:
Jeremy was _partially_ correct.  Specifically, he is right that  
Codepress doesn't have to run on a server.

We've noticed that most (if not all) of the VIP accounts have their
CSS files in a labeled vip subdirectory. (ie it's part of the URL)

We've not found one that didn't have that in some way and we don't
know if that's 100% true or not.

That's what we've discussed in the support forums though.

I know it sounds silly but what usually fixes it when I see that occur
on my client's installs is viewing the permalink options page and
clicking on that Save Changes button again.

Seem to have to do it also with mu setups as well after one runs an
import as well.

Hope this helps,

That is very cool, and IMO it would be a great replacement of the
implementation we have now.

Any volunteers? :)

It's slick looking, and for dates I think it's nice, but the time 
selector is really weird and not intuitive at all.

One problem with that though is the "Plugins used" plugins that take
the description of the plugin and displays it to your visitors.
Granted, they can't get access but it still looks kind of sloppy.

I agree.

we can either use it for dates only and keep some simple html fields for
the time or modify it so that the time selection is also nice (its LGPL).

its very flexible, and the time selector is optional.


its has two modes which we can use:

1. flat embedded, which good for the calendar widget.

2. popup window, which is good ot select dates in forms etc.

Message-ID: <b88434820706161341y4f3d71ect18ecd3a42fec6e1d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I noticed that the MD5 for WordPress 2.2 on WP.Org (
http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.2.md5) is different from that of the one I
downloaded. The MD5 I get from the WordPress 2.2 ZIP is:

1c59770eeb66fb8471b6131acf136283

Is the MD5 wrong on the WP.Org site?

Thanks,

Thanks for confirming that.

Also, the Release Archive page still says that 2.1 is the lastest release
series... That needs to be updated.

That's the md5 for the zip.

http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.2.md5 has the md5 for the tar.gz.  I
know, it's confusing.  We should show both md5s.

I downloaded both package and diffed against the 2.2 svn tag as a
precaution.  Everything looks fine.

I thought that might be why, but I download the .tar.gz also, but the MD5 is
still different:

Message-ID: <df41a9470706161613o15b458d6g67298e271f1bfb37@mail.gmail.com>

I just noticed I can't upload any patch file to wordpress; wondering why,
it leads me to this snippet:

function wp_check_filetype($filename, $mimes = null) {
        // Accepted MIME types are set here as PCRE unless provided.
        $mimes = is_array($mimes) ? $mimes :
apply_filters('upload_mimes', array (
                'jpg|jpeg|jpe' => 'image/jpeg',
                'gif' => 'image/gif',
                'png' => 'image/png',
                'bmp' => 'image/bmp',
                'tif|tiff' => 'image/tiff',
                ......

Is it _vital_ to list all possible mime types this way, instead of
blacklisting some?
Right now:

- No patch (ending in .patch or .diff) can be uploaded.
- Not to mention ALL OpenDocument formats and PostScript
- Nor can certain multimedia formats be uploaded, like .flv (flash movie),
.ape (monkey's audio), and a zillion others
- As well as quite a few compression formats like .bz2, .7z, .arj, .rar, ......
- And package formats like .rpm, .deb, .msi, .......
- Anybody want me to list 100 more?

I'd suggest blacklisting rather than whitelisting, it's infinitely tiresome.

+1

Provide API functions that plugins can use to add custom field GUI.   
Text, checkbox, radio buttons, etc.  Ability to specify a filter  
callback for data validation.  Ability to specify default data for  
required fields.  Automatically take care of a custom nonce form  
field to prevent updates on non-wp-admin firing of the save hooks.

I throw together a lot of plugins that hinge on custom fields... but  
it's a royal pain to code an interface for each one.  So I usually  
don't. :-)

Discussing WP.com policy on the WP.com support forums seems futile as  
the forums are manned by volunteers (like Dr. Mike in the reply  
before this one) who can't give authoritative answers.  It'll  
probably result in the thread getting locked (because it wastes time  
that could be spent dealing with support issues), so going that route  
is just going to give you heartburn.

Thanks for all you SQL tricks about changing the options after an import.
That's NOT what I was looking for (and NOT what you should be doing, btw).

On a SQL export, I want to move the content, not the meta data.

Computer Guru showed the best solution, by putting the option in a
file (like OsCommerce - ok, not a coding reference :D)

Excluding MU users I see no interest in keeping this option in the db.

Stephen : I thought about it too { for the db settings... if
($_server[path] == localhost) then... else...() }

Well, it's the best of both worlds. You can override the settings in the
database by defining siteurl and home in wp-config.php. So, if you don't
want the settings to be in the DB, put them in the config file.

Whitelisting is much safer from a security point of view.

Adding extra mime-types is simple - the list is passed to the
upload_mimes filter [1] for you to easyily modify from a plugin.

At least one plugin is available to allow you to configure extra
mime_types from within WordPress [2]

Message-ID: <4674F6BE.5080104@yadan.net>

I created a system test page for FireStats (screenshot: 
http://yadan.net/omry/systest.png)


Some of the things it checks are:

* Files integrity (Checks that all the files exists and and warn if 
files are modified (depends on an md5 files list generated automatically 
as a part of the build process)).

* PHP version.

* Database connectivity and version.


I think something like this can be a valuable tool to help users 
troubleshoot problems.

Feel free to use ideas and code from FireStats:

OK, if it's from security POV, then I'd tend to agree as well.

Thanks a lot for the pointer. Though I guess I would still file
a ticket and get some common mime types incorporated upstream,
that would make some people's life easier.

Yes please! I'm just getting crazy on a plugin which, with those  
hooks, would be an easy ride. :-))
I think that the more hooks we can provide to authors, the more CMSy  
plugin would be written, and I feel this is the way to work.
absolutely +++++1 for me, even if I'm just a newbie :-)

If you are moving the content (wp_content) you are best to also move  
the wp_postmeta. IF changes made to the content that affects the  
template, attachments, custom fields they are stored in the  
wp_postmeta table. Otherwise your two systems are out of sync.

I'm interested in this approach. Is this actually documented  
somewhere?? Is this a define() setting or just WP_HOME="http://....'.  
I did a search on the two keywords WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL in the WP  
codebase and found nothing.

I'm interested in what is affected as far as the actual records of  
the wp_posts table namely the guid field. So when the DB records are  
imported and someone hits the HOME URL are the values for the guid  
field converted to the WP_HOME URL defined in the wp-config.php file?

Hola all,
just a quick question I can't find answer anywhere: I used to know  
that since wp 2.1 it deals internally changed slugs for posts, and I  
can find a whole literature online for that... but what about pages?

I just discovered that actually it can't manage changed page slugs,  
nor I can find any plugin that deal with pages..  More: why I can't  
even make a rewrite in htaccess for pages? It works on posts, but it  
shows 404 for all the old pages...

Do you know something useful I don't know, or I just blasted whithout  
remedy some mid-hi pagerank pages? :-)

Thank you

If no better solution arises, you should be able to htacces rewrite
old_url to new_url (htaccess is supposed to  work here)

Yes, it's supposed to, but actually it don't work, maybe I'm suck at  
rewriting, but this rule works for legacy posts:

RewriteRule ^10$ /network/      [R=301,L]

but this rule DON'T work for this page:

RewriteRule ^/radio-e-multimedia/$ 	/radio/      [R=301,L]

even if I've tweaked in a million ways...
It's my rewrite bad , or there's something I can't catch?

Thank you

It was not and has not been done for pages yet.
Ticket #4328 Redirect Old Slugs feature needs to redirect slugs for
pages, not just posts, and redirect old permalink structure

Finally I've made it with Redirection plugin:

It's really really good at this and more.

Thank you anyway!

Message-ID: <ADF1D789-9F10-494F-AA22-99096C423B1C@yellowswordfish.com>

I asked three or four weeks back if anyone had any idea why one user  
of my forum plugin was not seeing the admin menu (under 'Manage').  
This went unresolved but there is something weird going on so I  
thought I'd have another go to see if anyone had any ideas.

I now have three users with this problem (out of a large number who  
don't) - two are using 2.2 and one 2.1. The only thing they seem to  
have in common is they are all using MySQL 4.1.20 - and, what's more,  
the activate hook that creates the tables is also either failing, or,  
MySQL 4.1.20 doesn't want to do it. So these three end up with no  
tables created, an incomplete activation of the plugin and no admin  
menu!

The questions raised by this are - why should 4.1.20 fail to create  
the tables and why should this stop the menu from being created. I  
can see no relationship between the db and the menuing system. Plus,  
in all cases, the plugin appears correctly in the 'active_plugins'  
option record.

I would really like to sort this out if possible but I am completely  
stuck for ideas. Can anyone advise? (On my original query I had  
responses to do with the activate hook usage and the add_submenu_page  
usage but these work fine 99.9% of the time and are correct.  
Something else seems to be in play here).

As an extra item, I tried the simple expedient in testing of forcing  
the tables to fail via code. This led to the plugin activation page  
returning the message: 'Plugin could not be activated because it  
triggered a fatal error' but it WAS in fact activated (albeit  
crippled) and I still got the menu appearing! I assume this is a bug  
in the plugin activation code.

This is driving me nuts and my hair is turning white. OK - it was  
already white but now it's falling out. Can anyone point me in the  
right direction?

Andy

Do any of your other users use MySQL 4.1.20 and NOT have the problem? If
not, get your users on MySQL 4.1.21 or MySQL 5.x. It could be a bug in MySQL
4.1.20...

That's not something I'm ever really going to know. Yes - it  
certainly looks like 4.1.20 has a table creation problem and if I  
find what it is I can cater for it. But that still doesn't explain  
the missing menu which is the real puzzle.

Now there's a question. It seems most unlikely but I can sure ask  
them. They are not all in the same countries but that's not  
conclusive. It would be an enormous co-incidence if they were!

Hello,

Where is the code for the smilies in WP 2.2? It used to be in
wp-includes/var.php, but no longer is.

Thanks,
Matt

yeah, if we include it in the description; if we define a new header 
field, the link could be displayed only in the plugin list. I suggested 
a while ago some hooks to allow for customizations to the plug-in 
metadata and plug-in list display; in the good tradition of Wordpress 
development, they received no feedback at all, since they are mere 
enhancement suggestions, not meltdown causing bugs.

here are a few wild guesses:

1. could be a php memory issue, try to increase the limit  
(http://firestats.cc/wiki/PHPMemory)

2. make sure there is no permission problem with any of the files.

3.ask them they got any php errors in the server error log.

Message-ID: <1182149867.m2f.35368@www.galleryembedded.com>

Other than hacking the Write Post / Write Page, I cannot see any way to make the upload tab, collapsible..

Any reasons why the Upload Tab is not collapsible (with default state, collapsed), it is a serious waste of screen space or if it is possible without hacking to make it collapsible..

Matt, you may be interested in the plugin I released today:

  http://jeremy.sunriseroad.net/projects/tango-emotes/

It has an example of replacing the smileys via a plugin that may be useful.

*Boh*, I just wrote and registered tango-smilies yesterday. :-) 404 on the
tarball, btw.

I noticed you suggest to install the code in mu-plugins and the resources in
plugins -> is that a well-understood WPMU plugin pattern? I've been writing
my WPMU-compatible plugins to expect code in mu-plugins and the resources in
a subdirectory.

Here's a link to my (as yet unreleased on wordpress.org) tango-smilies one:

  http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/2007/tango-smilies.zip

(Also a preview of my bug-links plugin in that directory too.)

Thanks,

- Jeff

No, that is not a common pattern. I just thought it would make it easier
to install on WPMU so that you wouldn't have to modify the plugin file.

When modifying WP plugins to work with WPMU, I frequently do it that
way, simply because there's less modifying of plugins for me to do,
which makes for easier upgrading of the plugin.

> *Boh*, I just wrote and registered tango-smilies yesterday.

*Boh*, I actually wrote my plugin a few weeks ago, but only released it
today. :)

Oh, did you register it on the WordPress plugin browser? I didn't do
that for mine, because there is a GPL requirement on the plugins hosted
there, and the Tango smilies are CC-BY-SA, which is not compatible with GPL.

Message-ID: <d6ca156f0706180630o7d169a6bq450ce0c106ccf78c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i am coding a plugin that uses the wp_head, login_head,
admin_head, rss_head, rss2_head, atom_head, rdf_header and rss2_head
to _preg_replace_ any information about the version of WordPress that
some site is running to evade the Wordpress Vulnerability scanner made
by David Kierznowski[1]

I have code some PHP to replace everything but some files are not
processed with these hooks.
- wp-commentsrss2.php doesnt lauch the rss2_head hook action
- the wp-install.php and wp-upgrade.php dont be affected by the admin_head
- wp-links-opml.php doesnt have any hook to manipulate it and uses
$wp_version instead of bloginfo('version');

Probally the solution of all my problems is create a filter to
bloginfo, but as i say before, the wp-links-opml.php doesnt use it.

How can i do it? Thanks.

May want to check that as I believe Donncha has changed the code now
to have the plugin subdirectory an internal variable:

Hope this helps,

That at least provides a non-magic-string way of getting the directory name,
but plugin authors still have to write code to figure out where their plugin
is installed on the filesystem and as an URL path (which is easy enough with
dirname(__FILE__), but it's still up to the plugin author -- there's no dumb
"where is my plugin, I don't care if I'm on WPSO or WPMU!" API that everyone
can use in ignorant bliss).

Definite +1 on the custom field integration.

It should include a distinction between fields added to editors for  
Posts, Pages, or Both.

(I was easily able to hack the plugin to also add the fields to  
Pages.  As-is, it only adds them to the Post edit screen.  I wouldn't  
readily know how to make different sets of fields appear on each of  
those screens though....)

You beat me to it!  ;)  The Options page link should be a plugin  
header item just as "Author" and "Author URI" is.  In the same way,  
it can be integrated into the description paragraph in the Plugins  
page but be left out elsewhere....

Wasn't aware of those "display the description" plugins.  I might  
have to reconsider having that link there for the time being.  All  
the more reason to do this!  :)

heh heh.  Sounds familiar. ;)

One of the display plugins plugin (Vipers?) allows for editing of the
description for display.

I hate bottom posting.

What about doing it like Donncha does it and checks to see if the
variable is defined?  If I understand it correctly, that variable is
only used in wpmu.

You see how that means plugin authors still have to care, right? :-)

(I'm not angling for a solution, just pointing out that the problem exists.)

If this could be a SVN post-commit hook that'd be amazing.

No need for that.

I don't know how you create the distributed archive right now, but if
you will use some script to do it you will have a place to do some nice
things, for example:

* replacing some macros in the code, version number is a typical example.

* creating the md5 list file prior to distributing.

I use this simple script to generate the list file (which takes the
directory with the files as an argument) :


md5list.sh:

#!/bin/bash

cd $1
for i in $( find -type f); do
        FILE=${i:2}
        echo `md5sum -b $FILE` >> md5.lst
done



you can use the from my systest page to validate the files.

Maybe because the upload "tab" is an iframe.

Message-ID: <a6128e200706181432h5f5e40f7r7830b5507484782b@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone know why it's still called Blogroll in admin, when it's called
Bookmarks in functions (wp_list_bookmarks) and yet displays by default as a
list of "Links" in the sidebar?? Maybe it's time to streamline this -- call
it all the same thing, or let the user choose per blog, so that it's
consistent everywhere. When I use WP as a CMS for a client, explaining that
Blogroll really means Links or Bookmarks is kinda distracting and seems
unprofessional. I  usually just change the core so it reads differently, so
the client does not misunderstand it. Anyone else see a use for this kind of
change?

I managed to survive with Custom Admin Menu plugin, which allows to
hide and/or rename administration menu items.  The plugin is available
from here:

http://barunsingh.com/software/custom-admin-menu/

There is also a screencast/video which demonstrates how the plugin works.

But I do agree with you - this area could use some consistency. And
I'd much rather have it as "Links", which is a superset of both
"Bookmarks" and "Blogroll", and which is something regular people are
used to the most.

P.S.: I think there was a very similar thread on this list not so long
ago.  Wonder what happened to that. :)

I wrote a plugin to move the upload area into the collapsable tree  
like the custom fields, trackbacks, optional excerpt items on the  
Posts editor screen. Check it http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ 
relocate-file-upload-plugin/

Note: I have a bug in the code somewhere. In some cases you can't  
move/shuffle the items.

Subject: [wp-hackers] UI: too many widget sidebars?
Message-ID: <b76f24970706181513i338d480o178628375166e4da@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

Recently I've been working on a web site, which uses WordPress as a
web application platform.  Nothing to do with blogging at all.
Widgets came really handy.

In fact,  I switched the web site to be completely widgetized.  Front
page uses three sidebars (can we get a different name for these?) -
left, main, and right.  Then there is another one, which subsitutes
main area once the user logs into the web site.  And then there are
another two for other web site sections. (Conditional sidebars)

Many widgets are re-used from the place to place with slightly
different options.  And the best part is that the non-technical client
has full control of his web site layout (drag and drop, simple widget
options, etc).

There is an interface problem though which I haven't found how to
solve yet.  In Presentations -> Widgets screen, it gets too crowded
when the number of defined sidebars exceeds three.  Things get too
wide.  It's difficult to make sense of them.

I think that more and more people will start noticing this problem in
the nearest future, as widgets are so cool and gaining momentum.  So,
I suggest something is done about that interface before too many
people are disappointed. :)

I am not a big user interface designer or anything, so I don't know
any good way to fix it.  Two ideas that I had are:

1. Smaller sidebar boxes used in several rows.
2. Displaying only three sidebar boxes at any given time, but provide
next/previous sort of navigation (AJAX Gods?) to switch between
available sidebars.

P.S.: One thing I'd absolutely hate to do is edit core WordPress files. ;)

Hey that is nice concept (plugin) and exactly what Wordpress should be doing . How would you feel about opening up a TRAC ticket so we can get your work put back into core and make the upload tab collapsible by default, to finish tidying up the write post screen.

Sure I'll open a TRAC ticket (my first).

I agree! I posted here last Fall asking the same question. Didn't  
receive favorable responses.  Burns me using all that screen real  
estate for the upload feature that is used less than 5% of the time.  
I had actually made changes to core, forget which file, for the  
initial implementation. Then decided it could be dine as a plugin.

Thanks to both of you for the input. I tried the plugin, but it's not
working in 2.1.3. Too bad...it would fulfill something else I was just
wishing for earlier today, the ability to click fewer times to get to some
frequently used features!

Good to see that there is talk of broader changes that will affect the menu
overall. I hope 2.3 is more compatible with existing plugins, or that more
plugin developers get on board, or whatever it takes...I had to revert back
to 2.1.3 after upgrading to 2.2 because too many things I needed to do,
didn't work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Widgets and Roles
Message-ID: <122d4b4d0706181622t7585db3dva44adbaf8081d6b@mail.gmail.com>

This may be a forum question, but reading through the codex, I don't see a
glaring answer....

Now that widgets are in core, should they be separated out of the Themes sub
hierarchy, so that an editor can be granted privileges to edit Widget
sidebar content but not be able to edit theme files?  Is this currently
doable but not documented?  I've looked at the role manager plugin, and I
can grant the privilege to either switch themes (which doesn't allow for
widget management) or edit themes (which allows for widget management but
also allows for theme file editing).

Thanks in advance for any insight or discussion.

Sort of, we found DBX boxes with an iframe inside crashed some browsers, 
I don't remember which. (It was a looooong time ago.)

Matt was running for the plane, the plane. They don't appear to be on
the file server, so we will have to wait until he lands.

We have discussed this previously (I re-brought it up), but Matt decided to
roll this into a larger taxonomy discussion instead of this one-off.
However, I can't find any TRAC ticket and/or discussion on what this should
look like.

My guess would be - to collect stats of your visitors.  A tiny gif
image is better than a tiny javascript.

My guess is that the stats mechanism on wordpress.com relies on the
loading of that image.
Thats how the stats it generates requires no extra load on the blog
server, and how it works when caching plugins are installed.

I was a bit perplexed at first when i noticed this rather large smiley
face in the footer of my blog (was on a really low res screen at the time).

You are correct.

You can hide the smiley if you like
Just don't use display:none, try this code:
img#wpstats{width:0px;height:0px;padding:0px;border:none;overflow:hidden}

I actually don't know anything about this for sure, but I would hazard a
guess that they use an image because browsers generally download them
only once, as opposed to HTML pages, so you can measure hits versus visits.

Image download == visit.

Of course, I may be completely wrong.

Wouldn't img#wpstats {visibility: hidden;} also work?

Theoretically yes, but it is not supported across all browsers, so you
should stick to the workaround found on the FAQs, it is almost bulletproof.

Chris,
John Blackburn pointed out this link: Please see the latest comment on
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3695 but that discussion ends when Matt
says "it's going to happen". I'm not sure where it goes from there.

I'm with you on Links for the most part, b/c it's what most non-programmers
and non-bloggers think of when they think of what we call bookmarks or
blogroll. I do understand the position of those who have said "but these are
much more than links", but ultimately some of us have to deal with real
people who will connect best with the idea of Links.

I'm on the fence about bookmarks, but I'm definitely not liking blogroll,
just b/c I use WP as a CMS for most clients, so that title is totally
irrelevant to them, when they admin their own site. To the average user,
"bookmarks" are in browsers and word processors and spreadsheets, but
"links" are on websites, and take you from one website to another. So, all
(or most?) things considered, I'm still camping with the Links folks.

That said, it might be kinda cool to allow the user to choose their "label"
during set up, and that way everyone is happy. :)

Marci :)

Just a quick thought.....I'm not using widgets, but I do use Role Manager
(hurray for Thomas Schneiger who has taken it over!!). Have you tried
creating a new capability, per the instructions on Thomas' site? I can dig
up the link if you need it.

Have you tried it? IIRC visibility makes the element invisible but the
element still takes up space and affects layout.

CSS 2.1 Spec says:
"The 'visibility' property specifies whether the boxes generated by an
element are rendered. Invisible boxes still affect layout (set the
'display' property to 'none' to suppress box generation altogether)."

However, browsers have been known to skip loading any images falling
under a display:none rule. Thus using display:none will hurt your
stats. Forcing the image's dimensions to zero does not have this bad
effect. That explains the recommended CSS rule set.

If you want, you can try this instead:
img#wpstats {
width: 100%;
}

On http://andyskelton.com/ it really ties the page together.

Every time I find myself thinking make something an option or add it
to setup I have to catch myself, because the reality is that then most
people will not be happy.

In IE 5.5 and below it is rendered with inheritance, which is not the
expected behavior and if you have it nested on a positioned element it
doesn't work even in IE6.

Besides it has some problems in modern browsers too, due to the nature of
the property, a hidden element still takes up space on the flow so it can
cause your layout to break.

Yes, or you can use absolute positioning and then move it out of screen, it
depends on  your css skills, there are plenty of way of hiding an element on
the screen ad still have it load in the page ;)



On http://andyskelton.com/ it really ties the page together.

That's not exactly testing a complete range of browsers. Try IE 6, at
least...

Well, the issue at hand is that I don't see a hook for JUST editing
widgets.  It seems to be tied to Edit themes.  I would think that now that
widgets are core elements, they could be moved out of the Theme hierarchy
and given their own tab and hook.  Was hoping the idea would get some
traction here on this list first, before taking to trac.

I'll look there for more discussion now.

Thanks for the input.

I agree.  There should be a separation between themes and widgets,
both functionally (different access levels) and visually (another menu
item).

I'm using WordPress for web applications.  In most cases, clients
don't want or need to work with themes.  These come fixed.  But
widgets on the other hand, give them this nice control over how their
web site appears to be, without any possibility to actually break it
(in any case it won't be their fault, like with a theme).

So, count me as a +1 for this. :)

What with the semi-recent advent of "social bookmarking", I'd have to
disagree with you there. del.icio.us and other services all use the
term "bookmark". Think of it like a link with metadata. del.icio.us
bookmarks have metadata (tags, description, etc), WP bookmarks do too
(category, XFN, RSS feed, description, etc).

Also, when people say they want to know how to add a Link, what do you
think? That they want to add things to their blogroll, or that they
want to make links in a post? Using "Link" just creates excessive
support confusion.

What with the new taxonomy structure being worked out, perhaps a way
to give bookmarks multiple taxonomies will occur as well (multiple
categories, multiple tags, etc). The similarity to del.icio.us and
other social bookmarking services should be taken into account, as
should any changes being made to the taxonomy system before deciding
on what the thing should be called.

I'm sticking with Bookmarks, and I'll argue for that as long as they
are more than simple a href's.

I just joined this list a couple weeks ago, and I've liked some of  
the discussion I've seen.

Now I want to get down to brass tacks and get some of these ideas  
moving -- do some of the work myself and so forth, and possibly get  
it into "official" code.

Maybe you find something to start with in the bugtracker:

Docs are available in the Codex:

Hi Stephen,

Well met! As Alex G?nsche suggests confirming and then fixing some of
the existing bugs is the way to start. It demonstrates your
familiarity with the code and builds trust.

There's a really huge crowd of web users who don't even suspect that
their browser has bookmarking capabilities.  Bookmark is a foreign
concept for them.  Blogroll is a swear word.  They've recently
realized that Links are a cool concept for, well, linking pages to
each other...

Your world seems very different though. :)

IE6 loads the image. I guess the display:none issue was fixed by
loading the image via the javascript I forgot I wrote for that
purpose. So there's no problem with display:none. Sorry about the
false alarm.

I don't think it's own Tab is necessary. It's already under presentation,
and that's exactly what it does, edits the way the Sidebar(s) is/are
displayed (or presented). They are still related to the Theme to.

The same could be said about blogging 2 years ago.

  Bookmark is a foreign
> concept for them.


The very first browsers, from my own recollection, used either the term
"favorites" or "bookmarks"...

  Blogroll is a swear word.  They've recently

Therein lies the discussion.  As technology and the use of archiving "links"
to other sites grows, so does the nomenclature associated.

I agree with both the original poster in the sense that even within the
code, the naming convention isn't very consistent or semantic, as well with
Otto that the technology associated with the web has evolved into something
more than a basic HTML entity.  I also agree that a core ability to define
each "tab" within WP is bad idea, as always, that ability should be
relegated to a plugin.

Your world seems very different though. :)


That's what makes all of this fun and worthy of discussion :-D

Perhaps.  One of the reasons behind a separate tab for widgets is the
support for expanding use scenarios.  Right now, most people use
widgets for sidebar stuff.  But they are much more useful than that...

Sidebar groups come to mind - several sidebars (or better called
something like widget containers) grouped together and then used
according to some set of conditions (if (is_home() {
widget_container_group($main) } else {
widget_cotainer_group($secondary) })...

That would be the intended behavior, apparently. Which I actually use

I don't agree at all of widgets having their own tab. We have too many main
menu items as it is (Links/Bookmarks/Blogroll or whatever could even go
under Manage, IMO), and adding one for a feature some people (like myself)
don't even use seems very much in excess.

Also, I'm of the opinion that changing widgets is in the same "trust circle"
as managing widgets. I don't see much use at all for being able to
manipulate widgets, yet not be able to switch themes. I'm open to
discussion, however.

Normally a 1x1 transparent gif is used by most stat packages. WordPress 
likes to differ, why?
Maybe it is hoping a viral marketing campaign where people start asking 
about the image.

Have you considered using Google Analytics? In the latest incarnation it 
rocks.

Matt Mullenweg created that image while we were building the initial
version of the stats system in a cafe in Austin. He hasn't spoken
publicly about his artistic intentions. The simplicity and ample
negative space invites the viewer to participate by involving their
imaginations in the subjective creation of themes and purposes.

Yeah I was looking at buying it but these Google guys just aren't

I like this organization.  It looks clear and simple.

But it's for a different problem - a problem of too many widgets.  I
was more concerned with the problem of too many sidebars. :)

I don't know if it's intended or not, but I feel good about WordPress
using a visible image for tracking and doesn't hide away like others.
This way, a user knows that he is tracked, and can decide to protect his
privacy by blocking the image.

By the way, I don't block the image from stats.wordpress.org, yet I do
block anything from Google and their companies (Doubleclick, YouTube,
etc.).

Maybe you could use the 1x1 transparent gif?  It also has no semantic marker.

1. Subscribe to the WP-Trac mailing list (gives you updates on new  
tickets, modification to existing tickets)

2. Subscribe to the WP-SVN mailing lists (lets you know when new code  
gets committed)

3. Become familiar with SVN (subversion), download a client, checkout  
the entire WP branch locally

4. Create a ticket for a new issue, or go find an existing issue that  
lacks a patch

5. Keep your SVN checkout up to date by doing "svn up" or equivalent  
before starting work on a particular issue

6. Create patches by doing "svn di > ~/wp-patches/patchname.diff" or  
equivalent (we really appreciate it when patches are done relative to  
the root of the WP branch you are editing... so /trunk/ or /branches/ 
2.2/ e.g.)

7. Upload these patches to the correct ticket, and leave a comment  
announcing the patch and briefly describing what it does (this is  
important, because uploading an attachment doesn't generate an e-mail  
to WP-Trac)

8. Monitor the ticket for updates, answering any questions posed to you

9. Beam with pride when your patch is committed

10. Repeat!

Other tips:

* Peruse the WP source code to get a feel for the general coding  
style.  Mimic it.

* Don't be frustrated if some of your patches are sent back to you  
for additional work.  We're not mean people, just we want to help  
hone your skills.

* You don't need to take on mammoth tasks to impress us.  Go grab  
some low-lying fruit, especially in the beginning.

Oh, and welcome to the party! :-)

Yeah, my world is the real one. ;-)

My point was not about browsers, but people.  Yes, all browsers had
bookmarks forever.  But many people, even those who used the web for a
few years now, hardly know of this useful functionality.  And even if
they know, they don't use it.

It's like address books and reminders in mobile phones.  There are in
there for years now.  But there is still a huge crowd of people who
have no idea about this functions and how to use them.

> -I don't understand your "swear word" comment. It makes no sense.

I appologise. I live in a multicultural country. People often joke
here at those who speak rare languages, that they are just swearing -
they use a rare language so that nobody understands them.  Similarly,
with technical terms - many terms which you and I are very used to,
sound to many people foreign and aggressive.

> -If they know what a blogroll is, then they know what a "link" is, and it's probably something they click on to go to other sites, not something they think about having feeds and XFN and such.

That's the point.  They don't know what a blogroll is.  Even if they
use it every day.  Many of them don't know what a bookmark is, even
though they had it just front of their face for years...  For them, I
think, "link" is the most friendly and familiar term. :)

Yeah I thought this was decided and done. :(

There are at least three of you who are projecting your opinions and  
assumptions of "how people see the the web" as being fact, when in  
fact, there is no way for you, or I, to certain of any such thing, or  
lay down code that defines people's usage further.

The lowest common denominator here is "Links".
Blogrolls and bookmarks are types of Links. Both have very specific  
usage patterns and user behaviors associated to them.

And while every thing makes sense to somebody, in this case, do we  
really not agree that only one thing makes sense to *most* bodies,  
and that is "Links" (besides which, is a newbie web-user going to be  
exposed to this decision anyways? most of the impact of this decision  
is on the person/people using the admin no? and they ostensibly know  
what they are wanting to do: i wanna put links in my sidebar! links  
to what? oh my friend's blogs, some sites I like, etc)

XFN stuff should be hidden away in an options box.


Unless WordPress really wants to enforce the idea that it is *just* a  
weblog platform and that Links in the sidebar are only to weblogs of  
friends/of interest, or Bookmarks for keeping tabs on sites you want  
to remember.


"but these are much more than links"
no, in 99% of cases (e.g. when not adding XFN metacrap) they are not.

p.s.: RSS is glorified Live Bookmarks.
/me runs away howling wildly hehehehehe

I think we should go with "Links". Among the other reasons (which have, I
think, all been mentioned), it's shorter than "Bookmarks". Which will be
good for users with a low screen resolution (even if it does get moved under
"Manage", this reason is still there).

Also, XFN and the like are all additions to links. Does adding a target=""
to <a href> make it not a link? No, it doesn't. It's still a link
regardless. It's still using <a href="whatever"></a> and then it's just
adding attributes to that, or adding an image inside of the Links.

Message-ID: <1182381635.m2f.35521@www.galleryembedded.com>

I been getting a small number of "Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error." posts in the WPG2 forum.

Unfortunately change http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5239 executes a ob_end_clean() thus removing any error message making it impossible to debug what in their Wordpress Environment is causing the problem..

The issue is we need the error output, my suggestion would be to have a link in the plugin cannot be activated error message that allows the plugin activation to be simulated and the error output be displayed, but I am open for suggestions..

PS: Just a minor point,  I feel the assumption in the ticket, "Don't die because of output by badly-written plugins upon activation." is not ideal, if the WP plugin is a simple hello world then yes you should not be getting an output,  however take a plugin that integrates a another third party application and that assumption goes straight out the window because you have a whole lot of other factors to deal with.

Just a side note, but I believe there may be clues in the error_log.

But I think we should implement a custom, temporary error handler for
activating plugins so we can actually show something to the user, because a
blank screen and a cryptic message about a "fatal error" being "triggered"
doesn't help much, when you think about it ;).

I guess someones harvesting email addresses off of WP lists...

Your suggestion completes mine for existing plugins.

For me I am +1 on trapping errors by triggering extra php error trapping and capture / output those error messages, for my experience, relying on error_log's unfortunately is problematic as some hosting firms prevent real time access to error_log so I would always recommend having some kind of real time output in any case..

I would also recommend adding a hook on the plugin error event, like plugin activation so the individual plugin authors can also add addition code around plugin activation event..

I certainly would want to see something done quickly, at the very least a activation error hook (before) ob_end_clean() so at least we have a hope of capturing what is happening.

The same here at my plugin NextGEN Gallery. A couple of activation failed
based on the PHP memory_limit.

Would be good to know this kind of message or implement some memory_usage
checking before
activation ( If you near the memory_limit a warning could be shown)

On a related note: If you would like to log stuff into a global logging
facility without echoing to the client, there's now a plugin I wanted to
release the next days: WPsyslog. It's already finished, it's only some
organisational issues that keep me from releasing.

You can download it from:
http://www.zirona.com/download/wp-plugins/wpsyslog/wpsyslog-0.1b.zip
http://www.zirona.com/download/wp-plugins/wpsyslog/wpsyslog-0.1b.tar.bz2

Invoke it anywhere in your code by calling
wpsyslog('module', 'Error Message', [optional parameters]);

It will put your message in a database, and you can read the log table
on a separate page.

All further info is in the package (readme.txt and doc/specs.html).

Have a try and let me know what you think. The official release will be
in a couple of days.


Best regards,
Alex

The issue with trapping the error output is that its incredibly hard to
do..
Once a "Fatal" error occurs, the PHP script stops in its tracks, PHP Error
handlers CAN NOT do fatal errors, only notices/warnings(i think) and user
triggered errors.

The only way i can see would be to include a link somewhere that attempts
to activate the plugin, But doesnt do the redirections, Or somehow having
WP do a HTTP Request for the plugin activation page without the
redirection and display the result.

the Fatal error would be in the error log if its enabled in PHP, And for
that matter, If the user can access the error logs even.

(I aplogise for this not being in its sub-thread, I dont feel the need for
a new post for it.)

Unfortunatly if a "Fatal" error(to my knowledge the only error which trips
the error non-activation point) the ob_end_clean will never be run, yet
alone any other PHP code that we'd like to run.

As we know, this list comes quite highly in search results for 'hackers

It might be useful if the 'info' setting in mailman was filled in with a
useful description of what this list actually is so that it appeared on
the listinfo page.

Just my thoughts...

FYI,

I have fixed this. It turned out to be a bug in the Virtual Host section 
of my httpd.conf file. I had copied and pasted an old VHOST config, and 
modified a critical bit of information in one place but not another. A 
classic case of a DRY violation. Not, however, WordPress's fault.

I was about to mention the same thing. Gallery2's installer is really slick
and ensures that your install and all it's files are correct. Back in the
day when I had time to browse the support forums, I remember ever so many
posts where the solution was to reupload the file as it hadn't been properly
uploaded. Easily avoided with this.

Not to mention we could wrap the config maker into it. Make a full fledged
"noob" installer of sorts rather than just an installer that dumps the
defaults into the database.

This would be a big help IMO for the technology impaired.

Actually this is incorrect, you might want to have a look at the php manual under Error Handling and Logging Functions, php gives you a huge array of possible ways to trap errors and how to handle them..  However all that to one side, the issue here is not really just about errors it is *any* message that is generated during activation, including warnings etc..

As I posted, put a error action hook in place on activation and we will trap the messages on a plugin by plugin basis..  Hooks are cheap, just a line of code..

I kind of like how vBulletin does it. There's a normal type in / dropdown

date.

http://au2.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php

"The following error types cannot be handled with a user defined function:
E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_CORE_WARNING, E_COMPILE_ERROR,
E_COMPILE_WARNING, and most of E_STRICT raised in the file where
set_error_handler() is called.

If errors occur before the script is executed (e.g. on file uploads) the
custom error handler cannot be called since it is not registered at that
time."

I agree that other information printed by the plugin(not PHP Errors) would
be useful to pass through to the plugin activated page though..
Something like this:

"
Plugin activated. (Standard WP response)
This Plugin is a BETA release, Please report any errors to me at blah blah
blah (output of the Plugin script while being activated)
"
That way it could be handled on a more general plugin aspect, It doesnt
seem right plugin authors capturing the output of their plugins when being
activated, If you want to store the message for later, just store it
instead of echoing the message.

Wrong, and you fail at the internet. There is certainly a way to see
"how people see the web". It's called *looking*. Communication, it's
this radical new thing out there, where you talk to people, or you
read what they have to say, and then you know how they see things.
It's actually pretty clear what's going on, if you take the time to
look around a bit.

And we should go with the lowest common denominator... why, again?

In point of fact, I think we should not go with the lowest
commonality, but instead we should go with the flow and set new trends
ourselves. Wordpress is *the* most popular blogging platform out
there. It should be leading the pack in functionality and capability.
It should be implementing new standards and technologies. It should be
the one setting the course.

No, we do not agree on that. "Links" makes absolutely no sense,
because it's already being used for something else. Namely, it's being
used for LINKS IN POSTS.

I disagree, in the most extreme way. XFN and all those other options
should be moved up on the page to where they are more visible and you
don't have to scroll to find them.

If Wordpress was "just" a weblog platform, then it wouldn't have XFN
or other metadata at all. It wouldn't have any sort of options there.
I think your viewpoint is completely backward here.

Admittedly, XFN is limited in scope to blogrolls, which is why I'd
like it to be expanded to arbitrary metadata about the URLs in
general. I'd like the bookmarks section to become as robust as the
posts section, with arbitrary metadata, the ability to incorporate
them into the Loop, etc, etc... The whole "links" idea is a dead end.
If all you want is to stick links into the sidebar, hell, use html
inside a Text widget. Why have the section at all if you're going to
limit it to being nothing?

I'd support *removing* it before I'd support the kind of thing you're
describing.

Sorry it took so long to get in this here, but I'm going with a huge +1 
for "Bookmarks" too! Whoo Hoo! :D There's no point in having JUST 
"Links". Besides, it's already called "Bookmarks" in the wp-admin panel, 
for the area to "add" the bookmark links... ;) :) :D

I agree that 'bookmarks' makes much more sense than 'links'. What I'd
also love to see is the ability to have different metadata schemas
here in addition to XFN, in the same way you can output in different
syndicated formats.  If you wanted to use Dublin Core instead of XFN,
you could easily customize your Bookmarks metadata template, just as
you can easily customize your Feed template.

I think we all have valid points from each of our own perspectives. We're
never going to decide on the BEST option, because everyone differs in their
view of how the internet works, and what "most" people are doing with WP,
and whether we should be setting trends or doing what most people
understand.

Wordpress is an incredible blogging platform. Best ever. But we can't forget
that Wordpress is being used extensively as a CMS because it's incredibly
good at that too. I just talked to a lady yesterday who has three sites --
none of them blogs -- all built on WP. We've got a core platform that does
SO much cool stuff, that it evokes emotional debate from everyone who likes
what THEY do with it....and that is good. :)

I know the "lowest common denominator" concept is a little ugly sounding,
but as someone said, "Links" is short (good for a tab), and everyone knows
what it means. "Bookmarks" sounds like something personal to me: MY
bookmarks, sites I personally want to come back to....whereas everyone who
has any internet experience knows that "Links" take you to OTHER sites and
you put Links on your site to help OTHER people find what they are looking
for.  Bookmarks is just as bloggish as Blogroll (well, almost...) whereas
Links has a more universal meaning. Hmmm...if neither Bookmarks nor Links is
very accurate, then maybe we can call them xLinks or something....make up
our own term.....something that causes people to blink and wonder "how are
xLinks different from just Links?" Then we are being trendy and unique and
creating waves of change, as well as meeting the lowest common denominator
folks where they're at, and pushing them beyond their assumptions.

But maybe the real debate here isn't over Links or Bookmarks, but about what
WP actually IS. Is it a blogging platform, first and foremost, which some
people use as a CMS? Or is it the best CMS ever created for any purpose,
loved by bloggers and web developers alike for it's flexibility and
user-friendliness (how's that for a 90's term :P)? This is where we have to
"look around" and see how people are using WP. It's easy to say it's
primarily a blogging platform if you're an avid blogger and you hang in
those circles. If you're a web developer using it as a CMS, building sites
for clients who don't blog, then you're not going to "see" how many zillions
of bloggers are using it. That doesn't make anyone right or wrong, but it
makes it really hard to determine what WP really "is" and develop little
details like "links" or "bookmarks" based on that.

Maybe the only ones who can decide this are the developers themselves, not
the users and hackers. In which case perhaps we should just hand this back
over to Matt et al for their final decision about what WP "is". And all hail
the plugin developers who can put the ultimate functionality and decision
making back into the hands of the USERS -- whether they are bloggers or web
developers!

I don't agree that Bookmarks is bloggish at all. I'm using WP as a
CMS, and 'bookmarks' makes much more sense in the context of how I'm
using it than Links does. We have links on every page. They're all
different. Bookmarks are more universal, and can be called anywhere.

Bookmarks may seem more personal, but I don't see that as a strike
against them. As you said, they are YOUR bookmarks, sites you want to
personally come back to. That's what makes them special, and why they
warrant their own subsystem in WP. Links are just directions to other
sites, without any other meaning attached to them.

There's also the fact that 'links' is a term already in use in WP. If
we end up using 'links' rather than bookmarks, we're going to have to
rename the 'insert link' button in the editor, otherwise we're going
to confuse a lot of novices who have dutifully put all their links
into the 'link' section, and are now trying to add them to their posts
by clicking on the 'link' icon.

I agree, however I think 'widgets' should be the default tab, and
there should be distinct permissions for 'manage widgets' and 'manage
themes'.

Well you all have to remember though, either it be for a "personal" or 
as a "CMS" .. type site. Bookmarks seems so much better then just 
"links". Bookmarks represents "important" links to you the site owner, 
and highly visited links (by yourself) that you like and want others to 
check out and go to!

And please don't forget, that Bookmarks "name/title" whatever can always 
be edited in the wp-admin control panel. And plus, not every link will 
fit in under that "bookmarks" category section for links, and you'd make 
up other Link Category names too...

Actually, this is what prompted my question in the first place: we have
three different terms for it in use right now, and it's confusing which one
means what, or how each should be used. It sounds like you see two different
functionalities in WP right now....am I reading this right? If that's the
case I'd like to hear more and understand the differences. Thanks :)

And I agree that we have to be careful of the noobs and non-techies who use
WP. But it seems like some would disagree -- that we need to cater to the
techies, and let the rest of the world catch up. Again, something for the WP
core development team to decide, I guess. :)

It can be? Tell me where! That is all I was asking for initially.....so I
don't have to edit the core code to make it applicable to the end user. But
I've never seen anywhere that you could change that. A plugin was
recommended to me earlier in this thread, but it didn't work for me, and I
haven't had time to mess with it.

While we're at it, I think we should change "Posts" to "Words".   
After all, not all users are intuitively going to know what a "post"  
is, but everyone knows what "words" are.

Stephen Rider

P.S. -- I vote for "Bookmarks".

Bookmarks, when displayed on the page (using the wp_list_bookmarks()
function) generally get a title above them that corresponds to what
category the bookmarks are in. Rename the category, using
Manage->Categories, and that title changes as well.

The reason I like Bookmarks as a generic term is that the change has
already taken place internally. wp_list_bookmarks() is how you display
them. It gets them with get_bookmarks() The functions for all this is
located in bookmark.php and bookmark_template.php. All the old "links"
functions are still there, but most of them are deprecated.

We moved away from "links" for a reason: User Confusion.

Users are confused by the term "links". Read the support forums, look
for the questions of "How do I add links to my site?" The invariable
answer was "what do you mean, how do you add links to a post or how do
you add links to a sidebar or how do you add links to the theme, or
what?" and the user either never comes back or explains. Even worse,
somebody would read the question, explains how to add links to the
sidebar (using the "Links" menu) and then there would be much
confusion as the question asker tried to figure out why he had to go
to all that trouble to add a link to a post.

The name "Links" is simply wholly unacceptable. We've already learned
this, read the older threads in the support forums...

So the real choice is between "Bookmarks" or "Blogroll". Why it was
named "Blogroll" in 2.1, I'll never understand, but the choice seems
pretty clear to me. A Bookmark is a saved URL that you can have
displayed in a number of places. Perhaps on the sidebar (most likely),
perhaps in a page template (not as likely), or anywhere else you can
call wp_list_bookmarks() from.

It's the same thing, isn't it? By usage, widgets are a very big part of what
is shown to the user (the presentation).

I don't think it's the same thing. I have non-technical users who
couldn't hack HTML if their lives depended on it, but they know how to
drag-and-drop. I want them to drag-and-drop and rearrange the page,
but I don't want them being able to destroy the site accidentally by
deleting a div tag.

It's all presentation, but it's not all theming.

The capability that is currently shared between *switching* (NOT editing)
themes and widgets is manage_themes. Managing a theme includes widgets, if
your theme uses widgets, doesn't it?

I see widget configuration as a sibling to 'theme options', not as a
sibling to 'switch themes'.

Presentation
  -- Switch Themes & Edit Themes
  ----- Theme Options & Widget Layout

That's the logical permission hierarchy as I see it.

I agree.  I've actually been working on that in my head for a couple  
weeks.  Time to lay some code down. :-)

I'm embarrassed to be jumping into this thread, but Bookmarks/Favorites are
a browser feature.  Pages have "links", not "bookmarks" or "favorites".  You
bookmark a link, or add a link to favorites.

If this is a list of links, and it should be called that.  Calling it
Bookmarks/Favorites opens a whole can of confusion for people that already
use these terms for something else.

Oh, then what should book authors have said, when browsers introduced
the term *Book*mark for hyperreferences? ;-)

No, seriously... I think that "Bookmark" describes very well what we use
in WordPress. In terms of Semiotics, you could say, a Bookmark generally
is the sign for a position in a textual entity, and I think it meets
very well with all three usages (books, browsers, CMS).

Best regards,
Alex

Ha!  Touche.  But we call them "links", not hyperreferences...   :^)

I also don't understand the idea that they must be called Favorites (erm,
Bookmarks) because they're re-usable.  The "real" CMS I use uses Links, and
they're re-usable.  Adobe InDesign calls them Links, and they're reusable.

To preset the other side (just because I'm that kind of guy), Adobe
Dreamweaver calls them Favorites.

Hm....I kinda like hyperreferences. It's catchy, extra-long, and super
geeky-sounding. :) :) :)

And btw, I knew how to change the title of my bookmarks/links/etc in
Manage>Categories or in the templates or whatnot -- I do  that all the time.
I thought maybe someone knew how to change it in wp-admin, so the tab reads
something besides blogroll. As it is now, I alter that in the core if the
administrator day to day will be someone besides myself, who is confused by
the term blogroll.

And because I may use Widgets, and someone else uses Links, makes me less a
WP citizen?

I personally am not proposing a new tab, just a hook in capabilities to
separate theme editing from widgets....

Also, I'm of the opinion that changing widgets is in the same "trust circle"

What was the core decision of adding widgets?  Least common denominator
user?  Certainly couldn't have been about who could switch themes?

Switching themes is a different capability than editing themes.  Managing
widgets is tied to editing themes.  As I mentioned, I can currently make a
theme directory non-writable, thus suffer no consequence, likewise, if
widget management was tied to theme switching, I could remove all other
themes, but it still seems as if it's no longer theme/plugin related.

The root of the conversation, IMO, is that the powers that be made widgets a
core element.  Why is it a theme related element now?  Reality sake, it
should have never been under themes in the first place.  It was a plugin.
 But, that's another argument for another day, that I see being discussed?
Where do plugin options really belong.  As I'm saying, widgets are no longer
a plugin, and not about theme editing.  Why be relegated to that capability?


~miklb

Finally, my point is not to make them a top level tab/element, or even
really am I saying that they *must* be moved.  I'm just asking that a
separate capability hook be coded in so that they can be better leveraged.
 I'm assuming the reason they were incorporated into core was for this exact
reason.

Otherwise, there's still some pissing match going on between the pure PHP
folks and the user friendly ones.

Yes. And I'm aware of the forums, but this is a good place to vent this as
an issue that might need investigation.

FWIW, we use PHP widgets extensively and they work fine in 2.2.1 (after fixes that went into 2.2 after widgets were integrated into the core).

Hi Chris,

I am sure they will be happy for your contribution! I would sign up for
http://lists.bbpress.org/mailman/listinfo/bbdev
and I imagine lots of their discussions happen on http://bbpress.org/forums/

Well put.  "Links" is short and to the point,  unambiguous.  
"Bookmarks" sounds like a feature  that's somehow integrated with the  
browser, or aware of the author's personal collection of URLs. I  
would have to explain the concept of "Bookmarks" to clients almost as  
much as I have to explain the current "Blogroll." "Links" would  
require little or no explanation. It is what it says it is.  I don't  
get the appeal of "Bookmarks" at all. Why create needless confusion?

Nicely put, indeed.  I'd second this.

A link is a link.  No matter if it is in the text of the post or on
the sidebar or in the footer.  It's still just a link.

Actually I meant some form of integration with post writing.  I know
that I am not the only guy posting code snippets to my WordPress.com
blog.  Right now having properly formatted code snippets in the post
is so hard, that I had to fall back on editor screenshots (yuck!). :)

Otherwise, brackets are escaped, quotes converted to magic quotes,
indentation is lost, color highlighting is missing, and plain text
attachments are not allowed.  Or am I missing something?

P.S.: I am not sure that this list is the right way to discuss it, and
if it is not than where should I go?

Still in the Links camp am I, and I have to agree with Scot, Leonid and
Charles. You don't put bookmarks on a website to take you to other people's
websites. You put them in  your browser to take you back to places you've
been. Links might be the LCD of all our options, but the term is  the most
logical to the most people. And frankly as designers and developers, we
design and develop for LCD users. If they knew what they were doing, why
would they hire us?

As for the confusion over links in posts or links in the sidebar (and
repeated questions in the forums), won't that still exist with Bookmarks?
The forum is the place to ask and answer the same questions over and over
and over, ad nauseum....what else is new? Calling the Blogroll "Bookmarks"
won't clarify anything for the terminally confused or the newbies....they
will think they are making bookmarks that somehow get magically ported to
their browser...or someone else's browser....or into their wordprocessing
program....who knows....and come to the forum wondering why they aren't
showing up wherever they expect them! As long as WP is so easy to use, we
will deal with noobs and just plain yahoos. We were all noobs once too,
remember? (But never yahoos. ;-))

All the arguments for bookmarks are almost persuasive, but ultimately Links
is still my leaning. :)

Marci :)

I would not kill myself (or anybody else) if it is called Links in the
end -- yet I do believe that the Links in WordPress are much more than
just hrefs: They are structured in categories, they have a description
and XFN metadata. When you have your Links/Bookmarks on a single page or
in the sidebar, it is almost like the Favorites/Bookmarks in a browser.
Ok, you place them not for yourself, but for others, but I think that's
not so important. This concept of structured and enriched Links makes
WordPress unique in a certain way, and I think there's nothing wrong in
emphasizing this (yes, also and especially for newbies).

Drupal uses the jquery date picker module:

Since we'll be using jquery everywhere,  a jquery based date picker sounds nice.

"* the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to
the complexity of the change."

*Love it. Thanks for sharing the "bikeshed" link, Jeremy. I had never heard
that before, and it is very apropos.

I too will be fine with whatever the outcome is. I only asked out of mild
curiosity in the first place, and had no idea there would be (or already had
been) so much "noise" generated about it. I have found the discussion
enjoyable and enlightening, regardless, thanks in great part to the
"good-natured-ness" of the participants. It's been great to hear the
different sides of the issue and I feel more educated now. And who
knows....maybe the end result will prompt me to write my first plugin: to
change the tab names to what I want. ;-)

I don't know if you meant it as a joke, but one of the first messages
in the thread mentions Custom Admin Menu plugin, which does exactly
that. LOL. :)

I, on the other hand, will not be fine with it. And if it ends up
being called "Links" I will most certainly avoid the Wordpress support
forums, as I do not relish having to wade through hundreds of more
threads full of user confusion.

If you ever patched the ExecPHP widget to make it work with 2.2, then
you need to undo that patch. Get the original, unaltered, ExecPHP
widget. It works fine with 2.2.1.

The original bug required a patch to Wordpress, not to the widget.
Those people that patched the widget will have issues.

OH I know....and I tried it, but it didn't work for me in 2.1.3. I responded
to the suggestion earlier in this thread too, saying that it didn't work for
me, and I haven't got time right now to mess with it in any depth. Maybe I
will come back to it later. The comments on this plugin mentioned a LOT of
problems, and the plugin author doesn't seem to be responding to them. Not
to mention....I couldn't figure out how to actually CHANGE the names of the
tabs, only hide them or change their location. So....it may be a project for
another day. And my plugin (if I ever actually did it...it was a
half-joke...) would be pretty simple -- name changes only, not the extent of
what this Custom Admin plugin is meant to do. I don't think I have the
php/ajax skills for anything near as complex as what this developer did!

Thanks for mentioning it, though. :)

Marci :)

"Bookmarks" it is, since nobody else seems to be making threats about it.

Maybe if we spell it "Links", but pronouce it "Throat-Warbler-Mangrove"?

I really hate to feed the troll(s), but by this logic, should we also
replace the [ link ] button in the plain-text post editor?

Exactly. Which is what the "Blogroll" is. A collection of links. Sorry

Actually, there's a legitimate point there.  If I want to find  
information on WordPress, I can go to Google and search for  
"wordpress" and get items related to what I want.

Have you ever tried to Google-search help for Microsoft "Word"?   
There's a Mac program called "Books" with a similar problem -- not to  
mention "Pages".

Yes, "bookmarks" is a widely used term already, but in the context of  
Wordpress -- it means something in particular....

If a year from now I go to the codex and search for help on "links"  
I'm going to inevitably get a ton of stuff that is completely  
unrelated to what I need -- because we'll have two different things  
with the same name.  Thus, there's an argument for "bookmarks" simply  
because it's a _different_ term used for a _different_ thing.

BTW -- I looked back over this thread, and my earlier email reads a  
lot snarkier than intended.  It was meant in good humor.  :)

A few have suggested this, but nothing really came of it, so I'm opening

I think the best thing to do is to do some kind of informal survey on how
Joe user would take to either title.  Putting WP through a ole-fashioned
usability test would solve this question for us.

I thought sandbox was proposed to be bundled with the 2.3 release already?
Don't quote me on that though, I could be wrong.

Subject: [wp-hackers] OpenID vs wp-comments-post.php
Message-ID: <61555.213.118.46.26.1182607617.squirrel@www.netsensei.nl>

Hello,

Recently I created a wordpress plugin for WP2.1: simple OpenID plugin.
What it does is act as a simple OpenID consumer for commenters using their
OpenID instead of entering their nickname or using a local WP account.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-openid-plugin

I got a beta released in May... it seemed to work with a little effort on
WP 2.1 but WP 2.2 seems to be a no go.

Description of the problem:

Whenever a commenter wishes to use his OpenID login, he/she gets a blank
page on wp-comments-post.php.

Context:

The OpenID protocol notes that consumer should redirect the user's user
agent (browser) to their respective OpenID provide (i.e. myopenid.com) for
authentication. The OpenID provider redirects them back to the consumer
script  they came from with a positive/negative authentication answer and
some additional data. Based upon the answer, the script can react
accordingly: logging in or - in this case - allowing a comment to be saved
in the WP database.

Cause:

In 2.2 wp-comments-post.php doesn't allow GET requests anymore which
results in a blank page due to a security patch.

- http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-February/010722.html
- http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3797

The problem is that my OpenID plugin hooks on wp-comments-post.php. It
redirects the users to their OpenID provider. The provider then sends them
back to wp-comments-post.php with a GET request. Finally, the plugin gets
the user data from GET request and uses it to complete the comment before
storing it in the WP database.

So. There you have it. I acknowledge that using GET requests directly on
wp-comments-post.php is an open inivitation for spammers, but it closes a
lot of opportunities. I could hack around using some other script and the
'init' action hook in order to get GET requests to accepted, but that's
not really a good solution. Conversion of GET to POST before feeding to
wp-comments-post.php isn't a great solution either.

I wonder if someone has a good idea to get this working properly.

Oh, an unrelated problem: under WP 2.1, OpenID enabled comments posted
through my plugin where send to the spambin by askimet nonetheless.

Thanks in advance,

Matthias Vandermaesen

I don't think that's true. A "sandbox" branch was created in the SVN
(/branches/sandbox) but nothing ever came of it, that I know of.

I myself don't use all that. But hey, can't I stand up for gay rights,
even though I'm straight? ;-)

Seriously, I myself am not what you would call a blogger. But I do work
very much (almost exclusively) with WordPress, and I provide support at
the German WP forums. So I believe to know how people work with this
software. They would undoubtedly be perfectly happy with "Links", yet
"Bookmarks" would emphasize the extra features.

But I agree with Jeremy -- this is a bikeshed discussion, and this is my
last answer to this thread.

Best,
Alex

IIRC, that "sandbox" has nothing to do with "sandbox" the theme.  It  
was intended as an "anything goes" playground for WP  
experimentation.  I think that was before the new release cycle,  
which sort of has its own built-in "anything goes" period.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Admin Action Prior to Headers
Message-ID: <467DC100.50206@copperleaf.org>

I'm working on a plugin that I want to store data in a session when in 
the admin area. In order to do this, I need to call session_start before 
any header data has been sent. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a way 
to do this just for admin pages and not impact standard pages. In other 
words, I'd rather not call session_start with the init or plugins_loaded 
actions. Looking through the docs and the source, I couldn't find 
another way to do it. Any thoughts? If I have to do it with init or 
plugins_loaded, is there a clean way to identify that it's an admin page 
being loaded? Would it be worth adding an admin action just before 
nocache_headers but after auth_redirect?

Thx,
Bill

How about checking the value of is_admin()?

Message-ID: <B327F9A8-92F8-440D-8414-A893615947B9@birdhouse.org>

A question for those of you who have written shell (or other) scripts  
to perform mass upgrades of client WP installations: Do your scripts  
also attempt to trigger wp-admin/upgrade.php after updating, or do  
you generate an email telling the user to do that (with link)?

If upgrade.php isn't run soon after the file upgrade is completed, is  
there any danger of the public site not displaying correctly?

Also, a policy question: Do you let clients opt-in to having their  
blogs automatically upgraded when new releases come out, or do you  
simply upgrade all client installations automatically for security  
reasons?

Thanks,
Scot

In-Reply-To: <B327F9A8-92F8-440D-8414-A893615947B9@birdhouse.org>

There's only two people who have publicly disclosed mass upgrade  
methods (that I'm aware of) and both are employed by b5, so I guess  
I'll field this question. ;) A third who does this, I can only  
assume, is Automattic with WordPress.com - but I can't speak for them.

Our upgrade script does indeed invoke cURL to run the upgrade.php  
script. We can't expect our bloggers to do anything except freak out  
when they see the "Database requires upgrade" message. :) Most of the  
time, if a blog slips through it's no big deal. The blog will display  
publicly as expected. One of the recent upgrades (2.0 -> 2.1) did  
indeed break the Loop until upgrade though, but most of the time that  
doesn't happen and the blog will continue to operate as normal. In  
fact, that's the only time it has ever happened in my recollection.

As for the policy question - understand that in our case, we own 95%  
of the blogs with a few exceptions where blogger-owned blogs  
affiliate with us for business reasons. In those rare cases, it is  
understood contractually that we handle the tech including upgrades.  
So no, we don't allow people to opt in or opt out. It doesn't fit our  
philosophy as a company to have people doing different things.

Hope that helps.

Yeah, well, unless anybody opens a Trac ticket, the idea's just going to

Message-ID: <b76f24970706240814w3b3cbfefsc0bdd76226f9ded4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All.

If I comment out the call to the_editor() function in
wp-admin/edit-form-advanced.php, then the post body text area
disappears.  That is something I wanted and expected.

But something else happens - all other boxes on the page (categories,
discussion, post password, trackbacks, custom fields, etc) expand.
And now they also miss that +/- thingy which one uses to collapse
them.

Is this a bug or something?  Why is this happenning?  What should I do
bring the collap/expand functionality back?

I looked through the the_editor() function definition in
wp-includes/general-template.php , but couldn't spot the reason for
this behavior.

I've tried this on a fresh install of WordPress 2.2.1 .

TIA.

is_admin(), but take a note that this doesn't return true for wp-login.php,

Ah, my bad. I always thought, for some reason, that that had something to do

If your wanting to see if the person is an admin then do the is_admin() like other's have suggested. If you are wanting to see if the page being served is from the admin section, then you could always check the request url, something like:


if (strstr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],"/wp-admin/")) {
	[....do the admin section only stuff here...]
}

Incorrect. is_admin means that you are on a page within wp-admin not
that you are the admin user.

This check just repeats what is_admin already does.

This is caused by all javascript processing stopping when it reaches
line 6 in autosave.js:

Error: form.content has no properties
Source File: /wp-includes/js/autosave.js?ver=20070306
Line: 6

This means that none of the other javascript gets processed - so the dbx
boxes don't get there behaviour

Message-ID: <b76f24970706241102u3303e4b0w1632c12a39db8174@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All.

I am trying to add languages tabs ('English', 'German', 'Russian',
etc) to the post form.

I see that so much stuff is setup around post_title being a post_title
and content being content that there is no way I could easily change
those to anything else.  So, the usual CSS/JavaScript approach, where
I would have post_title_en and content_en for English, and
post_title_ru and content_ru for Russian, fails miserably.  It's just
not worth the effort.

My current approach is to have the tabs with onClick events.  I want
to use post_title and content as aggregates.  I found this plugin
Language Switcher:

http://poplarware.com/languageplugin.html

It basically does everything I want, minus the user interface.  It
uses markup like <lang_en>some text</lang_en><lang_ru>some
text</lang_ru>, which can be easily applied for both post_title and
content.

So, the thing that I am trying to do is to have one form with content
and post_title with a number of language tabs nearby.  When a language
tab is clicked, the values from content and post_title are saved into
JavaScript variable or maybe even a cookie, and the values for the new
selected language are loaded back from variables.  When the post is
saved, values should be aggregated and saved in the post_title and
post_content DB fields.

Is it something that could work?  Is there any better approach?

P.S.: For tab management I use Tabber script from here:
http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/ .

Yeah, I noticed that :) Based on that experience, I've built in a  
simple wget call to

wp-admin/upgrade.php?step=1&backto=

which seems to complete the job nicely. On reflection, it would be  
pretty lame to not have the script finish the  upgrade, so this is  
definitely the way to go.

Gotcha. I decided to slate all user blogs for automated update, but  
have sent a message to customers giving them the opportunity to opt  
out of the program. Won't run the script on production blogs until  
they've had a chance to opt out. I guess the biggest danger here is  
the rare user who has (probably unnecessarily) modified core files -  
that's where a system like this could really break things, forcing me  
to go to backups, etc.

Thanks,
Scot

Hello,

I was wanting to use wp_list_pages() (or maybe there's a better function for
the job) to display the 10 latest pages. But, looking at the documentation,
it appears that there is no way to limit the amount of pages to list. Should
there not be a way to limit the amount of pages to be listed?

Thanks,

wp_list_pages() is a wrapper function around get_pages().  get_pages()
provides better control of what you and how you get.   Check how it's
defined in wp-includes/post.php .

Well, it has get_pages filter, which could be used to get rid of
excessive pages.  The other thing, of course, is that this filter runs
AFTER the query has been executed. But then again, there is some form
of cache too...

Just created this Ticket and Patch.
Patch is based around the get_posts implementation, If a non-negitive  
number of pages is given then it'll do the limiting. Default remains as  
returning all pages.

Sometimes. It depends on the upgrade.

I warn customers first but unless I hear otherwise, they get upgraded

Thanks. That should probably be added to wp_list_pages(), too.

I took a glance at that, But decided to add it just to get_pages since any  
parameters passed to wp_list_pages() are passed along to get_pages()  
anyway.
This way anything else that calls get_pages() can utilise it as well.

hello all,
we are going to draw next days a proposal for a client, a sort of  
bookshop, and we are looking to build this system on wordpress.
just we can't find much about integration between wordpress and any  
opensource e-commerce module.

we actually don't want to deal with online payments or something  
alike, and we just want a sort of 'cart' to organize orders, and deal  
with it by email.
we are experimenting with oscommerce and zencart, but are both too  
heavy for us.

do some of you have ever built a solution like this, or do you know  
something useful? I would really appreciate your help.

thank you for your time
p.

Message-ID: <467FBB5D.1000809@yadan.net>

I just saw that my server time zone is off by one hour, probably because 
of DST.

so I changed the offset value in the admin page, refreshed the post page 
and nothing changed.

I am guessing that the reason for that is that the absolute time is 
calculated when the comment is submitted, and stored as such.

I suggest that we store UTC timestamp everywhere, and convert them 
before they are displayed.

Not everyone has a constant offset from their server's time.

Your suggestion would retrospectively change the displayed times of
posts which were correct at the time the post was made.

If the times your posts are incorrect, the fix is to alter the times of
the posts.

people with changing time offset have bigger problems than this.

if the time of the posts is in UTC, its always correct.
keeping the time as UTC will also allow showing different time to 
different users, based on their time zone. (assuming some way for the 
users to specify their time zones).

The time in UTC will be correct but people don't display the date of
their posts in UTC. Here's an example of what might go wrong with your
proposal.

- It's 17:00 UTC, local time is an hour in advance of that, 18:00. The
offset is +1.
- They make a post. The blog claims the post was made at 18:00.
- local time gets set back an hour that night, the admin changes the
offset to 0.
- The post is displayed, WordPress calculates the time it was made by
adding the offset to the UTC time and displays 17:00 localtime. This is
incorrect, the post was made at 18:00 localtime!

HTH,

James

WordPress stores the date values for comments and posts as both local
time and GMT time.

In every case, all you have to do to display times as offset from GMT
instead of local time--which would seem to address the issue you
mention--is to filter whatever time or date function you're using in
your theme templates.

In some cases, such as for the get_comment_time and get_post_time
functions, it's even simpler: you can pass to a function an optional
argument that allows you to specify whether or not you want GMT time.
For example, get_post_time('U') returns the post's local time;
get_post_time('U', true) returns it as GMT.

There is a very decent ecommerce plugin for WP here:

http://www.instinct.co.nz/e-commerce

They have a free and paid version. I have used the free version and it
worked well, other than a glitch with another plugin (but that is the fault
of the other plugin, which is known to be shaky).

That said, I don't know how you can not deal with online payments, once you
have a cart. But this one does have an option for manual payments.....if
that helps. Not manual payments alone, but manual payments as an option
alongside Paypal.

You will do a LOT better with online sales if you use Paypal or some sort of
payment processing online. Most people won't bother dealing with manual
payments of any sort -- they are too cumbersome. I know some folks refuse to
buy online too, for all kinds of security fears, but they are the minority.
The above cart is designed to work with Paypal in the free version.

HTH :)

Ehehehe.

Unfortunately (for me, not for you) you don't know what a pain is  
making web apps in Italy today.

We - as freelances - have to deal with clients that refuses to  
upgrade their IE5, that don't use internet at all for their work, in  
some previous cases they didn't even have a computer.
And better: they are ready to pay huge money for obsolete services,  
but they don't want pay a buck for internet at all (sort of "but

Sorry, but web development here is another planet. So we have to deal

Right now, my Firefox "bookmarks" show the favicon images of whatever
they point to. They are organized into categories and folders. Many of
them are Live Bookmarks, and so they update themselves from RSS feeds.
Some of them (notably woot.com and my own site) even use
microsummaries, which allows them to change the text/wording of the
bookmark whenever the site publishes a new text for that bookmark.

So yeah, I'd say they're more than a "link" would be.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Creating an options sub-submenu
Message-ID: <467FE758.4090205@elektroelch.de>

Hi,

I'm writing a plugin which has many, many options. To put all these 
options onto a single page would result in a confusingly complex 
interface. So I have the idea to split the options into various sub-pages:

Options
|
|-- myPluginOptions
   |
   |-- General Options
   |-- Advanced Options
   |-- Gallery
   |-- ...
   |-- About

Sparma Karma 2, for example, does have such subpages (General Settings, 
Recent Spam Harvest, ...) in its options menu but it look quite like an 
"unofficial" solution.

Does Wordpress have a built-in mechanism to create such subpages in the 
options menu pages? If not, is there any "semi official" solution to 
this problem or do I have to look for a CSS tabbed menu of my choice and 
try to fit it into the layout?

If there is no mechanism to create sub-subpages how's the idea to 
include such a thing into Wordpress? I think plugins became more and 
more complex over the time and some option pages really look totally 
cluttered. An option to divide such pages into "Basic", "Advanced", 
"Geek", ... would be a step towards user friendliness, wouldn't it?

Shows off one more way in which the OpenID protocol is fundamentally
broken, IMO. The fact that the OpenID Server has to redirect the user
back and thus use a GET is a fundamentally flawed way of doing things.
GETs must be idempotent, and posting a comment or anything along those
lines is not idempotent.

Still, consider using a different redirection page. Instead of
redirecting them back to wp-comments-post.php, redirect them to
another page which will get their login information (like their email
address) from the OpenID request and such and then fill in a form for
them to submit directly. It adds another step to the process, but then
that's what OpenID does: makes things more complicated.

Calculating the offset on the fly would allow offset changes to  
invalidate the dates of previous comments and posts.  Even worse, it  
would break the permalinks of some posts.  Say you posted something  
at 0205 GMT with -03 offset.  So 11:05pm "yesterday."  If you change  
the offset to -02, now the post is at 12:05am "today"  Now the  
permalink URL changes.

We store the GMT date and the local date, which is calculated as GMT  
+ offset at the time the post was published.  This is the same as us  
storing GMT + offset per post.  Either way it is two fields, and this  
way involves less processing.

Sorry, it wasn't meant to be a "threat", I was just saying that I
don't like how complicated providing support will be if we were to
call two different things by the same name. Bookmarks are not links.
Links are in posts. Bookmarks are not and are more than just a-href's.

No, because that actually *does* add Links. Which are not Bookmarks. See?

I see .. sorry, Lutz. I was too fascinated by the ASCII art, and for
some reason thought that "Options" stands for the entire menu bar. :-/

However, afaik there is no official way for this. But you might try to
create sub-sub-menus e.g. by creating one and controling the actual
output via a GET parameter.

As the page itself already is actually a GET parameter for admin.php (or
the respective menu item), you would have to mask the parameter and
parse the entire request URI to get your parameter. Or, you could insert
a form with buttons and send the parameter via POST.

No worries, I just meant "threat" in the "take my toys and go home" way, and
not anything more insidious.

This is where I just have to bite my pinky finger and stop.  I can't imagine
the world where links exists only in posts, and where they can't have

It's actually fairly straightforward to do this, and WP does have the 
mechanism built in. You simply use add_menu_page to add the top-level 
menu, and then add_submenu_page to add submenus to it. Function args 
are described in:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus

Here's an example:

// top-level menu -- note that
add_menu_page( 'Main Menu Title', 'Main Menu Title', 
'required_capability_or_role', 'plugin_file.php, 'main_menu_function' );

   // sub-menus

add_submenu_page( 'plugin_file.php', 'Submenu Title 1',
'Submenu Title 1', 'required_capability', 'plugin_file.php', 
'submenu_1_function' );

// etc.

Or just pass an extra parameter; the submenu is passed as "page", so the 
logical choice would probably be "subpage".

So, add an options submenu, and then in your code do something like:

switch ( $_GET['subpage'] ) {
    case 'foo':
        // display "foo" sub-sub-menu
        break;
    case 'bar':
        // display "bar" sub-sub-menu
        break;
}

Which will allow you to use options.php?page=your-plugin&subpage=foo to 
display the "foo" sub-sub-menu, options.php?page=your-plugin&subpage=bar 
to display the "bar" sub-sub-menu, etc.

But to address the original question: no, there's no official way to do 
this. Either create your own sub-sub-menu as above, or just create a new 
menu item--whichever's more logical and intuitive.

The correct solution to the problem you described is to work with time
zones and not time offsets, and consider the timezone DST.

for time zones that have DST but does not have constant DST dates the
user should be able to specify those days.

Well, I did read the page, but it didn't enlighten me :-(. At least I'm 
now quite sure which function I have to use (and that there is one) and 
can search the Net for some example since the doc is a bit too abstract 
for my taste.

Nevertheless, thanks for the pointer!

Because DST (or other time-shifting scheme) start/end dates *aren't*  
constant, it doesn't make sense to have timezones coded into  
WordPress.  That'd be a big maintenance burden.

Allowing the user to specify start/end dates (and new offset within  
that range) is a possible solution, but it's pretty geeky.  Plugins  
can solve this issue, which moves the maintenance burden off of  
WordPress core and doesn't present needless options to people who  
don't live in a timezone-shifting area of the world.  Plugins can  
also be updated more frequently than WordPress, so when politicians  
change the dates or start/stop timezone shifting, the people using  
the plugin can just update.

I did a little research, because all this talk of bookmarks being a better
term than links just hasn't seemed logical to me, but I wasn't sure why.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmark_%28computers%29
Tells me that computer bookmarks (as opposed to paper bookmarks :)) are URLs
stored for easy access later (in a browser or online document), and social
bookmarks are the same thing, but public. This does not begin to describe
what we can do with the links/bookmarks/blogroll in WP.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink
Explains hyperlinks, or links for short, and their ability to help the user
navigate the web. This precisely defines the core of what we have in WP:
links around the web, with all their useful attributes.

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html
Tells me that "links" is the common name for HTML anchors, and that they are
indeed links, no matter how many attributes they may have (title, rel, img,
XFN, etc).  Links are capable of much more than hrefs, but calling them
bookmarks seems insufficient, since bookmarks (at least the ones I've seen
so far) only do a handful of the things links can do.

Bookmarks are URLs stored in your browser or on a social bookmarking site.

Links are dynamic entities that take you from one web page to another, or
help you navigate around a page or a site.

Everyone can use and display their links in whatever way they want (as
bookmarks, social or private, just plain hrefs, XFN, images) But they are
hyperlinks at their very core, and IMHO renaming them bookmarks will lead to
more confusion, not less.

The term links may be as old as the web, but that is an advantage. Seems to
me that a platform as universal as WP should use terminology as universal as
"links".

Calling them Links affords an opportunity for newbies to LEARN all that
links are capable of (when they click the "Links" tab and discover all these
extra settings they didn't expect), and then be able to transfer that
knowledge to other situations.

If we call them Links on the admin tab, I think MOST users, even the total
newbies, will KNOW intuitively what they are for, because everyone knows
what a link is. There will be fewer support requests, not more.

Bottom line: I'm not seeing Bookmarks as the correct term for what we have
in WP. That they aren't "just plain hrefs" I definitely agree -- but denying
they are "links" denies all that links have evolved into, and elevates
bookmarks to a status they haven't really earned. I think it also creates
unnecessary end-user confusion, and more frustration for newbies trying to
learn WP.

That's my $.02. I will now go sit in the bikeshed.

Well said! Not to mention that if the user sees that they're called
Bookmarks, they might relate them to Bookmarks in their Browser and might
think that when they add a new "Bookmark" in WP, it'll be added to their
browser and the visitor's browser. Or, they might think that when they add a
Bookmark in their Browser, that it'll be added to WP too. Which would
defiantly create some confusion and stupid support requests.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP and Plugins DB connection conflicts
Message-ID: <FBD32E02-162E-486D-A029-E93123713680@oncefuture.com>

I've been seeing some odd database connection conflicts between  
various plugin combinations and have narrowed the issue down to the  
fact that WP does not force a new database link to be created when it  
initiates its connection in wp-db.php. this is a problem if a plugin  
creates it's own db connection with the same user credentials as  
those used by WP and then closes the connection or produces errors on  
the link.

Currently:

$this->dbh = @mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpassword);

Propose:

$this->dbh = @mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpassword, true);

The bool at the end of the connection will force a new link to be  
created instead of piggybacking on an existing connection.

Thoughts?

Hi,

it would be nice to have a global option to disable comments and
pingbacks for pages.  Currently it's either pages AND posts, or on an
individual level.

The common case scenario that I see is that pages are used for About
Us and Contact Us kind of pages, which don't need either comments or
pingbacks.  Posts are used for everything else, and feedback is just
fine there.

Have someone maybe saw a plugin which allows a control like this?

Don't forget all this option does is set the default for these options for
new posts/pages that are created - it does not change the settings for
past posts.

These can easily be changed when you create the page.

Adding extra options for every type of content object seems to me to be a
case of over engineering the number of options,

Indeed, plus the fact that it would be trivial to write a plugin to 
achieve this (when a post is saved, check if it's a page and if so 
disable comments and trackbacks for it).

Yes, and that's what I think is needed.  The default.

Yes, but when WordPress installation is given to a client, than this
extra bit of training needs to be done.  Then, they forget sometimes
and start asking questions about pingbacks which were sent by their
own web site and things like that.

I'm not asking for an option for every type of object.  But I think
that since WP differentiates between pages and posts, then it makes
sense.

That's not the goal.  The user should still have the control of
whether he wants to have pings/comments enabled for each particular
post or not.  It's the matter of the default.  If it's a page
(something time-less, often forever, and often rarely changed) than
can we please have no comments or pings unless we specifically want
so.   If it's a post (something current, something very time related)
than sure, why not have pings/comments from others who care about this
type of thing right now.


Here is an example to illustrate better.  A WP-based web site for a
company which publishes news about itself, has some static information
(like About Us), and has a product or service catalogue.  Now, they
have comments/pings for their news section (posts). They don't want to
have pings/comments for their products section in general, but a few
exceptions, when they want to learn who is writing about their new
product/service.

Like this, they'd allow comments/pings for posts.  Switch off the
default for pages, and only use it occasionally.

I believe the usual thing for a plugin is to use $wpdb to do database 
queries, rather than creating its own database connections. Is there 
some reason these plugins cannot be rewritten to do that? It might 
mean adding a require() line somewhere, to make sure $wpdb has been 
initialized, but then there would be no conflict.

I think the issue arrises when a Plugin wants to access a seperate  
database than Wordpress's.
I saw a Trac ticket which refered to something similar earlier actually:
http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2722
the solution in the Ticket description isnt the best though.

Marci: I read your links, and I disagree with your conclusions. Those
links support my position better than they do yours. :)

The link you provided to describe bookmarks has that information about
social bookmarks. These describe Wordpress's blogroll/bookmarks
functionality to the last detail. They are URL's which are stored for
easy access later, they are shared (you post them on your page), and
if you specifically look at this page which describes social
bookmarking:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking
You'll find that social bookmarks are often categorized or tagged into
a folksonomy. It also describes how bookmarks often allow for more
than that, such as users rating them and such. While those specific
features are not currently in Wordpress, the point is that the social
bookmark is more than just a URL.

Contrarily, your page on hyperlinks does not describe Wordpress's
blogroll/bookmarks at all. You are correct that they are hyperlinks,
however you're looking only at the end product, not the process. All
a-href's are hyperlinks.

> bookmarks seems insufficient, since bookmarks (at least the ones I've seen
> so far) only do a handful of the things links can do.

Bookmarks can *always* do more than a simple link can. Here's a simple link:
<a href="http://example.com">Link</a>

But that's just the END RESULT of what Bookmarks do. I want Wordpress
Bookmarks to have tags. I want them to be displayable in a dozen
different ways. I want them to have the functionality and the features
and the capabilities of "social bookmarks". That's the point here.
They have some of that functionality already. Relegating them back to
simple "links" is doing a disservice to Wordpress and a disservice to
the Wordpress user community.

Advance. Not retreat.

Demonstrably false. Look at the actual forum. Look at the history.
Mainly, look at the pre-2.1 requests. The confusion level went way
down just from changing it to "Blogroll". Okay, so there was a small
contingent that didn't like the change, but then there's always people
that don't like change.

All links have not evolved. A link in a post has no metadata on the
backend. It's just a link. It doesn't have the capability of being
sorted by the last updated time, for example. It cannot point out an
RSS feed to a site as well as pointing to the site itself.

A Bookmark is a link *with supporting backend code*. It's not just an
a-href with rel tags and such.

On the contrary, it creates less user confusion (as you'd *see* if you
bothered to actually *look* at the history in the support forums), and
it makes it easier to associate the section with other services.
Bookmarks are similar to other social bookmarking services, like
del.icio.us. I'd like to see them become even more similar. I'd like
them to get more features and functionality.

If all you want to add is a link to your sidebar, use a Text widget
and HTML code. Why have the bookmarks section at all if you just want
that much functionality?

I'll give you another example:

On my own site, I don't have a lot of entries in the Blogroll. On the
left sidebar of my page, there's the Blogroll section. One thing you
may notice, if you look closely enough or often enough, is that the
entries there will reorder themselves. That's because I have a script
reading the RSS feeds of each entry in my Bookmarks, and updating the
"last update time" for the bookmarks. They are then displayed in order
by that last updated time. So the blogs with the most recent entries
will always be at the top of the list. Neat, huh?

Can "links" reorder themselves?

In this case, the person who posted to the list said he was logging in 
with the same credentials as WP, though. Most plugins (I think) use 
the WP db, since some users on shared hosts will not have permission 
to create new DBs, and anyway people probably want all their 
WP-related data in the same database.  The Trac post was in regards to 
using a db on a completely different host.

If you want to access a different database entirely, you shouldn't use
the $wpdb functions at all, IMO. Do your own mysql_connect and such,
and you won't have any conflicts. And if you do want to access the
wordpress database, use $wpdb. Seems simple enough.

I think a lot of this problem is plugin-author-error as opposed to an
issue with Wordpress.

More to the point, it seems like an extremely bad idea to modify the
$wpdb to be forced to open a new link every time. It would add a lot
of overhead that might not always be absolutely necessary.

This really has gone on a lot longer than it should, as it's already
been called a bikeshed. However, I've yet to hear of anyone being
confused by the term "Links" in WP and if I'm not mistaken, it's been
"Links" since the pre-0.7.2 days. A quick glance at several of the
demos at opensourcecms.com shows that Link(s) what the majority of
popular blog and CMS packages use to refer to this functionality.

This needs to end though - can we get a dev to speak up and let us
know if it's something even worth debating?

As of php 5.1 and up, all that stuff is built in:
http://php.net/manual/en/function.date-default-timezone-set.php

It seems to me that the best way would be to allow the user to enter a
timezone string directly, and then to act accordingly. Some of this
work has already been done here:
http://drakecms.sourceforge.net/index.php?option=content&id=32&Itemid=10
http://drakecms.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/drakecms/trunk/includes/i18n/

Putting it all in a plugin makes sense, but there needs to be some way
for a plugin to override the timezone functionality throughout
Wordpress. Can that be easily done?

This can be done in a Theme and a custom field.  Check out the  
Sandbox Theme with the "Spartan" setting.  I found this out by  
surprise when I stopped getting comments on a popular page!

Without looking at that theme, what's the purpose of the custom field?  Why
not just remove the call to the comment form in the default page template
and be done with it?  You could always create a Page template that has the
comment form if you knew there'd be Pages that need comments enabled.

The custom field allows you to turn comments ON for a particular  
page.  Basically the page.php code has a bit in there that says, if  
CustomFieldX is present, show the comments form.

So... by default, no comments on pages.  If you want comments on a  
particular page, add the custom field to that page.

I use it -- my WordPress plugin is on a page (less transient than a  
blog post), and gets comments.  Other pages don't need comments, and  
don't have them.

Here's the code:

<?php if ( get_post_custom_values('comments') ) comments_template 
() // Add a key+value of "comments" to enable comments on this page ?>

I have a bit of feedback on anti-spam plugins in general: recently I 
had a client that needed (for various reasons) to have some users 
register on their WP-based site, and they wanted to avoid spam 
registrations.

For others in the same situation, it would be useful if the 
anti-comment-spam plugins would add their anti-spam filtering to 
WordPress's registration mechanism, for those who have registration 
turned on in their options.

Rather than interminable discussions on semantics, how about we reach  
out to users on this one and get some real feedback. I'm thinking  
that if a few of us posted Democracy polls on our blogs (to get a  
wide range of samples) and one of us posted a discussion thread in  
the support forums briefly describing the debate and asking which  
nomenclature seemed most *intuitive*, we might get some useful  
numbers and user feedback. You know, like actual market research?

Calling it a bikeshed issue doesn't actually make it one. And I'll go
further to say that this is not actually a bikeshed issue. What is at
issue here is the larger concept of what, exactly, the "blogroll"
functionality is supposed to do and/or be.

I'm betting that a lot of people advocating "links" here don't
actually use the blogroll for a whole lot, right? Anybody care to
dispute that? Who here uses it for more than simply an easy way to add
links into their sidebar?

What I would like the Bookmarks to become is more than that. I want:
-Tagging and categorizing
-Full category integration with Posts and Bookmarks (they share
categories and all categories show up in all places)
-Rating (still in the database, but the user interface has been removed)
-The ability to integrate Bookmarks I post into the Loop by adding
timestamps to them when they are added/posted and pulling those in as
well... including into RSS feeds
-The equivalent of "Post by Email" for Bookmarks...
-Integration of Bookmarks with other social bookmarking services, like
del.icio.us and others... synchronize between them
-Yes, integration of Bookmarks with my browser.. This may mean nothing
more than an OPML list of my bookmarks, or it may mean adding an RSS
feed capability to them.

And so on. Again, if all you use it for is links in the sidebar, then
why have this functionality at all? There's nothing there that a Text
widget can't do.

How about actually making money with Links?  People sell Links on
their web sites.  Not bookmarks.  Not blogrolls.  And when they do so,
it doesn't matter where the link is added - in the post, on the
sidebar, or on the top of the page as a menu, or in the footer.  These
are all Links.

The issue with Web 2.0 in general and social bookmarks in particular
is that things are called names just for the sake of being called
names.  Normal people (those that don't work in IT industry) have hard
times keeping up with all the terminology.  And I think it makes sense
to make it easier on them, whether the application/service is a
flagmen or not.

Links is what those people know.  They send each other links in the
email.  They share interesting links.  They follow links on the web.
They sell and buy links.  They rate links. They arrange links on their
web site.

Even the most in-accurate benchmark of all - the Google number of
search results - suggests that Links it should be.

links: 1,750,000,000 results
bookmarks: 134,000,000 results

Now that's more than 10 times the difference. :)

P.S.: Social bookmarks are just the links that people share. And
organize. Together.

P.P.S.: Think of non-native English speakers too.  To make it easier
on you, which word looks better for you - ?????? or ????????? ;)

P.P.P.S.: This is the last message from me in this thread.  Respond
personally if you feel like continuing the conversation.

So, do you call everything you sit on a "chair", even if it's a couch?
Or a bed? Or the floor?

Names distinguish different types of things from each other. It could
be easier to call everything "Bob". That way, you always know what
everything is: it's "Bob".

Exactly my point. These are more than links. They have enough (or, at
least I certainly want them to have enough) distinguishing
characteristics to make them different than a mere URL which they send
around.

And while you and others may think that the name is the least part of
a thing, I disagree. Names do indeed matter. Words matter. Words
define how people think of things, how they conceive of them. Calling
them "Links" reduces them to something that people think they already
know. However, people don't already know this. This is something they
need to learn, it's something new, it's not the same old thing that
they have stuck in their mind as "links" and so yes, it needs a
different name.

Actually, this backs up my point, not yours. People already know what
a link is. And these are not links, therefore giving them that name
doesn't make any sense.

Correct. Which is what I want Wordpress bookmarks to be too. What part
of this is not getting through?

Doesn't make any difference to me, I'll leave the translation up to
the translators.

Sorry, but I feel that this is important enough to share with the
list, and I'll continue to keep it in the view of the list. Don't
respond if you don't want to do so.

seriously, *everything* is debateable: it's a question of coming to a  
conclusion.

Otto, you've made great efforts to make your point but I think few  
people are "buying it" (and I can appreciate it: I myself often get  
accused of arguing semantics!)

"the mechanism" in question allows for making lists of links. they  
can be bookmarks, they can be blogrolls, they can be links to just  
about anything. That fact alone trumps all arguments.

"the mechanism" in question allows the makign of "things you can sit  
on". they can be chairs, sofas, recliners... but int he end they are  
"things you sit on"... Links.

Epic discussion! bravo community! :)

Lads and Ladies --

Not sure how much my cute little opinion rates on this list -- but  
I'm with Otto all the way on this one.  I previously made a  
(sarcastic) proposal for changing "Posts" to "Words" because not  
everyone knows what a "post" is, but everyone knows what "words" are.

All snark aside, the point is there.  Yes, these things we're talking  
about _are_ links, just as Posts _are_ just bunches of words.  But  
"words" isn't specific enough -- a post is more than just words.   
"Links" isn't specific enough -- these things are more than a simple  
<A> tag.

"Bookmarks" is a word that in the context of the web has taken on two  
distinct, but related, meanings.  There are the "favorites" you set  
in your web browser, and there are the Digg-like "social" bookmarks  
that you find on web sites.  I think that most users will recognize  
the distinction that when working in the Options for their web site,  
they're talking about "bookmarks" on their web site, not on their  
browser's menu.  (That SOME people will get confused goes without  
saying, no matter what you do.)

We can argue semantics for ages (I say "links" are what hold my shirt  
cuffs together -- Aha!)... but ultimately it comes down to  
usefulness, not what we can find in a dictionary.  Links is a _very_  
broad term -- so broad in this case that they entirely fail to  
suggest the full potential capabilities of WordPress bookmarks.  A  
Post is more than just Words; and these are more than mere Links.

Short of coming up with some _entirely new_ never-before-heard word  
(on the basis that these aren't _precisely_ something covered by any  
pre-existing word) bookmarks is a tighter and more succinct term than  
the overly generic "links", without straying into the overly  
restrictive realm of terms like "blogroll".

Sincerely,

Stephen Rider

If I'm not mistaken, Otto, and please correct me if I'm wrong, you're
advocating the addition of WP features to turn plain ol' "links" into what
you call "bookmarks"....additional programming to make them behave in ways
they don't by nature....is that correct? And these are mostly not things WP
links/bookmarks are capable of right now, right? I keep hearing you say you
"want" your WP links to behave in all these different ways, but they don't
right now. So basically, you're actually advocating a change in the entire
function of links/bookmarks/blogroll, not just a naming convention. Am I
getting close? :)

I'm not opposed to extending the functionality of links to include being
able to make them behave in new and trendy ways, but ultimately they are
still links. And I still think MOST people are still just going to want to
make links.

Otto, you have a great use for social bookmarks and lots of ideas for them
that I have no objection to whatsover.... but it has been my understanding
that the developers of WP want to keep the core pretty basic, and relegate
the unique, extended functionality to plugins. Maybe that is the best way.
If you want your links to do all those things, perhaps you (or someone)
could write a plugin. Then others who want their links to do that, can have
it, and the rest of WP users can have their plain ol' links.

Just a thought...

Marci :)
PS I would like to hear from the devs too. This is only a bikeshed
discussion if they say it is. :)

Where I was going was to say that for the purposes of the Admin of WP I
think the name Links is most accurate, and least confusing to most people.
If all these extra features are added as part of the CORE functionality of
WP, then maybe they will warrant a new name. But still I would suggest
something new like xLinks, for extended links, rather than bookmarks, which
again, MOST people think of as being something personal stored in their
browser....unless they are into social bookmarking, which I still think MOST
people who use the web for business are not.

Yes and no. To a large degree, yes, I want them to be capable of more.
But, a lot of the things I'm suggesting they are capable of right now.

But categories are similar to tagging, for example. They had ratings
(and still do in the database).

No. What I'm saying is that "Bookmarks" are basically "links with
support structure", by any realistic definition. Wordpress's Bookmarks
fit that description. Yes, I'd like them to do more, but they are
already Bookmarks. They are already more than links.

If that is all that "most" people want, then why not remove the
functionality entirely?

No, seriously, you can make groups of "links" using a Text widget, can
you not? They look much the same in the sidebar regardless of whether
or not you use the links widget with bookmarks or a text widget with
a-href's in it, right?

So why have it at all, if all you want to do is put links in the sidebar?

I fully agree. However, in order for this to occur, there must be some
more basic support structures available to do it with. I'm not
avocating adding all the *functionality*, I'm advocating adding the
support structure to do that sort of thing with. Generic, basic,
structure to be used in all sorts of ways.

Taxonomy is rapidly evolving in trunk. Why not add the ability to
include generic taxonomy with the links table? Right now, I can
associate posts to multiple "words" in the taxonomy structure, so why
can't I associate links with multiple "words" in the same way?

The links table has a lot of columns, many of which are unused or
single use columns only. Why not have a links_meta table instead,
which associates any sort of key/value metadata to the links? It works
very well for posts.

> Then others who want their links to do that, can have

The rest of WP users already have their "plain ol' links". Text
Widgets replace what you're suggesting in all possible ways.

I'm not going to argue with you, because all of what you posted above
is opinion, which you are perfectly entitled to. Instead, I'll just
state that I categorically and totally disagree with everything you
stated in the above paragraph. There is not one single point at which
we agree on anything there. Not a one. In short, I'm not going to
argue with you because I would have to write a complete essay on how
wrong I think you are. ;-)

I'm in the middle of setting up a WP based site for my wife. Last  
night I left her playing around in the admin. She seemed to work out  
what it was all about without my help except... 'wtf is a blogroll?'  
she asked. 'Links' I said. 'Then why not call them links?' she replied.

I forgot to address this specifically, like I meant to...

Simple refutation: Go to http://blogs.wsj.com. Look at any entry on
any of the Wall Street Journal's blogs. You'll find this at the bottom
of the entry:
"Share on Facebook | Del.icio.us | Digg this"

Social Bookmarking is extremely commonplace in the modern world. Even
the Wall Street Journal does it.

Oops - this poll gives a choice between Links and Blogroll, not Links  
and Bookmarks.
And it  requires registration to vote,  which will seriously limit it.

I've posted a Democracy poll here:

I disagree. No  matter  how many features are added  to  this URL   
management feature, no matter  expansive  its underlying architecture  
someday  becomes, it'll  still be a pile  of links at the  end  of  
the  day, and this  interface  will  still be used for managing those  
links. I think a lot  of these  distinctions between what  links  or  
bookmarks "truly are" are fluid definitions subject to   
interpretation. However, we all  agree  that they're ultimately  
links. We  don't  all  agree that they're ultimately bookmarks.

Also: No matter  how  many fancy features the URL  manager eventually  
acquires, the  vast majority of  people  will  still use it to   
create a simple list  of URLs in their sidebars. In other  words,   
some developers  may see  it  as more  than a link manager, but most   
users  will not.

I don't agree with that. They don't have to be links. They're
currently all ultimately rendered as anchor tags in some form or
fashion, but I don't think that is necessarily a fixed and unchanging
thing.

Predicting the future, are we? People here are arguing about the
current state of the internet and what "most" people do, and you're
going to predict what they will do with something that hasn't even
been done yet? Amazing. ;-)

sorry, let me be more clear.

There are cases when plugins need to create/manage/teardown their own  
link to the same database that WP uses using the exact same user  
credentials.  This is very handy when you need a dedicated or  
persistent db link or need to produce and ignore errors on that link.  
PHP's mysql_connect will attempt to reuse an existing connection with  
the same credentials unless you set the new_link bool.

What I was suggesting was to force php to create a new link to the DB  
when $wpdb is _first_ created - not every time it's accessed. The  
benefit here is that Wordpress is then guaranteed to have it's own db  
connection instead of potentially piggy-backing on one that is  
already created by a plugin that is using the same db credentials.

Thanks Jennifer, we had thought about this but didn't have time to implement
- hopefully we'll have it in the next major revision.

There is a specific optimization that would be nice, but I can't figure out
how to do it with the available hooks.  Currently, if the reCAPTCHA guess is
incorrect, the comment is still processed and stored temporarily in the
database.  Only at the last moment before showing the comment page with the
error message is it deleted from the database.  Does anyone know how to stop
it before new_comment is called?  It looks like this would break
comments-post.php though.

If you want to produce and ignore errors then call $wpdb->hide_errors
and $wpdb->show_errors around your queries.

wp-db.php is included way before plugins and so it would be the other
way round -> the plugin would be piggybacking on the normal wpdb link.

I don't see how making this change to $wpdb to mean that it always
creates a new connection is benificial to most users of WordPress.

If you have a specific situation where you need this functionality then
override wpdb with your own db class using the functionality provided.

They're supporting it by maintaining their own timezone/offset  
database for PHP 4 compat... so they'll have that maintenance burden.

Sure... the plugin can just update the offset option in the  
database.  When it enters a DST range, it can change it to the new  
offset.

But in the end, you are storing a URL.  The simplest, most meaningful
and vastly most common use of this feature is for displaying links in
your sidebar or on a separate links page.  Despite your insistence
that there are a myriad of other uses, I have yet to hear any of them,
much less one that will be useful to 99% of WP users.

I believe that we should call this feature "Links" to reduce the
confusion of WP users (all the new/non-bloggers that I've installed it
for have been confused by the term "blogroll").  That should be the
core because that will be the only feature that will be useful to 99%
of users.

People who want to expand upon that can feel free to do so.  If you
need more hooks in the API, write them up and try to get them into the
core.  If you come up with really cool functionality ontop of those
hooks that a majority of people will find useful, I'm sure you'll be
able to get that into the core too.

Another captcha plugin `cryptographp' does that.

It might help you to look in its source code .
# It seems `wp_die()' works for it.

Thanks for the suggestion.  We used wp_die() in our first version but only
some browsers save the comment when using the back button, and this didn't
allow for error messages in the reCAPTCHA widget.

So, for the first post you wrote:

> feedback 

I would say it's prefer to use Ajax tech - asynchronously checking.
Send input words in background and give feedback (for users enable
JavaScript to their browser).

Alternatively, you can recommend to use reCAPTCHA plugin with my small 
plugin. :)
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/get-error-message-there/

This plugin sends a comment via XMLRPC and get a response. 
When it finds an error message in the response which wp_die() put, it
picks up the message and insert it into the original window which
comment editing.
If no error founds then it leads browser to reload the post/Page.
It's not efficient approach to force reloading, but works with any WP
enables other Ajaxed plugins(such as `WP AJAX Edit Comments').


# I wonder why WP core developers leaves that issue;
# Edited comments may lost, to which users spend precious time to write
# not only for themselves but also for blog/Page authors, due to paring
# of forgetful browser and poor error reporting mechanism. :p

As far as I can remember, comments were on for pages and posts by 
default originally. I always remember through various versions of WP 
that one I had made a WP page, I had to make sure the dang comments 
option was turned off for it. IMHO, it's stupid and pointless to have 
comment on pages LOL! But, everyone likes their own thing, so... no 
offense of course.. :P

Huh, in all the times I've made a Page, comments have never been enabled on

you are right. after testing this out the issue is that prior to v2.1  
wp-db.php was calling the mysql_error() method without specifying the  
link resource. that would print errors on all links. It looks like  
this was fixed in v2.1 but it's still out there in the wild for  
people running v2.0.

$wpdb->hide_errors() is your friend.

Which theme do you use?  Sandbox doesn't show the form unless you use a
custom meta field in the page to turn it on.  Some themes just don't show
comments on pages period.

I think you're getting confused with comments being _enabled_ and the
comment code being _present_ in the template.

A page could have comments enabled, but the page template doesn't
include the comment code (or in the case of Sandbox, it gets disabled by
the non-presence of the custom field).

I'd be interested to know what these cases are, because I can't think
of any. Plugins already have the $wpdb connection available to them,
why would they ever need to make another connection to the same DB?

You're missing my point. $wpdb is first created every time anybody
loads a page on the website. PHP is not persistent across hits. So
forcing every single hit to the site to always get a new DB link is a
huge amount of overhead for next to no gain.

FireStats for example, does not depend on WordPress (it can work as 
standalone), so it has its own database infrastructure.

Clarification:

Using the method below, the comments page is either present or  
entirely gone, as distinct from whether it is enabled or not.

Is this for the FireStats stand-alone implementation? Regardless, I  
think the rule should be don't mess with the global $wpdb object. Use  
it but don't try to manipulate it. End of issue.

If you want/need to create your own connection (dumb in my opinion)  
then create your own instance of the WPDB class.

// From inside your plugin
// You will need to make sure wpdb.php is included.
$my_wpdb = new wpdb($USER, $PASSWORD, $NAME, $HOST);

As I said, I have my own db connectivity infrastructure, and I can't 
depend on wordpress (or its classes) for that.
the point here that some plugins DO have to create their own connection, 
it has nothing to do with wpdb. (I don't think any plugin should try to 
'manipulate' it).

Don't randomly decide that "now" is a good time, when this hasn't  
changed.

This hasn't changed, and is still related to 1.

Mark Jaquith said in IRC this would be fixed in 2.0.11. Ryan Boren  
has since said such bugfixes will never go into 2.0.x. Can we please  
have consistency between commiters about what does and does not go  
into the 2.0 branch?

Validators aren't the end all of conformance, but if they say  
something is wrong, and you can't find anything in the spec to  
contradict it, the validator is probably right.

Actually read the bug report?

Add a method to switch to HTML, or avoid hard-coding any HTML in core.

The latter suggestion to avoid calling libraries directly makes it

I've been watching the poll on birdhouse.org with interest. So far it's a
landslide, which I honestly did not expect. But....there have only been 45
respondents. Has this been posted to the WP forum where it can get
sufficient attention from non-hackers? I did a search for it, but I don't
want to double post it. It should probably be a sticky.

Just for fun, I Googled del.icio.us last night -- there are over 2,000,000
hits for the word "links" on their site alone! I thought that was kind of
ironic. :)

Also, I found this:

Whether public opinion counts in the WP decision making process is an  
open question I suppose, but results on this poll so far show a very  
strong user preference for "Links" over "Bookmarks":

It's an admittedly small sample size, but the opinion trend looks  
fairly clear to me.

How about adding everything as "links", no matter if they are from the 
sidebar/widgets or from posts? Then users can add all kinds of metadata 
(xfn, image, description, whatever) to them and place links from a post 
to their sidebar and vica verca.

Links from the post could be added to the same category as the post itself.

That what Open Web analytics does as well. it creates it's own  
connection but uses the same credentials.

The issue I found was fixed in v2.1 when wp-db.php was fixed to call  
for mysql errors on it's own link instead of on the last used link.  
So this is not an issue anymore but something that plugin developers  
should be aware of if they want to support v2.0 installs and need to  
produce and ignore errors on their own DB link.

I've written a script to convert old (pre-WP2.2 Reboot) tags and categories
to the new system. 

You can see its results on my site @ http://neosmart.net/blog/
If you see anything weird there (with regards to the tagging system), please
let me know!

Instructions:

0. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE!!!!!!!!!!!
1. Download EZSQL and extract to your HD (I'm using ezsql for db access)
2. Upgrade your blog to the latest SVN
3. Upgrade your database via the db upgrade wizard
4. EMPTY (not delete) tables: wp_terms, wp_term_taxonomy,
wp_term_relationships
5. Download http://neosmart.ath.cx/CatConvert.txt
6. Change $includes in CatConvert.txt to the path to EZSQL files (only
Core.php and MySQL.php are needed); and update database server variables.
7. Rename CatConvert.txt to CatConvert.php and run.
8. Check if it works and reply to this email.

You can even upgrade from UTW by using the import wizard then running this.
You _may_ choose to delete wp_categories and wp_post2cat if you are
satisfied with the result.

WP-Stats says that it doesn't record visits from logged-in users.

May I ask why? I have several thousand users in my WP database (registration
is open to the public) and these are the ones who visit and comment
regularly.

WP-Stats should exclude contributors and admins, but should include normal
users (subscribers), IMHO.

Subject: [wp-hackers] using translated strings for action names
Message-ID: <468683C2.2050503@m0n5t3r.info>

The new options page mechanism (using an action hook to get potions 
pages and other types of admin section custom pages) builds the action 
names dynamically, so, for instance, for an options page defined like this:

add_options_page("Foo config", "Foo", 5, "foo")

tries to run an action called "options_page_foo"

This seems reasonable (although it looks like a textbook case for the 
YAFL antipattern), but...

when using l10n, "options" becomes "einstellungen" in German, "optiuni" 
in Romanian, "opciones" in Spanish, and who knows what in other 
languages, which leads to wordpress trying respectively 
"einstellungen_page_foo", "optiuni_page_foo", "opciones_page_foo",  etc.

Am I the only one who thinks this is a (trying my best to be polite) bad 
choice?


P.S. a workaround is to use sanitize_title(__("Options")) . "_page_foo" 
for the action name.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Advantage (or not) of hosting badges
Message-ID: <a6128e200706301606o417e9554vf9fc1b55108e2b15@mail.gmail.com>

This isn't a WP issue, just a general question to which I haven't been able
to find an answer.

I have a site that wants to have some level of privacy protection in terms
of who they give permission to use their badges, so it seems  like putting
them out in the open is a bad idea. They could be on a private page....there
are lots of options I realize....but I keep wondering about how I sometimes
see "you MUST use my HTML to link to this badge" -- and I haven't been able
to figure out if they are doing some kind of tracking -- which would be a
nice feature for this site. Can anyone tell me the advantage of hosting
images and insisting people link to them? In the past that was always a
no-no because of bandwidth usage.

Any insights would be appreciated!

Marci :)
