Subject: [wp-hackers] i18n for information in database
Message-ID: <CAA5Fzwa_+cqT8i3pj_cDk+rCHqnPgovX4cjUgMC9zK-5MLWyUg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a plugin where users can embed calculators on their site.  All these
calculators are stored as posts on my main site and all the
fields/formula/etc are custom fields.  I've received several user requests
to translate some of these.  Is there a standard way to be able to translate
data coming out of the database?

The approach I'm planning on doing is just to wrap the outputs of these
fields in the i18n functions and then write a script to generate a .pot file
from the database.  This is sort of working, but I am getting some errors in
my pot file so I may not be escaping properly.

Is this the best way to handle this situation?

Message-ID: <25036509.53.1312217648292.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@yqdg35>

I got pointed to a thread on "Warrior Forums" (some online marketing forum), 
where someone (overnight211) states that you will gain "100% private label 
rights" on Plugins like "WP-DB Manager", "WP-Print" (and about 100 more) 
with a purchase of his plugin bundle. He also says that it's a "Perfect 
Product to Send To Your List Re-branded with your affliliate links". At some 
other comments you can read stuff like the following: "I have *Full Master 
Resale Rights* and Each One of the Plugins Listed Above Has Resale 
Privileges attached to them. Because of the Master Rights, I have the each 
developers *expressed permission* to offer *Private Label Rights* to All Who 
Purchase WP Million Dollar Plugins".

I don't comment on this, but want to encourage you to this yourself right at 
the Warrior Forum. Maybe you're one of the plugin authors and want to 
contact him personally or through your law suit (or your friendly local 
hooligan team). I hope Automattic will jump in on some point too. Here's the 
Link<http://www.warriorforum.com/warrior-forum-classified-ads/424733-finally-money-making-wp-plugins-instanly-turn-your-boring-websites-into-35-625-yr-atm-machines.html>
.

Wish you best,
Kaiser.

Note that re-selling GPL plugins is perfectly acceptable per the terms of
the license. (The GPL explicitly allows for selling GPL-licensed works.)

However, in this case, the GPL is violated in that the person selling this
compilation claims that purchasers cannot give the compilation away for
free, but can only sell it for an equal ($9) or greater value.

If he were to remove that restriction, as far as I can tell, he would be in
complete compliance with GPL.

"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."

If he removes that restriction and truly does comply with GPL, it's still uncool in my book.

Two cents, please.

In section 4. and in 6.b) detail the specifics of selling works, as far 
as I have read:
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

tl;dr You can charge anything for verbatim conveying, and for non-source 
conveying, a source distribution should be included at no more than the 
cost to physically perform.

It would be worth contacting the Software Freedom Law Center over this, 
not sure if Automattic has a relationship already with them....

FWIW, the guy has already changed his terms and is now offering his bundle
for free with no restrictions.

This kind of thing happens fairly common, and as sleazy as it seems, is
probably not really a bad thing. As the saying goes, "any well-developed
ecosystem has its parasites" and it doesn't hurt the overall ecosystem.

On using the transient cache with http api would this be correct?

I spend a lot of time on Warriors (I find a lot of potential customers for
our Your Members Membership Plugin there) and I could write a book on what
an peculiar eco-system it is in itself and the absolute opposite of every
geek community I'm proud to be part of. I also can never work out who their
market is, possibly themselves because after you've seen one
get-rich-quick-online scheme and visited one monster-length OptimizePress
sales page, you've seen them all. I can't believe people buy into what they
sell, but they seem to! Everything is about the bottom line everyone is
trying to push their own get rich quick scheme, that's not to say their
isn't a sense of community, there is, but is so orientated on faster ways to
make a million online, that it'll all seem very alien to your average hacker
(full disclosure, I'm a former hacker turned marketer, so I'm can live on
both sides of the fence)

I've also seen some shocking examples of code over there. People were going
nuts over some new WordPress based sales tool a few weeks ago, dozen of
people posting they'd bought it, only for the author to add "hey somebody
suggested some great advanced security features, so in the next version
we'll be adding a PayPal IPN handler"* !

(* If you're not familiar with PayPal, it means he admitted it a public
thread, where is customers are talking to him, that Payments can be faked by
generating false form data and possibly the referrer header).

Please fair WordPress Hackers, stay away from Warriors for your own sake. It
was once describe to me as "being locked in a room full us real estate
agents and used car salesman, they day somebody told them they could make a
million on the internet".

Without getting my old soap box back out, the real problem of course is that
as Automattic won't consider plugins to be none-derivative, it means people
aren't free to release their plugins under a license that allows them to be
freely distributed but not for profit.

It's fine, but I would move the json_decode up before the
set_transient, so that you're storing the already decoded data instead
of the raw response from the other server. This saves you some time
and space in that you don't have to decode it every time.

Best to store just what you need in the transient, already processed
and ready to use. Faster that way.

Also, you can save yourself a few lines of code by using this pattern:

if ( false === ( $data = get_transient( 'whatever' ) ) ) {
 ...
 set_transient( 'whatever', $data, $timeout );
}

The first line in the if statement both gets the data and checks it
against false. This works because the result of an assignment is the
value that was assigned.

I've downloaded plug-ins with obfuscated PHP, plugin ended up being 
pointless, even after running a formatter on it (doesn't take long). 
I've also have seen jobs posted of people trying to make non-free or 
obfuscated plugins, and it just sounds like a bunch of confusion on 
their part.

For those interested in non-free or obfuscated plugins: Privacy is cool, 
proprietary is uncool: Just don't share a plugin to the whole Internet, 
and keep it private until it's actually been proven to be useful. There 
are so many WordPress plugins, and so many of them pretty sloppy. There 
really isn't a need for obfuscated or proprietary plug-ins, as would be 
more possible with BSD licensed software....

BTW, obfuscation is specifically not allowed in the wordpress.org
plugins repo, so if you find one, please report it.

Note: Paypal buttons often look obfuscated in some way. That's normal
for paypal. That's allowed. Don't report those.

Email plugins at wordpress.org with the relevant information. Linking to
the plugin and specifying which file has the code in it helps too.

Would the json decode be in the if statement? Just a line before set
transient, or do you mean before the if?

Cause the response is coming from the http api in the if statement.

You'd do the json_decode in the if statement and then store the
decoded response. Like so:

if ( false === ( $parsedResponse = get_transient( $cache_key ) ) ) {
       $response = wp_remote_retrieve_body(wp_remote_get($requestUrl));
       $parsedResponse = json_decode($response, true);
       set_transient($cache_key,$parsedResponse,60*60*12);
}

This way, your parsed response, which is all you actually care about,
is what you're storing in the transient in the first place. No need to
store the raw data then have to decode it on every page load.

Ecosystem? Err... There be no plants, air, dirt, owls, rain or any of 
that here. But maybe a family of dragons!

What it does hurt is the community, and moral.

The wp_insert_term() function differs slightly, due to the fact it's
primary use is to create, rather than update.

The signature in expanded form is:
wp_insert_term( Name, Taxonomy, array( Slug, Parent, Alias Of, Description) )

whereas, wp_update_term is
wp_update_term( Term ID, Taxonomy, array( Name, Slug, Parent, Alias
Of, Description) )
as you're operating on the Term ID rather than the Term Name..

I'm not sure what documentation you're looking at, as I always suggest
looking at the source when something doesnt make sense.

It completely makes sense, it just seems odd - there is no good reason
for wp_insert_term not to allow you to insert the name and the time of
creation of the term. Especially as wp_update_term does.

Sorry, I didn't make it clear enough then. The Name is the first
parameter of the wp_insert_term() function, as it's what's being
"Created", whereas, the update function it's in the args, as it's the
Term ID that's being operated on.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Cyrillic slugs in pages
Message-ID: <1312442579.3082.7.camel@valio>

Hi , i have problems with cyrillic slugs in WordPress 3.2.1 , problem is
when url is copied to aim , or skype or posted into link , wordpress
gives 404 not found , when link is inside wordpres - menu or in post or
page - it is ok. categories and posts are working just fine when url is
pasted like external link . my permalinks structure is - /%category%/%
postname%/ but , from what i know it is only for posts and not pages , i
use nested pages structure , so some of my pages slugs looks like : 
http://example.com/????????/????????2/????????3/

any ideas how to fix that ? 
thanks in advance.

Subject: [wp-hackers] shortcodes with dash conflict?
Message-ID: <6ECC4BD3-F4A1-4804-AE95-F7D1460591CD@codehooligans.com>

This morning I was contacted by someone using my plugin, Media-Tags. The reported issues is the shortcode I'm providing via the plugin [media-tags] is somehow being hijacked by another plugin, wordTube. 

So I downloaded this wordTube plugin. And found where is registers a shortcode [media]. And was able to confirm when I add my plugin's shortcode [media-tags] to a Page it will somehow be passed to the wordTube plugin instead of my Media-Tags plugin. 

So my question is should I instead be using [mediatags] or [media_tags] instead of [media-tags]? Is there something in the regex pattern matching where the dash is effecting the logic? Anyone?

Thanks, that helps. I did it like them and spit out a file with all the
strings calling the __ function and just used POEdit to actually generate
the pot file instead of trying to generate the pot file myself like I was
doing previously.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Cyrillic slugs in pages

Ok, i just found the solution :

wp-includes/class-wp.php line 162

-- 			$req_uri = str_replace($pathinfo, '', $req_uri);
++                    $req_uri = str_replace($pathinfo, '',
strtolower($req_uri));

Hope that helps ...
Cheers

Subject: [wp-hackers] Template Hierarchy In A Plugin
Message-ID: <732006E815B848BDA8216C9FAD19D19B@gmail.com>

 Dear all, 

What is the best way to take advantage of the way in which WordPress automatically guesses, and correctly loads the right template for a custom post type, but within a plugin rather than a theme?

So in a plugin I load a series of custom post types, and tell WordPress where the template files for them are, which it then loads in an automated manner. So album-single.php loads as we would expect if it were under the template directory and so on? 

I attempted to Google this, but obviously quite difficult to get through the thickets of results to it out!

Thanks for the help,

Alex

I've been migrating a site, and well, something isn't right. The original site was in a subdirectory. The new site is at root. All the text works (I think), and I've deleted the .htaccess file and recreated it by renewing the permalinks. But still, for images that go in posts, I have the directory in their path, so they call fail.

Where in the MySQL database are image paths stored? There are many hundreds, but if it's easy I feel I might be best to just change their path in the database itself.

Any advice? Any pointers?

Thanks so much,
John

The URL's you're refering to are most likely within post content? If
so, The URL is stored within the HTML of the post itself.
If you move between domains, the recomended way is to use the
Export/Import process which takes care of changing paths.
However, in this case, you can simply do a search/replace for the old
url, and replace with the new url. A plugin such as Search and
Replace: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-and-replace/ or
using direct SQL replacements is the normal way to update those
details.

Nice one, this will be useful, run into issues with this all the time.

I really wish all images would be shortcodes if they are in the Media 
Library so their URLS are not baked in.

Also, you could use .htaccess redirect rules for the wp-content/uploads 
directory of the old location to the new location? Would also keep 
existing links out you can't change working.

I've heard that before, but how would it actually be done?
The difference, in this case, is one directory, "wordpress".

Try adding something like this to your .htaccess or in your Apache 
virtual host config:

RewriteRule ^/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/(.*)$    
http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/$1 [L,R=301]

Thank you Braydon.
Would this help avoid Google cache bounces? The site I'm migrating already existed and would be indexed. The posts will redirect, but not the images, perhaps? This rule would help, correct, even if I do find and replace in the actual database?

Thanks again,
John

If I understand you correctly, you want to load a template file to display a
custom post type from your plugin directory, whereas WordPress would
normally look for the appropriate template file in a theme.

You should look at the 'template_include' filter. Something like this code
(not tested) might work.

add_filter( 'template_include', 'template_include' );
function my_template_include( $template ) {
if ( 'album' === get_query_var( 'post_type' ) ) {
if ( is_single() ) {
 return dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/single-album.php';
} else { // loop
 return dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/archive-album.php';
}
}
 return $template;
} // end my_template_include

Thanks very much. That's sort of what I meant, however, what I really wanted is the ability to 'virtually' extend the template directory. So I could just run a filter or function then the directory ribcage/templates (say) would be a directory that is also automatically searched for the template of my custom post type. Might this be a good thing to suggest in a patch if it doesn't exist?

I guess what I could do is duplicate the intelligent loader from the template file (i.e. the thing which tells it if we have a custom post type then look here and here), but this seems a rather long winded way and I thought there might be something more elegant. I guess I could hook in at the point of the code you have kindly provided and do this somewhat automatically. 

Thanks lot.

Precisely like that! It is odd to me that this hasn't come up before - surely plugin developers find the need to theme custom post types their plugins will be adding?

All the best,

You can style custom post types from plugins already, using
'template_redirect' + load_template() but it's pretty fragile and it's
something better left for themes to do, anyway.

We really need to have full manual mode for URL and templates and take 
WordPress to the Grand Prix.

I'd just like to point out, that allowing plugins to inject template
files into themes is not always going to work properly.. Why? Quite
simply because every theme out there is written with a different HTML
structure and styling/class names.
Try taking a page from the old Default theme and droping it into the
2011 folder, it's not going to work, Take a file designed for the 2011
theme and drop it into a Genesis theme, it's not going to work.
Take a file from a plugin and expect it to work in everyones themes..
it's not going to work..

What everyone "actually" needs (IMHO) is:
 * To modify the output of the_content() for their CPT or
 * To be able to add pages with shortcodes easier (ie. so that
/plugin-page/ is handled by their plugin)
Neither of those would really be achievable by letting a plugin inject
their document into the template hierarchy..

That's actually a good point. How would you implement this? Though I think the plugin I am developing is sufficiently specialist (i.e. it changes the whole feel of the site) that the interruption of template files is okay.

All the best,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Shortcode embedded within shortcode -- is it possible?
Message-ID: <CACOUsBW3Cpu-+tav3QThe5fVM9LwoSEzM--WeeiycGiX_7SESg@mail.gmail.com>

The real world problem is a need to use aws s3 signed urls with
existing flowplayer plugin.

I offered code to flowplayer that would allow them to transparently
handle the s3 signed urls, but since there is still only a small
community of folks with a need for this feature, they were
understandably hesitant to take new code under their wing.

So my need is to find a way to dynamically refactor the video url at
runtime (during each page view). This is because the signed urls
typically have a 60 minutes lifetime.

I tried just putting a shortcode inside the other shortcode.
[FLOWPLAYER=http://domain.com/splash.jpg|[s3signedlink
url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myvideo.mp4],600,450]

That was a fail. Worth a try. But, at the time did not work for me. I
don't know php well enough yet to determine if the core shortcode
handler can deal with inline shortcodes within other shortcodes.

The note in wp-includes/shortcodes.php seems to indicate that the
simplistic approach will not work.

13	 * Shortcode tags support attributes and enclosed content, but does
not entirely
14	 * support inline shortcodes in other shortcodes. You will have to call the
15	 * shortcode parser in your function to account for that.
17	 * {@internal
18	 * Please be aware that the above note was made during the beta of
WordPress 2.6
19	 * and in the future may not be accurate. Please update the note
when it is no
20	 * longer the case.}}

So I'm looking for a clue on how to approach this. I'm a bit new to
php and much of the codex assumes more than the sparse background I
have currently.

Perhaps there is a hook or filter I can use that would allow me to get
at the video url in the flowplayer shortcode before it is processed.

Thanks for any hints.

Regards,
Claude Needham

This may be obvious, but it should be helpful for you to test the short 
codes separately first, making sure each works as expected individually.

Additionally, if you need to bandaid the process, you could make the 
inner short code brackets [] be braces {} and convert them to brackets 
via the outer short code's processing.

So you start with something like this:
[FLOWPLAYER=http://domain.com/splash.jpg|{s3signedlink
url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myvideo.mp4},600,450]

causing one of the parameters to be

{s3signedlink url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myvideo.mp4}

which gets converted to

[s3signedlink url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/myvideo.mp4]

and processed as a short code.


I don't know if that will help or not, but it might give you a direction 
to go...

Brian,

I don't have access to the guts of the Flowplayer plugin. Unless I
hack it, then I would have to hack it every time they upgraded the
plugin.

So I would need to wrap the flowplayer inside my shortcode.

Is there a safe way to do this that will allow me to execute the
flowplayer shortcode transparently?

Or should I be looking for a hook or filter that will allow me to
process the pre-content before it goes into the shortcode processor?

Is there a time line displaying where the hooks and filters happen on
the time line?

Thanks for the hints.
Claude

Message-ID: <A30AB603-9B97-49DA-938D-1446402611F0@powerfoundation.org>

Can anyone give me some pointers on a custom widget?

I'm working with a theme that renders categories on the front page. As the client has a site that has a great many stories in each category, he wants to list more categories in a list view as shown in the mockup below (I photoshoped it to show what I need to do, masked in red).

I want to keep the layout of the theme, but the thing I'm struggling with is not placing a new widget, or finding a script that pulls up recent posts in a category. Rather, I don't know how to render a certain number of returns in columns.

Below, in the mockup, there are seven, or 21 as a total. I'd love it to look like this, if at all possible.

I hope it's not a misuse of this list, but I'd really appreciate if anyone could give me a few pointers on how to create this.

Thanks so much,
ian

	shortcode
Message-ID: <CACOUsBUFyZZ3my8ueK338f1h9qPrrfh=PFw-_TjUFVFb2bv1uw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to embed an archive of the five most recent posts for a
particular category in the main content of a page.

I have managed to do this with some success by editing the page template.

However, it would be better to do this via a shortcode -- so that page
content can appear before and after the archive.

I've done this wrong in two different way.

When I managed to create an infinite loop, I decided it was time to
see if there is example code or at least a clue about the proper
method
for implementing a custom query within the main content of a page.

Any pointers would be appreciated.

Claude Needham

I'm developing a plugin that other plugins can integrate with, they will
need access to a function within my plugin. Obviously, if their plugin is
loaded before mine, it will result in an error. How do I ensure that my
plugin will be loaded first?

Likewise, if I want to build in some compatibility with another plugin
(BuddyPress), how do I make sure that is loaded before mine?

I could use 'plugins_loaded' with a high priority, but that doesn't seem
very foolproof to me?

Put simply: No plugin should execute any logic upon being included.
The only real functions you should ever need to call are: add_action,
add_filter, and register_*_hook.

All code can usually be executed on the init hook, which is the
earliest you can expect WordPress (and plugins) to be loaded and ready
for action..
If you need to run code which is going to affect how WordPress loads,
the plugins_loaded hook can be useful.
If you need to run code which relies upon another plugins code running
first, and they're behaving themselves, running your code LATE on the
init hook should allow your plugin to run after the other plugin has
run.

Message-ID: <CAK3PZGtogN4zfWdyC5QjkZOo4z2vcxxeALWvksRBebbYybkkLQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a plugin in the WP repository (BuddyPress Like) which I haven't
updated in quite some time. I'm working on a new plugin that will replicate
all of the functionality of BP Like, but will not be BuddyPress specific.
There will be an importer so all BP Like data will move into the new plugin
seamlessly.

What is the best practice for effectively depreciating an old plugin and
direct users to a new one?

Ideally I could rename BP Like in the repository, and just have the new
version replace the old one... but renaming isn't possible?

I've looked into add_action / do_action and it fits my needs perfectly!

So I guess I'd like to know if you can rename a plugin in the repo - and if
you can't, how would I do something similar?

Changing the plugin slug is not possible. Nor should you be trying to
do so, the slug is outside the scope of the plugin user's view. If you
want to give the plugin a different name, then just change the name in
the PHP file.

If you are deprecating an old plugin and want to switch users to
another one, then there is a way, but it's a bit complex and not
guaranteed. It works because the plugin URL has a slightly higher
priority than the plugin slug in the matching algorithm.

In the plugin's PHP file, there's a place in the header to put the
Plugin URI:. WordPress.org treats this as a unique identifier for the
plugin. The URI value you put here should be something unique to the
plugin and within your control (so, something on your own site and not
a wordpress.org URL).

When a plugin update request is made by a site, that URI field is sent
along and used to match against plugins in the repository. Again,
wordpress.org URIs are ignored here.

If the URIs match, then that value has a slightly higher weight than
the directory-name to slug match does.

Now, obviously, if both the URI and the slug matched, then this
wouldn't matter. However, if you shift the Plugin URI value on an old
plugin to match that of a new plugin, then wait for your users to all
update, and then remove the URI value on the old plugin, now the only
match that plugin has is the slug match, and the plugin URI will match
the new plugin, and outweigh it. Thus causing those users to see an
update to your new, different, plugin.

You could go further with this and just update ALL of the old plugin
to the new plugin code, Plugin URI included, then leave it a while,
and eventually just remove the plugin files from the old plugin's
repository. Without anything to match against, the old plugin will
match the new plugin in the update check, and will get its updates.
This is a simpler and more direct approach, and probably more likely
to succeed. Plus your users instantly get all the benefits of your new
plugin.

I have not actually done this, nor have I heard of anybody doing it.
But from my reading of the code, it should work.

Subject: [wp-hackers] WordPress 3 - Problem with menu highlighting
Message-ID: <4E42B1D8.50905@danwashere.com>

Hi all, this is my first mail here so let me know if I'm doing anything 
wrong? I couldn't find a posting guide for this list, so I'll just go 
for it.

I've already asked this on Stackoverflow but I'm getting no help there:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6855909/wordpress-3-problem-with-menu-highlighting

I'm building a site that has a two level menu created with the admin 
Menu tool. The menu contains links to both Pages and Category lists. It 
doesn't link directly to Posts. The problem is that when you drill down 
into a Category list and click to view a single post in that Category, 
the menu highlighting gets it wrong.

I've tested on a new install of WP3, set up a simple test site with a 
few pages and posts in 3 categories. All I've changed in the theme is 
the style.css to highlight the whole path.
http://danwashere.com/wp_dev/
Here's a direct link to view a categorised post here:
http://danwashere.com/wp_dev/2011/07/28/blue-rocks/

Everything is a page, except with the section "Advice Categories" - all 
those sub items are category lists containing categorised posts - each 
post is only categorised with a single category. The menu structure is 
defined entirely in the Menu settings.
On that Blue Rocks page, the menu should be highlighted like this: 
Advice Categories -> Rocks, but it's highlighting the Sample Page item. 
And if you rollover the "Advice Categories" menu, you'll see that it is 
correctly highlighting the "Rocks" menu item.

It seems to me that WP is applying the 'current-post-parent' class to 
the wrong top menu item, but maybe I'm missing something?

Many thanks,
Dan

Problem solved.

Turns out I was vastly under-estimating the subtly of wordpress.

The nested loops section
(http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop#Nested_Loops) gave me the clue.

I did not realize that the_content etc would access the data for the
$my_query object. I was stupidly trying to craft some means of doing
the_content with $my_query directly. (A bit of not so useful example
code from a google search put me in the wrong direction. I think I'll
keep site:wordpress.org in my google searches from now on.)

When I stopped fiddling with all the dials it settled down and worked
like a charm.

Very impressive behind the scenes magic going on in wp.

Special thanks to codex contributors for including that "nested loops" bit.

Regards,
Claude Needham

First things first: you asked on the wrong StackExchange site. Try this one:
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/

<http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/>Second, you might try something like
this function, to apply single-cat highlighting:

function oenology_show_current_cat_on_single($output) {

global $post;

if( is_single() ) {

$categories = wp_get_post_categories($post->ID);

foreach( $categories as $catid ) {
$cat = get_category($catid);
// Find cat-item-ID in the string
if(preg_match('#cat-item-' . $cat->cat_ID . '#', $output)) {
$output = str_replace('cat-item-'.$cat->cat_ID, 'cat-item-'.$cat->cat_ID . '
current-cat', $output);
}
}

}
return $output;
}
// Hook current_cat function into 'wp_list_categories'
add_filter('wp_list_categories', 'oenology_show_current_cat_on_single');


Note, here it's being hooked into wp_list_categories, but you could also try
wp_list_pages, or, wp_page_menu. I'm not sure if there's a wp_nav_menu
filter? Have to check...

Hope this helps!

Hi there,

I was looking at the documentation for edit_comment, and I see there's 
only one hook executed AFTER the comment has been edited. Would it be 
possible to have something like delete_comment / deleted_comment, or in 
other words two hooks, one executed BEFORE the comment is edited (useful 
to see what has been changed) and one AFTER? I could not find any 
tickets for this, should I add one to trac as a feature request?

Thanks,
Dino.

This must be possible because there a plug-in that let you do ajax

Yes, it is possible with the delete action, but not with the edit.

Hi all,

I'm looking for a good and stable plugin to add a star rating to each comment.
In other works I would like to use the comments as a review system to
allow users to insert a rate to their comment.

Some advice for me?

Thanks

FWIW the core WP answer to your question is the Settings API, which handles
page construction and a lot of the data processing for you:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API

It still involves some form creation so you will still be typing some < and
> to create form pages, but it streamlines the process for you and works
really well once you get going with it. If you decide to use an external
library the best practice would still be to use it with the Settings API for
your settings pages to keep your code as futureproof as possible.

And, looking back over the thread, I'm surprised that no one mentioned any
of the PHP ports of Zen Coding syntax.

I've used Phillip Walton's plugin (
http://philipwalton.com/2011/04/06/zen-coding-for-php-and-wordpress/ )
successfully to build lots of different kinds of repetitive markup
structures... it would work very nicely for settings forms.

Thanks for all the help.
The nested shortcodes are working like a charm.

Now I can use S3 signed urls in FV Wordpress Flowplayer plugin without a hitch.

I noticed that it seems to work equally well to either pass the
modified $content back to core or pass the results from
do_shortcode($content) back. Since the examples illustrated using the
do_shortcode call I stuck with that option.

Thanks again for the help.

Claude

Hi all,

after login this error is displayed:

What could be the cause?

Sounds like a plugin is calling get_page_link() before init has fired to me.

Disable all your plugins (by renaming the plugins folder via FTP) and
see if you can login then. If not, repeat it with your theme (rename
your themes folder). That'll get you into the backend, but you'll have
to work out which component the error is coming from, and get it
updated.

I'm assuming this is on WordPress 3.2? (possibly after just upgrading?)

Of course, the current installed version is the last stable and
available version (3.2.1).

I've forgotten to report that the error is displayed only when I visit
the admin area without typing "www" in the URL. Otherwise typing "www"
the error isn't displayed.

The very strange thing is that after login the user is redirected to
the URL without "www" instead being redirected to the correct website
URL (that includes "www").

For example:
the correct URL is http://www.sandbox.mywebsite.com but the user is
redirected to http://sandbox.mywebsite.com after login.
Visiting the first URL the error isn't displayed but visiting the
second URL the error is displayed.

Thanks

Sounds like you've got your Home/site url's set up incorrectly under
Settings -> General if it's redirecting to the wrong url..  If they're
correct and it still happens, check your plugin list like i said.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Detecting which action ran function
Message-ID: <4E453A61.7080704@gmail.com>

I have a function that is called from a number of different actions.

The function does essentially the same, except for one small difference 
on output depending which action triggered it.

How do you detect which WP action has called the function?

Thanks,
Rob

I guess it is not possible to determine which action called the
function. Anyways, don't you think it would be better to use an
additional parameter in your function to do the same thing?

I think you may want to look at the global $wp_current_filter which is 
set in the do_action() [1] function according to what action is being 
called.

Alternatively you could create wrapper functions for each action, and 
use them to pass a variable to your main function which would determine 
the output.

Hope that helps,

Jackson

The function you're looking for is current_filter().

As I suspected there has been a misunderstanding.

I'm not looking for a plugin to rate the comments, I'm looking for a
plugin that allows the users to rate a post when they post a comment.

Thanks

Ok, maybe I'll develop it and I'll publish it in WordPress official
directory.

Hello to the community!
Interesting idea about star rating system...
I have in mind that the back end of the plugin should provide user with an
option to choose style of a stars. U guess that jQuery on the front end
would be a cool option...

Certainly on the front-end to use jQuery is an excellent and reliable solution.

I will keep you informed (always posting in this thread) about plugin
development ;-)

Hi,

while a discussion i just have with some other dev, that Q came up: "*How 
would I check if some plugin already re-defines a pluggable function before 
overwriting a pluggable function with my own ... pluggable function*?". 

Note: pluggable.php loads *before* the 'plugins_loaded' hook.

Best wishes,
K.

Dirty workaround:
name your plugin dir & file zzz999-myplugin/zzz999plugin.php so it's
included hopefully last, and check if function_exists() to check if a
previously loaded plugin has the same pluggable function redefined.

Clean solution: can't think of any...

Thanks for your answer, Ozh. But sadly that's not a solution. The problem 
remains, as the "workaround" only tells me to give my plugin a higher 
priority (and overruling other plugins is not my intention). As I don't know 
of a real solution myself, I opened a trac ticket<http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18406>for further discussions.

Best wishes,
K.

Message-ID: <9865701.2320.1313372166077.JavaMail.geo-discussion-forums@yqaz21>

As to the description of the *%d type specifier* for *sprintf* in the php 
manual <http://php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php>, *%d* should be "*d - 
the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a (signed) decimal 
number.*". I run into the problem that using *$wpdb->update* along with the 
*$format* and *%d* removed all values behind the comma (or "ceiled" them?). 
It took me ages to find that problem and so I had to insert strings into *double 
*columns as a work around.

I wanted to open a ticket about that, but I couldn't really get behind the 
reason why this happens (and ran out of time). Is there anyone who knows 
what exactly is responsible for this behavior - as this is (imo) a bug?

Best wishes,

Quite simply, %d treats the value as a Integer. Integers in PHP do not
contain commas, 0-9 are the expected values. PHP's internal
String->Integer parsing code uses the first 0-9. segment of the number
as the final value.

Eg:
$in = '123,456.789';
printf('%d', $in); //123
var_dump( (int)$in ); //123

$in = '123456.789';
printf('%d', $in); //123456
var_dump( (int)$in ); //123456

The PHP documentation does indeed specify, that %d is a decimal.. but
that's just not the case.. It's an Integer.

PHP's closest thing to a Decimal is the Float data type:
$in = '123456.789'; // Note: commas will return 123 again.

printf('%f', $in); //123456.789000
var_dump( (float)$in ); //float 123456.789

the WPDB Class only specifies %s and %d as valid placeholders, but i
don't see any code which restricts it to that, so you might be able to
use %f to represent decimals (as floats, which remember, are less
accurate than a decimal)

the WPDB Docs that calls %d a decimal is infact, an integer.

FYI, I am in the process of developing a plugin as part of a larger project,
which will allow star rating on multiple aspects of an item (a post, a
place, an event, etc.).

For example, if you were rating for a restaurant, you might wish to rate it
for  taste, price, and atmosphere. Each could have a comment too.

Eventually, (second phase), we want to list averages, and counts at each
rating (like Amazon tells you 15 5-star, 6 4-star, 1 1-star)

Hi all,

I've found several plugins to add a mobile theme to WordPress, such as
WP Mobile Pack, MobilePress and so on.

Someone of us has already tried one of these plugins? In your opinion,
what's the best one? What are the differences between them?

Thanks

Message-ID: <CAEgmxaba78cS5qxgjpSFucvA1GvDG+dpRp=sp1NXE=b-qwLuVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Using custom post types for profiles of various types, I'm never sure how to
handle post titles as names, People could have any number of names, as well
as honourifics. It's trivial to just drop it in the title, but a list (or
archive) page, you may want them ordered by their last name. Has anyone
tackled this before?

There seems to directions. Either a) build custom fields for all the
individual parts and make the post title myself, or a) do something clever
with the post title to split into it's parts. Users may find the former to
be a bit clunky, and I can't think of a clever way to do the latter.

Example names might be:
Andy Apple
Dr Beverly Books
Mr Cricket, Esq

The simplest way would be to have a list of prefixes and suffexes on a "safe list" and process that first, then take the last group and assign it as surname and use the beginnings as given names. If there is only one then treat it as surname.

I've done this for faculty and alumni listings and found it best to make a
custom metabox with custom fields for the individual parts of names and use
those when doing a directory/archive while continuing to use the post title
and permalink as usual for ultimate control. It kind of depends on how much
control you really want to have and how specific/guided you need to get for
whoever is doing the creation/editing of the profiles, but for me and for
the users that ended up being the best route despite being a little more
work. Some people want to be listed with a middle initial without
punctuation but still be searchable by the whole thing, or somebody likes to
have their nickname in quotes, etc. Unless you know that your users are only
ever going to have one last name or one suffix or no middle names or no
punctuation (and there is no such thing as always knowing your users), you'd
be better off steering clear of trying to parse names. I'd bet that the
amount of time you'd spend trying to be clever would be way more than just
entering text into a few extra boxes :)

I had a very similar scenario to you and came up with this solution:

 - The post title consists of the member's name written in the standard
firstname surname way, minus the honourific.

 - I hook into the enter_title_here filter so the title input placeholder
text reads "Enter first name and surname here", just as a reminder for the
site editor.

 - There is a metabox on the post edit screen for the honourific, selected
from a dropdown.

 - A postmeta called alphaname is auto-generated from the title on the
save_post hook as follows:

  $names        = explode( ' ', trim( $_POST['post_title'] ) );
  $words         = count( $names );
  $alphaname = $names[$words-1] . ' ' . $names[0];

  Note: doesn't work for Cher or Madonna ;-)

 - The posts_join, posts_orderby and posts_where filters are used to sort
posts by the alphaname postmeta.

 - The honourific, if one exists, is output before the post title.

There are doubtless more elegant ways, but that has worked well for over a
year now with no mishaps on a site managed by non-teccie users.

Hope that helps

I suggest you use this basic plugin:
http://code.kuederle.com/browserbasedthemes together comes a theme for
mobile that you can personalize.

Besides that, there's the already famous WPTouch.

But if you want to personalize the theme yourself I suggest the first one!

Subject: [wp-hackers] Rebuild all rewrite rules
Message-ID: <CAMuGQivHd-QxNXPFnOLfhcPb1d=JuwELu7aAZ=c-O2CLTvygzQ@mail.gmail.com>

I believe that there are some conflicting and/or invalid rewrite rules (in
$wp_rewrite->rules) on my wordpress site. Is there any way I can force
wordpress to rebuild the rewrite rules?

Also, in a related matter, I would like to add a rule that routes /developer
to /tag/developer for my blog. I understand this is bad from a performance
POV but I still need to be able to do this for my readers (and boss). I
attempted to something like the following:

function tokblog_add_rewrite_rules( $wp_rewrite )
{
  $new_rules = array( 'developer(.+)$' => 'index.php?tag=developer' );

  //? Add the new rewrite rule into the top of the global rules array
  $wp_rewrite->rules = array_merge($new_rules, $wp_rewrite->rules);

  _log($wp_rewrite->rules);
}
add_action('generate_rewrite_rules', 'tokblog_add_rewrite_rules');

I'm not sure if this works because like I said before, I think there are
other conflicts in my rewrite rules.

Visit the Settings->Permalink page. It will rebuild the rewrite rules.

Are they really deleted, or in the trash?

oh wow, ur the man, otto!

any idea what i can do about the rewrite rule i'm trying to make?

I can see the rule getting added to the top of the array, but when i try to
navigate to myblog.com/developer it pulls up a post that happens to start
with developer as the first part of the pretty permanlink. in this case i
have my permalink structure set to "/%postname%". Yes, yes, poor
performance, I;m not happy with it either, but its part of the requirements.

Looks like a bad regex.  Try 'developer/?$'.  Then flush your rewrite
rules per Otto.

What about using .htaccess rewrite rules?

RewriteRule ^/etcetera/?$ /index.php?cat=1 [L,R=301]

RewriteRule ^/etcetera/?$ /category/etc/ [L,R=301]

Was trying to find a way for the URL to stay the same, but it's being 
modified by PHP, so it's a lost cause....

Mike's solution seems to work, but I'm going to up the ante on the challenge
some more. I also want the feeds for the developer tag to be available at
/developer/feed (and all the derivative formats normally as well). Can I
just add more rules? You can already tell I'm pretty bad with regex.

After a little more experimentation I think I got just what I am looking
for. Here's my code:

function tokblog_add_rewrite_rules( $wp_rewrite )
{
  // tag/([^/]+)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
  $new_rules = array( 'developer/?$' => 'index.php?tag=developer' ,
                      'developer/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$' =>
'index.php?tag=developer&feed='.$wp_rewrite->preg_index(1) ,
                      'developer/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$' =>
'index.php?tag=developer&feed='.$wp_rewrite->preg_index(1) );

  //? Add the new rewrite rules into the top of the global rules array
  $wp_rewrite->rules = array_merge($new_rules, $wp_rewrite->rules);

  _log($wp_rewrite->rules);
}

add_action('generate_rewrite_rules', 'tokblog_add_rewrite_rules');

Thanks again for your help guys

Hi Rafael,

thank you very much for your suggestion.
I've fastly looked the plugin you suggested me and it seems very
interesting, like the associated theme.

Thanks

Hi,

I get 404 page not found errors when clicking on my categories in a jobs theme I'm using. The original developer is AWOL on themeforest. What could possibly explain that the categories exist, but I get the 404 error? I just need a few pointers, so I can try to troubleshoot the issue.

It happens whether on the frontend or the backend.

I tried updating the permalinks structure. No change.

Thanks
ian

p.s., I did the following, to no avail: 

Deactivate Super Cache, switch to default permalinks, manually clear .htaccess, then reset permalinks and let WP write to .htaccess.

Okay, so the plugin WCS Custom Permalinks Hotfix fixes the issue, but it's pretty ugly (it reverts custom URLs in categories to the default permalinks structure, and they show up), and I'm running Wordpress 3.2.1, not 3.1.x, which the plugin was designed to use. Default permalinks works okay.

I have no plugins installed that should be interferring with the permalinks structure.

Is there a place in themes normally where permalinks would be defined?

Are there any posts in the categories? If there aren't you won't be 
able to visit the categories archive page. Mike

Figured it out. In my case, had to delete

flush_rewrite_rules();

From my theme's functions.php.
Now custom permalinks work.

(sorry for the bother!)

If you're doing that on every page load, then it will significantly
slow down your site.

Just flush the rules one time by visiting the Settings->Permalink page instead.

It was a bad setting in the theme, I think. So far as i know there is nothing wrong with WP 3.2.1 regarding categories. Deleting this line allows the custom categories to be found without need for the plugin I mentioned.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Wondering about this possible mod to core get_sidebar
Message-ID: <CACOUsBXD5A9uQwA=KXdUUW6U=pjzjJgHPMwiTPzstrQ-hdxkjw@mail.gmail.com>

Below is code I've been testing for a possible enhancement to the
get_sidebar core function.

Reason for mod: I wanted to pass in an array of declining alternatives
for the sidebar. This will take advantage of the power of
locate_template.

I'm pretty darn new to php, and very new to wordpress. Meaning, I
would not be surprised if there is a more bullet proof way to do this.

Even so, I wanted to run this idea by a few folks. To see if it is
worth trying to propose to the core guys.

Regards,
Claude Needham
p.s. A similar mod would be equally handy in get_footer

function get_sidebar( $name = null ) {
        do_action( 'get_sidebar', $name );

        $templates = array();
        if ( isset($name) ) {
                if (is_array($name)) {
                        foreach ( (array) $name as $disname ) {
                                if ( !$disname ) { continue; }
                                $templates[] = "sidebar-{$disname}.php";
                        }
                } else {
                        $templates[] = "sidebar-{$name}.php";

Message-ID: <004d01cc5dcf$81d6c050$0100a8c0@corpfe1f3cd943>

I have a working frontend form, for create post types.

Using as a template for pages: works nice, I'm able to create the post I get redirected to the them right after the process.

When I tried to implement this form as a plugin shortcode, I got "Headers alredy sent ". The post is created as well, but doesn't redirect to the post.

Also, is there someway to prevent going back in history and re-submit the form again? I know there's a lot of plugin for this, but that is a very simples static form.

We'd have to see what code you're using in the form to diagnose the "Headers
already sent" issue, but typically this is due to either `echo`ing content
too early in WP's execution or trying to modify the page headers too late in
WP's execution.

My guess is that you're trying to use some kind of HTTP redirect within the
content of the page ...

As for preventing the browser's back button ... don't.  It's bad form to
modify the behavior of the browser like that, and the user might have a
legitimate reason to use the back button.  Instead, just validate the form
to prevent duplicate submissions - i.e. use a nonce to detect whether or not
this is a repeat submission and reject the re-submission.

Thanks for reply Eric,

I will test some more and post the code soon. The most strange is if I add 
the form and form processing code after template calls (get_header, sidebars 
etc), I get the "headers already sent", (both for page templates or 
shortcode insertion). It seems something to do with template header itself.

The processing code should stay before all the html header, or not really 
necessary?! If so, that will be a lot of filterings for get the shortcode 
feature done.

Quite not sure if I should implemente this in my plugin...is an one time use 
form, a shortcode maybe aren't the best aproach for this isn't?!

At the point where WordPress is rendering/loading the shortcode (ie calling
your shortcode function), your website's header HTML has already been sent
to the browser.

If you want your form submission handling code to perform a HTTP redirect,
your form submission handling code will need to hook into something like the
'init' hook instead of being done inside the shortcode handler function.

So you have your form display/rendering code in the shortcode handler
function, and your form submission/handler code somewhere where it gets
executed before WordPress begins to output any HTML or HTTP headers.

Just a quick note, init would the absolute earliest you should perform
it, and in most cases, it's way too early (Other plugins init hooks
might not have been run, etc).
Generally, the template_redirect hook is the last hook run before the
template is output, and is a good generic "WordPress has loaded,
queried for the current page, and everything is set ready for output".
Init would be described as "WordPress has included all the files..
Time for plugins and other routines to start running.. After this,
we'll work  out the request that was made, query for the posts, do a
tonne of other things, and then consider outputting the template based
on what the plugins and internal routines have said"

Subject: [wp-hackers] get_post_meta returns empty meta_value
Message-ID: <CABWVAyWgrF96xQV=7d_W9YObYvLn55h0pjaSU18EVa67iRviDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Having a small problem with get_post_meta all of a sudden, and I hope
someone can help.

It's returning the meta_value empty, when it shouldn't. The post_id and
meta_key return correctly, so it finds the DB record.
I've grabbed the last_query and run it manually in the DB and it returns a
full result, so it "shouldn't" be a DB or query problem.

Quite frankly, I'm stumped. Anybody seen this before?

Jeff,
Is it possible there are multiple meta entries in the DB? For example, you can have two meta entries with the same key and the same value, and unless you tell the function to return all it will pick one.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Dynamic ajax tariff/price/services form ?
Message-ID: <1313739615.2906.6.camel@valio>

Hi , is there any plugins (or maybe some quick howto/examples) out, or
something to achieve something like this ? 

http://www.telnet.bg/index.php?mod=calc
http://arenanet.tv/connect.php

Basically i want to setup custom service/tarrif/price calculator , and
cannot find any quick solution.
I tried price-calc but  it so basic , so if i had to use it , i'll have
to rewrite it at all (i'm not familiar with ajax/js , im ok with php) ,
the plugin developer cannot provide any support at this tume ... so
thats not a solution. 

thanks in advance

Turned out the problem was with the presentation in NetBeans & xDebug. They
were showing (string) as the return, when in fact it was a serialized
string. I was expecting to see the content.

Very odd.

Thanks everybody!

I solved this, not sure if the right way but it works. The nounce thing 
still a mistery, but I will  refer that.

Now, the processing code only loads whenever the shortcode is used  using 
get_header filter for load that in right time.

Also, processing form and form codes are in separated files, that seems 
easier for when adding new fields and processing.

I'm having some issue on checkboxes for taxonomies, but that is for a next 
message soon!

Thanks again

Just a quick note, init would the absolute earliest you should perform
it, and in most cases, it's way too early (Other plugins init hooks
might not have been run, etc).
Generally, the template_redirect hook is the last hook run before the
template is output, and is a good generic "WordPress has loaded,
queried for the current page, and everything is set ready for output".
Init would be described as "WordPress has included all the files..
Time for plugins and other routines to start running.. After this,
we'll work  out the request that was made, query for the posts, do a
tonne of other things, and then consider outputting the template based
on what the plugins and internal routines have said"

Hi all,

I should create several websites. All of them are of the same
website-network and are hosted on the same host (in different folders).

Every website has a different domain, for example: domain1.com
domain2.comand so on

Can I use WordPress multisite to manage that network?

Thanks

So you hosted your websites on the same host but they have different

Yep! That's how multisite works: one WordPress install, multiple sites (at potentially multiple domains)

Hmmm, ok, I have an existing site at http://www.example.com, and a 
sister site at http://sistersite.example.com. Those two sites are 
running WordPress as a stand alone site. If I set up two brand new 
sister sites, for example at http://cousin.example.com and 
http://brother.example.com , would it be ok if just those two sites 
are using the multi-site functionality of WordPress? Or do I need to 
convert my two existing sites over to MU functionality as well? Mike

It would probably be easiest in the long term to turn example.com into multisite, and then move all of the subdomain sites to it. You'll want to back up fully beforehand, but the conversion process doesn't take too long:

On WordPress Multisite official guide is written that all the websites of
the network should be hosted in subfolders and reachable through a third
level domain, but reading the previous reply I realized that using that
plugin I could map every website in a different domain, right?

Hi Pasquale, WordPress does do this and it's actually every easy to do once you get over the technical part. I've avoided it for years but this week I bought a book from http://wpebooks.com/professional-domain-mapping/ and it was a snap. I'm sure the plugins suggested are just as good but from my own personal experience this guide made it very easy.

Chris

I'd agree. Specifically because your Apache configuration would be a bit 
weird.
Unless you want to setup a subdomain vhost for every subdomain you add, 
you'd end up having a wildcard subdomain vhost AND have two specific 
vhosts sending those existing sub-domains to different directories. I 
think that's quite possible but it would be off the beaten trail.

Your main decision about going MS or not will likely be how you want to 
control your users as all of your users will be stored in the same user 
pool.  So having a CodeNinja on site 1 means that name is reserved under 
all of the sites.  So a /different/ person can't have an account named 
CodeNinja on Site 2.  If that is fine with you, then you're probably 
fine using multisite for all of the sites.

Wojtek has been working on the Enhanced E-Mails project for GSoC 
<http://gsoc2011.wordpress.com/enhanced-emails/>.  As we near the end 
he's turned the project into a plugin available in the .org repo: 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/enhanced-emails/

We'd love to see this make it into core in the near future, but as usual 
we need testers.  Any help would be appreciated.

I'd like to chime in - it's a really exciting project, but since we have
released the last version recently, it wasn't tested as thoroughly as we'd
like it to be. There is probably a lot of polishing to do, but I'll be happy
to work on it as long as there is place for improvements. Now that GSoC is
almost over, I have scheduled part of my time for developing this project
further - any suggestions are highly welcome!

1. I noticed in the changelog for 0.2 one of the changes was "Removed
output buffering". I presume the first version of the plugin used
regular templates for the messages which were captured by an output
buffer. The current templates are much less user friendly as they have
to return the template in a string rather than just outputting markup.

What was the reason for switching away from output buffering? Was
there a performance issue? I ask because I would imagine if the
functionality of this plugin was rolled into core then themes should
be able to template the emails by including the email.php (and
email-foo-bar.php) templates just like regular theme templates. It
introduces inconsistency if the email templates have to return a
string instead of just outputting the markup. You've probably already
discussed all this, but this is my feedback anyway! :)

2. The documentation should mention what the templates need to be
named for each of the various email notifications used in WordPress (I
had to look at the source of each of the functions in the plugin's
pluggable.php to find out).

3. The template hierarchy appears to search for templates in this
order (using 'email-newuser-admin' as an example):

 * email-newuser-admin.php
 * email-newuser.php
 * email.php

It would be good if it also searched for email-admin.php before
searching for email.php, thus allowing a theme to simply define two
generic templates, email-user.php and email-admin.php (which may well
be styled completely differently as one is intended for admins and one
for users). Thoughts?

Thanks for the input!

As for output buffering, this is per westi's suggestions:


   - Personally, I think it would be better to try and avoid using output
   buffering to capture the content of the HTML version of the emails ? it
   should be fairly easy to switch over the way this works when we bring these
   into core.
   - In general output buffering is ?not a good idea? ? and we tend to avoid
   it. There aren?t specific pitfalls I can highlight here but I think it will
   probably end up easier to maintain and extend if it if function and string
   building based over output buffering.

If we decide that output buffering is the way to go, it shouldnt take too
much work to switch it back to the way it was. I'm not entirely sure which
one is better and I definitely liked the clean code of the 0.1 version.

@docs +1, I'm still working on the docs and some basic info for developers

@templates I have to think it through, your point is valid but I have to
consider if this doesn't cause some cross-template problems. I will get back
to it soon :)

cheers,
W.

Hello B2,

I believe that both examples use javascript to alter the price

You basically need to establish callback functions

For example on a radio button

<input name="numMen" type="radio" value="30"
onclick="Javascript:calculate_amounts();Javascript:calculate_mortgage()"/>

and setup the functions in javascript with the proper calls to your form's
elements


function calculate_amounts() {
var form = document.mortgage_calc_form;
  for (var i=0; i < document.mortgage_calc_form.tamLoteB.length; i++){
   if (document.mortgage_calc_form.tamLoteB[i].checked){
 form.total_property_value.value =
document.mortgage_calc_form.tamLoteB[i].value * form.precio50Enganche.value;
 }
}
 for (var i=0; i < form.enganche.length; i++){
   if (form.enganche[i].checked){
 if (form.enganche[i].value == 99) {
 form.masEnganche.disable=false;
 if(form.masEnganche.value<13 || form.masEnganche.value>90){
form.masEnganche.value=13;
 }
form.deposit.value = (form.masEnganche.value/100) *
form.total_property_value.value;
 }else{
form.masEnganche.disable=true;
form.deposit.value = form.enganche[i].value *
form.total_property_value.value;
 }
 }
 }
 for (var i=0; i < form.numMen.length; i++){
   if (form.numMen[i].checked){
form.duration.value = form.numMen[i].value;
 }
}
 form.loan.value = (form.total_property_value.value - form.deposit.value);
 }

my patch from #15448, correct? [1] [2]

Any ideas on whether this will be rolled into core? Westi mentioned
previously that multipart emails aren't supported, but if this is rolled
into core, I assume they will be.

Correct. Your patch helped me a lot and as far as I know, this will be
rolled into core along with Enhanced Emails.

Like Wojtkek, I'd like to make a call for the community to check out my 
GSoC plug-in, whose aim is to make sure that even though your connection 
is down, your posts aren't lost, using HTML5 localStorage.

The plugin can be found at 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/local-storage-back-up/
Hope you find it useful :)

That was done at Westi's request:

We will definitely need more documentation.  This will need to be both 
inline as well as in the codex since this is going into core.

Personally I think it makes more sense to work as similarly to 
get_template_part() and therefore locate_template() as possible.  I'd 
actually like to see it USE locate_template() but then it would need to 
be converted to find files outside the theme directories.  Still, it 
might make sense to make that possible (with proper checks).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using Modernizr for the new html5 input types
Message-ID: <CAP5iMo0FiTGXdofQs7-3tbTNwgaB8KRAdwhCxbpcxO_oirgkVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am using Modernizr to test for some new html5 input types (number and
range to be more specific) and i was wondering if it's possible to combine
this test with wp_register_script / wp_enqueue_script. I mean for browsers
that natively support this type of inputs, everything's fine but for the
older ones i don't want to manually include my libraries. Here's an example:

*Modernizr.load([*
*  {   *
*    test : Modernizr.inputtypes.number, // my test  *
*    nope : [spinbox_js,spinbox_css], // if no support, load my custom libs*
*    complete: function() { *
*    ** **jQuery('.html5-number').spinbox(); // do my thing ** *
*    }*
*  }*
*]);*

Wouldn't be great if in the "nope" method i could include my libs using
wp_register_script/wp_enqueue_script?

I'm not familiar with modernizr (although looking now, I think I might
start to use it!)

However, could you check the browser and version using
wp_check_browser_version() before you register and enqueue your
scripts?...

It would be nice, yes, but you're trying to do too much here.  Both
`wp_register_script()` and `wp_enqueue_script()` run on the server side ...
`Modernizr.load()` will fire the `nope` method on the client side ...

So, really, there's no way to do exactly what you're doing.  My
recommendation would be to use jQuery or another library to asynchrounously
fetch your libraries when the `nope` method fires.

Well yeah that's why i was trying to wrap my head around it for a while and
possibly find a solution but yeah i'm trying to get the most from 2
different worlds. I'll play a bit more with it though and come back with my
findings.

Don't you think though, that now with all those new HTML5 toys (css3, input
types, canvas) conditional resource loading would be great for WordPress?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Using Modernizr for the new html5 input types

I think this will do the trick: http://pastie.org/2412654

Warning, it's quick n dirty, but it works. It's basically just a function
which loops through the scripts and styles that have been enqueued and
echoes their URL's in a comma separated list, suitable for modernizr.

Simply define which scripts/styles you'd like by providing the function with
an array of their handles.

Subject: [wp-hackers]  wp-e-commerce problem
Message-ID: <32308971.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello, I'm new to wordpress. Trying to help out a friend who paid a web
developer to build a site using wordpress and a few plugins including
wp-e-commerce. Apparently he got in over his head and abandoned the project
while claiming he had done what was asked. That's not so much relevant to my
question except to say I'm trying to reverse engineer what was done and I'd
love to confirm what I think I'm seeing. The site is extremely slow and many
parts just seem to timeout or crash the server so that I have to reboot.

The site owner needs a great deal of variations to her products. At this
time only one product is entered to wp-e-commerce but it resulted in 4000
rows in the wp_posts table. wp_posts_meta has over 55k. When I stop using so
many variations, the site starts to function.

Can anyone help me understand why wp-e-commerce handles it this way? The way
I see it, they are forcing the product database into wp_posts and in order
to have a place to store variation inventory and variation pricing, a record
for every possible combination needs to be generated. Yet when loading the
product page, it only has to retrieve content from the original post. I
would've expected wp-e-commerce to store inventory and pricing in its own
tables and not fill wp_posts with 4000 copies of the same content.

Initially I was hoping there was just some configuration error now I'm not
so sure. 
If this really is the wp-e-commerce design do you think its feasible for me
to attempt to hook in some custom php which would avoid overload how the
plugin updates the database? I'm thinking if I stopped the admin functions
from duplicating the content in wp_posts and then added some wpsc tables to
handle the inventory and pricing. Then I'd have to add some filters to
substitute whatever variation data is needed into the final output. Does
this sound feasible? I'd appreciate any expert opinions before I head off in
a direction I may regret.

Thankyou and sorry this is such a long post.

Subject: [wp-hackers] what function creates the post slug?
Message-ID: <CAF_HY=pb1EE_T0Y8U2u=A849g8=FMHobXPmToHA5bcWYFczJvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys, quick question here...

i wanted to create a hook to change how WordPress creates slugs on a
specific custom post type that handles quite sensitive data.

I've just spent a few hours looking at rewrites and such but although the
information is pretty helpful, i just don't think rewriting the slug display
is the way to go, as it would be much safer to just have wp save a fixed md5
slug for that specific post type.

I imagine there's a simple sanitizing function that takes the post title and
transforms it, and then saves it to the db as slug, but i can't seem to find
it.

Any help?

thanks!

I'd be looking into the wp_insert_post_data filter in wp_insert_post()
and the "{$field_no_prefix}_save_pre" filter in sanitize_post_field()
function, however the latter provides no $context or post object for
reference, so you're probably better off filtering on the raw post
data..

Just found this http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14111 saying 3.3 will
have it's own unique post slug filter, so thanks, i believe this case is
closed.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Upgrading to wp_register_sidebar_widget Removes
	Current Widgets
Message-ID: <raf757dekb5v2ef2fons7k3ifp4al1go65@4ax.com>


Upgrading a theme to remove depreciated functions and using
wp_register_sidebar_widget to replace register_sidebar_widget
(depreciated) and the upgrade is removing the current widgets when I
upgrade sites running the theme.

Made a lot of changes to the themes code in the update but 100% sure
this is the cause of the issue. As a test replaced the code of one
widget, the 1st code snippet (old code) below to the 2nd code widget
(new code) or the 3rd code snippet (newer code)  below  (so two tests
with updated code) and the widget was removed from the sidebar which
confirms it must be the widget code upgrade.

The theme has widgets with code:

Old code

<?php
function st_Recent_Articles() { ?>
<span class="gat_widget"><?php _e('Recent Articles'); ?></span>
<ul>
<?php wp_get_archives('type=postbypost&limit=12'); ?>
</ul>
<?php } register_sidebar_widget(__('6GAT Recent Articles'),
'st_Recent_Articles');
?>

New code

<?php
function st_Recent_Articles() { ?>
<span class="gat_widget"><?php _e('Recent Articles'); ?></span>
<ul>
<?php wp_get_archives('type=postbypost&limit=12'); ?>
</ul>
<?php } wp_register_sidebar_widget('st_Recent_Articles','6GAT Recent
Articles','st_Recent_Articles');
?>

Newer code :-)

<?php function st_Recent_Articles() { ?>
<span class="gat_widget">Recent Articles</span>
<ul>
<?php wp_get_archives('type=postbypost&limit=12'); ?>
</ul>
<?php } wp_register_sidebar_widget(
'st_Recent_Articles',
'6GAT Recent Articles',
'st_Recent_Articles',
array(
'description' => 'Recent Articles'
)
);
?>

When the new themes code is uploaded all the themes custom widgets
that have been dragged and dropped to a sidebar are removed and have
to be readded. Widgets from plugins are unaffected.

The tests mentioned above confirms it much be this code change.

Would this be considered a bug or have I got my code wrong for the
update?

Thanks.

David

While 3.3 isn't here, though, i got into Dion's wp_insert_post_data filter
suggestion and got this to work:

*function rm_martins_cpt_permalink_change($data, $postarr) {*
* *
* if ($data['post_type'] == 'post_type_name') {*
*
*
*                $time = time();*
* $data['post_name'] = md5($time);*
* return $data;*
* } else {*
*            return $data;*
*        }*
*}*
*add_filter('wp_insert_post_data','rm_martins_cpt_permalink_change',10,2);*

this solution was partly borrowed from a function in wp-includes\ms.php
(line 590 or so) that checks for colliding permalinks over a blog network,
pretty neat.

It just replaces the original post slug with the md5 hash for the unix
timestamp of the last post data insertion, which seems random enough for me
and i hope won't cause me trouble when listing posts in the future.

So, just thought it might be useful to post my result function here, though
it has not been thoroughly tested so far.

thanks for the help!

Message-ID: <CAL1O-KVT7b9j0vrkFgzE7WDJWmiZoU2ZN8aUyOVPT0dtxdpbsQ@mail.gmail.com>

 Personnel, single page I want to display the post and a box with the other
posts in the same category. I can do this, but in this box, I want to
display only six posts in the same category and include paging, there starts
the problem because it ap

pears on page single method get_query_var('paged') always returns 0.

My query_posts this way:

query_posts ('posts_per_page = 6 & cat = 34 & paged ='. get_query_var
('paged'));

Always display the first 6 posts in category 34, when I click on the
Pagination she goes to the address with final / page / 2 but then is
redirected to the address of the post, not keeping the / page / 2 in the
url. Query_post a Test like this:

query_posts ('posts_per_page = 6 & cat = 34 & paged = 2'));

and thus works, it shows the next six posts, but how to make this happen
dynamically?

Could anyone give me a light?

For secondary queries it's better to use "get_posts" instead of 
"query_posts", query_posts is for the main query that's passed from the 
URL and will modify that one.

There is a query variable "numberposts" available for get_posts, since 
passing posts_per_page as a variable doesn't work......

I'd say perhaps the best way to achieve that is using a WP_Query object
instead of query_posts for your secondary loops.

See this ->
http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/1753/when-should-you-use-wp-query-vs-query-posts-vs-get-posts

i've done a fair bit of secondary loops inside one single page, often using
different page templates and it works wonders for me.

Get_posts WP_query and tested with and did not work for the same reason, is
always paged = 0 because the get_query_var ('paged') only returns 0.

Subject: [wp-hackers] A/B testing of posts with unique URLs for each variant
 & editing in custom fields
Message-ID: <CADuZyg9QYsL_mfJL2i3+R=Gvs0Lc481gxUY=sQEdwtMq_SmQng@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wondering if anyone could offer advice on how to think about creating an
A/B testing plugin for *posts *that *Req. A)* lets me assign unique URLs for
each variant post* and *Req. B)* is customizable on the frontend (i.e.
new-post.php). There seems to be *two *ways I could go about doing this:

*1. The first way*: Create three separate posts, use the Shrimptest plugin
to test, and exclude two of the posts from single.php (This was basically
the answer<http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/26362/creating-unique-post-urls-for-a-b-testing-is-this-even-possible>that
Otto gave when I asked about it on Stackexchange. The
*problem *with this solution, though, is that I would have to go into the
files to edit the code every time I want to test a different batch of posts.
And I can't figure out a way for it to meet requirement B.)

*2. The alternate way*: Create custom fields in new-post.php that would give
an editor the option to write in alternate headlines and upload different
Facebook images and FB text. This is my preferred option right now since
everything would be customizable from new-post.php. The *problem *is that
I'm not sure how to meet requirement A (a unique URL for each variant I
test). Is it even possible to create a custom field in new-post.php that
assigns sub-URLs on top of the default URL?
Any tips or suggestions on any part of the problems I described would be
great! Thanks in advance!

*Note: The reason I need requirement A (unique URLs for each variant) is
because I ultimately want to measure shareability of my posts on social
networks. For example, if I launch a post with Headline A, FB picture B upon
sharing, and FB text B upon sharing, I want the number of clicks on that
A/B/B variation to be tracked. Thus I need to assign a unique URL to that
variation.

Hi,

I think perhaps you should try the forums over at getshopped.org (
http://getshopped.org/forums/) for this, as it seems WP E-Commerce related.

If your friend has a paid subscription to WP E-Commerce you can try the
premium support over there as well.

Good luck and hope it helps.

Its my impression from searching google is that getshopped won't address this
issue but you're right I should post over there anyway and give that forum a
chance to help rather than assuming those accusations are true.

No paid subscription.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Upgrading to wp_register_sidebar_widget Removes
	Current Widgets
In-Reply-To: <raf757dekb5v2ef2fons7k3ifp4al1go65@4ax.com>
References: <raf757dekb5v2ef2fons7k3ifp4al1go65@4ax.com>
Message-ID: <hhm9571jia7akodcnqpm7guke47vk99qrc@4ax.com>

Figured out how to upgrade without stripping the widgets.

The old code used a derivative of the name of the widget as the widget
id.

Old code

<?php
function st_Recent_Articles() { ?>
<span class="gat_widget"><?php _e('Recent Articles'); ?></span>
<ul>
<?php wp_get_archives('type=postbypost&limit=12'); ?>
</ul>
<?php } register_sidebar_widget(__('6GAT Recent Articles'),
'st_Recent_Articles');
?>

New code

<?php function st_Recent_Articles() { ?>
<span class="gat_widget">Recent Articles</span>
<ul>
<?php wp_get_archives('type=postbypost&limit=12'); ?>
</ul>
<?php } wp_register_sidebar_widget(
'6gat-recent-articles',
'6GAT Recent Articles',
'st_Recent_Articles',
array(
'description' => 'Recent Articles'
)
);
?>

Only change from the ID for the new widget is the name of the widget
"6GAT Recent Articles" with the spaces replaced by hyphens and
lowercased "6gat-recent-articles".

Hours of research (didn't find anything online about this) and it was
starring me straight in the face from the sidebars_widgets option in
the database :-)

Cleanest solution would be to use an mu-plugin, as they load before all
normal plugins. You could make your whole plugin an mu-plugin or have a
special one that just handles this particular task ahead of time. Obviously
it won't solve the problem if *another* mu plugin already defined the
function, but that seems a lot less likely than a regular plugin.

This is probably not a good solution for a publicly released plugins as it
involves hand-uploading files but for a custom installation an mu-plugin
isn't a huge burden (and for custom scenarios they have many uses once you
learn how to exploit their power).

Isn't it somewhere on the roadmap to completely get rid of pluggable funcs 
as they are implemented now?
I'm not sure I've ever found them actually worth the hassle they can 
otherwise induce...

Is there a reason their need can't be removed by good use of hooks and

Message-ID: <CACDr4ieOJK46ja_mqxekPieMs3w5Y30pm9XK3vKcu07KRnrdLw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a multisite install with a single-sign on integration that only
works if the redirect destination from the sso server is the top-level
url.  i.e. sending the browser to https://example.com/wp-login.php
works but not https://site.example.com/wp-login.php.

I ended up customizing wp_validate_redirect() to allow redirects to
subdomains in a multisite install (see below).  Is there any interest
in merging this into trunk?  I can imagine this wouldn't appeal to
those who don't trust the sites they host, so perhaps checking a
config option would be appropriate.

Why exactly is this? Is it a cookie thing? Because if that's the case,
maybe just setting the COOKIE_DOMAIN would work regardless of where
the login is.

Regardless, wp_validate_redirect is a pluggable function. You don't
have to edit the core code to modify it, just define the function
elsewhere, like in a plugin, and your version will replace the one in
the core.

Hey all,
Apologies if this has been discussed before, but what's considered best practices for orphaning a plugin I no longer intend to work on or support? Should I remove it from the plugin directory, or leave it up with a notice?

Thanks,

No. WordPress doesn't use the crypt function to do md5 code. There's a
couple of uses of it in the PHPass library, but those are used for
Blowfish or DES encryption, not md5.

We don't like people removing code from the directory, but if the
plugin doesn't work anymore then we'd be willing to close it so that
it doesn't appear anymore.

I'd say leave it up and maybe add a notice to the readme for people to see.

You can also attach something to the allowed_redirect_hosts filter.
It doesn't have to add all your subdomains: just the one you're
redirecting to at the moment.

The original solution involved defining a customized version of
wp_validate_redirect(), but it was an 80% copy/paste.  I didn't
understand the allowed_redirect_hosts.  That works, and it's cleaner.
I can pull the redirect_to param out of the request, run some checks,
and add the hostname into the list.

Thanks for the help!

Hi all,

I would move a website from a folder (initially called "beta") into another
folder.

In theory this operation is very simple in post and page contents there are
a lot of images with the old path and I would avoid manually editing all
posts and pages replacing the old path with the new one.

Someone of you has some suggestion for me?

Thanks

Do you have access to PHPMyAdmin? If you're on a Mac, there's a neat equivalent program: http://www.sequelpro.com/

Basically, what you'll want to do is connect directly to your database, and run SQL statements to find and replace the URL references.

Here are a few I commonly use:

UPDATE wp_posts SET post_content = replace(post_content, 'http://domain.com/beta/', 'http://domain.com/anotherfolder/');
UPDATE wp_posts SET guid = replace(guid, 'http://domain.com/beta/', 'http://domain.com/anotherfolder/');
UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_value = replace(meta_value, 'http://domain.com/beta/', 'http://domain.com/anotherfolder/');
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = replace(option_value, 'http://domain.com/beta/', 'http://domain.com/anotherfolder/');

Obviously, you'd want to replace "domain.com" to whatever your domain is, and use the proper table names.

Hope this helps,

Daniel

Someone will probably correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly sure
this is all handled by the WordPress export and import system, so it
might be easiest to use that. When you import a WordPress XML file
it'll replace all instances of the domain name you're exporting from
with the domain name you're exporting to.

Message-ID: <4E581B7E.30207@braydon.com>

I've noticed on one server I'm working with must have the apache module 
mod_pagespeed installed because static files are being appended with 
stuff like this at the end of files|".pagespeed.ce.xo4He3_gYf.jpg"|

Found this article about it:
http://codesamplez.com/web-server/mod_pagespeed-htaccess-tutorial

Going to look to find a way to turn this off when developing because 
it's not picking up changes I am making during development.

Anyone have experience with this? and know if there are any plugins in 
WordPress that would do something similar, but would be more accurate on 
knowing when files are changed. Shaddy Z., has been working on a PHP 
framework, SteamFW, that does static file fingerprinting with and md5 of 
the file and a cache of it's fingerprint: 
http://code.google.com/p/steam-fw/source/browse/trunk/libraries/Steam/StaticResource.php#34 
Good idea, bad idea?

Subject: [wp-hackers] APC-Nginx-Apache problems / memory problems on VPS
Message-ID: <09FA6D9D-AA5F-469D-A74A-9C552C26D53D@powerfoundation.org>

Hi,

I'm on a Level 3 HostGator VPS: 1.13Ghz / 768MB RAM / 30GB HD / 500GB bandwidth.

I have a site that usually serves 4000 pages a day.

I just renewed my Wordpress site with a new theme (commerically available from a reputable company, so I'm pretty confident of the code) and some extra plugins for functionality. Before renewing, sometimes I'd get database connection errors on the shared account I was on. Eventually, I had to move to the VPS because the site was deemed to be pulling too many server resources.

I was being suspended.

So we did the move. Then the trouble really started.

Even with 768MB RAM, I can't keep the site up. HostGator admins at first said I should disable plugins (I hate this kind of response; it is avoidance. The plugins are there for essential functionality; the question is how to get the install I want to work). In reality, there are only a few plugins that actually add to what is rendered on the main page. So far as I can see, there's nothing there that should be a massive resource hog. And there's nothing that I haven't used without problems before in a shared hosting environment.

In an effort to minimise the load on the server I did the following:

1. Activated W3 Total Cache and a good number of its options
2. Established an account with CloudFlare and changed the DNS so I'm using their caching / CDN system
3. Configured APC to take the load off php
4. Configured Nginx to work as a reverse proxy on the server

This combination, at least according to some, is about state of the art when it comes to performance Wordpress sites. 

But after configuring both Apache and Nginx, and getting both processes restarted, the site doesn't work. Apparently Nginx drops connections to clients.

Both httpd and nginx daemons are running fine and the config check for both yields "Success" or "OK" output!.

Apache's port is set to 81 and it is the stock Apache that comes with CPanel.
Nginx is taking over port 80

The site is not working even if you connect to http://mysite.com:81

Using Easyapache to rebuild the httpd server did not positively affect the situation.

Here are the Config Check Outputs:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

root at server [/usr/local/nginx/sbin]# apachectl configtest

Does anyone have any experience of getting APC, Nginx, Apache, Cloudflare and W3 Total Cache to play together on a VPS?

The site has been down now two days. I'm desperate to troubleshoot this to get it back.

Would really appreciate some help.

Have you tried SuperCache and .htaccess rules to go past any PHP?

The plugins are there for essential functionality; the question is how to get the install I want to work). In reality, there are only a few plugins that actually add to what is rendered on the main page. So far as I can see, there's nothing there that should be a massive resource hog. And there's nothing that I haven't used without problems before in a shared hosting environment.

Thanks Braydon, but at this stage I'm focused on getting the setup I mentioned to work. Apache+Nginx has a good reputation for VPS, and I want to get it to work because my site needs major scalability, and Nginx in particular can provide that.

ian

Hello,

I never used Apache+Nginx together, but you may want to take a look at
litespeed, it faster than having apache and mod_php working.

Hope this helps.

Thanks

I don't understand why you need to use Nginx and Apache together unless 
you're using multiple servers and need a load balancer.....

Thanks Daniel, and Braydon.

I spent quite a lot of time investigating the best solution for my particular needs, and I'm are convinced that the Apache+Nginx combination is the best for these needs. I also spent some time to get everything installed and working. All I need at this point is a hint as to where the glitch might be.

best,
ian

I'm currently using Nginx reverse proxing to Apache w/ mod_php and
mod_dav_svn (This is why i'm using apache)

Due to the way Nginx caching works, You'll probably want to add a few
headers from apache to control the caching.. I'm using this WordPress
plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nginx-proxy-cache-integrator/and
almost the same configuration file as is in it's installation page..
So
far i'm not having any problems with nginx.

Your problem sounds like Apache is crashing to me.. or your nginx
configuration is wrong(Nginx shouldn't drop connections, it will however
display a Gateway Timeout in the event Apache doesnt respond when it's
fetching a non-cached page). I'd want to check your Keepalive settings, and
your number of Apache workers, and see where you can go from there.

Another thought that comes to mind, is How is your Memory footprint going?
Is Apache using a lot of memory (APC is going to increase it a fair bit
IIRC) - Do you have some kind of watchdog process running which kills hungry
processes? How often are those Apache workers being recycled - Is a module
having a memory leak and therefor, the process needs to serve fewer
connections before a new one being created?

Ultimately, You're going to need to dig deep and work out where your problem
is coming from.. Enable logging for Nginx and apache, and monitor them, Are
you seeing droped connection in the nginx logs? What about in the Apache
logs? What about non-200 responses in the nginx logs? Since you're using
Cloudflare, I believe they act as yet another in-between proxy? Are the
dropped connections coming from their end rather than yours?

Finally, I'd stop using W3 cache if you're going to use Nginx proxying,
Unless you have a lot of logged in users on the site, the Object Caching
functionality of it is going to be wasted memory (IMO) and you have no need
to do static file caching in WordPress if Nginx is configured properly..
 You might just have too many layers of caching, and as a result, too many
layers where problems might arrise?

Ian,
The place I would definitely start is finding where the bottlenecks are in your code so you can see where you need to improve performance. 

What's the theme you're running? (It doesn't matter if it's from a reputable company, it might still not scale.) How many and what plugins are you running? How many users do you have? How many posts do you have? How many pages do you have?

Your best hosting solution depends enormously on all these things and more. Run SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST; on your mysql db to see if there are queries that are hanging up. 

My point here is that the hosting you outlined sounds more than adequate, so you probably just need to tweak things.

Excuse me if some of this is redundant, without seeing your exact set
up it's difficult to diagnose what's at fault.

Firstly, when you say you can't keep the site up do you mean? You
can't get the stack configured in the first place? Or does it fail
quickly. If it's failing, how much free memory do you have? What do
your system, apache, nginx logs say?

You mention cpanel, are you using a VPS with cpanel installed? If
you're going to the extent of reconfiguring apache and installing
nginx do you need cpanel? It's been a while since I've used it but it
brings a lot of services you might not need. Plus the auto updates can
kill your customisations.

Why are you proxying to apache? You need an apache mod? If you don't
need that mod for your wordpress site why not run apache on it's own
port/ip and have your wordpress install served directly through nginx?
It'll simplify the set up and there're lots of guides out there for a
straight nginx/wordpress setup.

A shame that your host won't work with you, but instead against you.

Broadly speaking this is what I hear about *every* host on all, even
vaguely, hosting related email lists and groups when someone asks got host
recommendations. I recommend a VPS with a community (just like WordPress
has!). But I won't voice anything here in case I spawn another distracting
fight!

This implies that the site *is* up, if not continually.

This implies the site is down, completely.

The site is not working even if you connect to http://mysite.com:81


Is this 'just' firewall issues? And hence completely separate? I know it's a
pain, but redacting your domain name *may* make mailing list replies rather
vague. Have you considered paying a sysadmin to log onto your server and fix
it?

What does work? Apache on it's own? Nginx on it's own? Static files?
WordPress, for a bit then the server hangs? Everything, but not when the
caching plugins are activated? How is MySQL faring? Is it delivering a lot
of expensive, uncached queries?

This sort of investigation and configuration is at a level where using
cpanel on a VPS is probably pointless, unless you are a hosting reseller or
want a bunch of other things out-of-the-box.

(Reading over this, I may come across as a little aggressive, I really don't
mean to, not sure how to re-word it. I feel your frustration, but it sounds
like your tinkering on the edge of your current skill set and can't quite
ask the right question yet. Have you got the time and energy to start again?
For $20 you could spin up another VPS and play with that instead of testing
things out on a live domain - I can recommend a VPS with 7 day money back
guarantee and an active irc channel)

We recently had problems on a dedicated server running CPanel, with half a gig of RAM. It was going down regularly with memory full issues, even though it only had one WordPress multisite install with about 10 sites, nothing major at that point.

Turns out that the recent updates to CPanel mean that it needs 1 gig of RAM to run and not cause the server to fall over, so you might want to follow up this CPanel lead.

Best...Dan

I would also turn on mysql's slow-query log to see if there are any crazy
queries going on. In fact, log all queries. The fact that the original
problem involved database connection issues hints at a mysql angle. A few
bad queries can tank a server.

4,000 pages a day, is just not that much.
Then also look at server memory usage.

Ian,

Regardless of where the theme came from, I would start there. Switch the theme to twentyeleven for an hour and measure the performance, if the problem goes away it's the theme. If not, start deactivating plugins until you find it. The WordPress core shouldn't consume that level of power, even at 4,000 hits an hour.

If that doesn't work, look at offloading your RSS feeds (http://thisismyurl.com/blog/2010/09/10/offload-or-cache-your-wordpress-feed-for-maximum-performance/) and in a worse case situation, cache the entire site without a plugin (http://thisismyurl.com/blog/2011/08/08/ultimate-wordpress-caching-method/). That last step is pretty extreme but it will allow almost unlimited traffic without server load.

The plugins are there for essential functionality; the question is how to get the install I want to work). In reality, there are only a few plugins that actually add to what is rendered on the main page. So far as I can see, there's nothing there that should be a massive resource hog. And there's nothing that I haven't used without problems before in a shared hosting environment.

You *shouldn't* have had to, if:

1) All images were *attached* to the posts, rather than linked, and
2) You enable the checkbox to download/attach all attachments on import

That's exactly what I did Chip, but everytime there have been a few images
that I've had to alter manually.

If you're directly transferring the whole site to a fresh install, what
about exporting the db, running a find/replace, and importing that to your
new database, takes care of all old references in posts, options, media.

Many thanks to everyone who replied. The pointers given have been very useful.

At first we were getting RAM maxing out and crashing issues. Then we had difficulty getting online at all. 

Two things became clear:

1. CloudFlare was not playing well with Nginx and we had to disable it and even reset the DNS entries. We kept getting 502 Gateway Errors. However, this may have been due to the issue we encountered today.

2. Cpanel: chkservd scripts kept resetting the Apache port to 80. This basically kills Nginx, which ought to work on port 80.

We went to:  WHM -> Service Configuration -> Service Manager and unchecked HTTPD from the monitor column. Still it got reset.
We edited the  /etc/chkserv.d/chkservd.conf  and added "httpd:0"  Still it got reset.

We had to have HostGator admin chattr the chksrvd configuration file, forcing Apache to maintain it's port 8081 configuration.

Currently, we're recompiling. Next we will try to figure out what is going on that is taxing the CPU / RAM so much. 

I seriously don't think it's a plugin. I'm not really using anything that I haven't used on a shared environment. And although there are 51 plugins currently active, only about 8 add content to pages. A good deal of the others are benign, like Show ID for the backend or Favicon My Blog. The only plugin I imagine that may put stress on the server is Disqus. I have a couple of Twitter plugins, but would these crash a 768MB VPS? I also have three flash banners on the main page, each around 800k. Big deal, right?

Other stats: 9000 posts, 600 users, but only a handful active. Maybe 10 comments a day right now.

The base theme is WP-Prosper by Solostream. I love their themes. Very clean and precise. WP-Prosper was released 2010. It's WP3+ compatible.


QUESTION: 

I want to get the most efficient Wordpress install possible. Not just as a gimick, or to waste my own time, but for my end users, to ensure super fast access, and to get an install that allows our project serious growth in the period ahead.

Dion suggested that using Nginx makes W3TC redundant. Meanwhile, I read online various different views on the optimal use of applications / plugins like Nginx, APC, CloudFlare, Eaccelerator, W3TC, and Varnish.

Google CDN is also just around the corner.

What do people think is the optimal use of such applications / plugins?

At present I have Apache as a backend, and Nginx as a front end. I had to lose CloudFlare for now, but would like to look into Varnish, and possibly reimplementing CloudFlare (it has other features I think that are neat). Eaccelerator is also an option, via my VPS host.

Dion suggested that too many layers of caching could be a problem. I have not the technical knowledge of how these apps interact and differentiate to assess this.

What is the view of others?

I know some (perhaps many) will say, keep it simple, and I agree. But I'm asking about lightning fast, optimal installs. In particular with large scalability in mind, and run off a fairly modest VPS.

If anyone has suggestions for optimal use, please do share.

Thanks,
ian

Hi Ian,

Have you considered moving your hosting business to either ZippyKid or WPEngine.  Both are WordPress specialist hosts that focus on running high performance sites.  I believe they might be able help resolve your issues if you move your site to them and probably for no more than you are paying for VPS.  FWIW.

-Mike
P.S. 51 plugins?  Really?

Thanks Mike.

Actually, both of those hosting companies are significantly (almost twice) more expensive than HostGator for what they provide. I'm basically trying to reach the same functionality and scalability by customising the VPS.

I agree they'd probably have better support for memory issues than HostGator!

This indicates, I think, that there's a real problem somewhere. 146KB and 27 seconds?

Yes, please, Tom.

HostGator is continuing to avoid the problem completely. Today, we asked again for technical support to narrow down our issue. Their sole response to a whole page of explanation from us was that we should have upgraded not to Level 4 from Level, but to Level 6 or even Level 7 (i.e., from $50 per month to $129 or $160 per month: from 1.9GHz and 1.3GB RAM to 4.2GHz and 3GB of RAM).

ABSURD.

We need to think about alternatives for an emergency migration.

Cheers,
ian

As some maybe see from another thread, I'm in a middle of a nightmarish situation trying to get a site to work on a VPS.

I'm checking as many things as I can understand right now.

In debug mode, I get this hundreds of times:


Notice: get_settings is deprecated since version 2.1! Use get_option() instead. in /home/bikyaweb/public_html/wp-includes/functions.php on line 3382


What is it, and how can I get rid of it?
Is it important to get rid of this?

Well, looks like your wp-includes/functions.php was modified in some 
way. Or maybe, it just didn't get updated, when you updated your WP?

*Not this at all.* The core reporting functions just show where the notice
is thrown from, not the line of code which called it. You should really use
a plugin such as Debug Bar and Log Deprecated Notices to know where such
items are coming from.

Back to the original question, It's usually Themes which use get_settings()
(I believe this is simply due to the number of theming tutorials out there
which reference it), Plugins in general are a bit more with the times.

Ian, I've encountered similar problems with our VPS hosting. It was a long (two weeks is long when your production server is crashing daily) and painfull process. I cant provide you with a silver bullet, but the following things contributed to resolving my issues:

1.	Split your webserver and MSQL into two servers. (even if it's a temporary move) This gives you a sanity check about where the problem lies. If webserver keeps crashing and databasee server is nice an cool, you know for sure it's a code/config thing.

2.	Check database performance. One of my developers wrote a plugin to analyze slow database queries from within WP. joeboydston.com/downloads/slow-queries.zip The plugin itself adds quite a bit of load/ovehead, so use it in debug mode.

3.	Based on what you learn from steps 1 & 2, you may find like I did that some of the plugins you're using may not be scaling for you:

> google-sitemap-generator
> yet-another-related-posts-plugin

Both of these plugins caused excess load on my server and had to be dropped.

Thank you Joe,

I'm beginning to think there is some kind of limitation in VPS environments. We go from one fatal error to another. It's incredible. Right now we have 502 Bad Gateways, and sometimes 504 Gateway Time-outs. If anything it works at all we have load times of maybe a minute.

I'll try to follow your steps.

I thought a decent VPS would simply work. Even we disable all plugins and it doesn't work.

And as for the plugins, people chime in that there are too many. Yes, if you're running a blog. We're trying to use Wordpress as a CMS to run a fully fledged news site. If we don't have plugins, we don't have functionality. Again, 1.3GB of RAM should handle functionality, no?

I think we have a memory leak somewhere. If someone can explain to me what those are like, and how to track them, I'd appreciate it.

We're look into the debug log. I get hundreds (like may 700 on the frontpage alone) of the following:

Notice: get_settings is deprecated since version 2.1! Use get_option() instead. in/home/bikyaweb/public_html/wp-includes/functions.php on line 3382

I wish I could even just solve this. There are hundreds of these that must also stress the CPU.


Sigh,
ian

Do you have a test or staging environment set up? If not you should
set one up (including the Cloudflare DNS and Nginx reverse proxy) and
see if you can reproduce the problem with a site that's not under
load. If your VPS is struggling then you'll probably need to do this
on a separate server. Once you do this it'll become clear whether the
problem lies with the site structure, or whether it lies with the
site/server when it's under load.

The advantage this gives you is you can also incrementally remove
things (eg. Cloudflare or W3TC) to find the problem.

In theory, the number of plugins you run is irrelevant, but the
quality and efficiency of those you run is. You could run one terrible
plugin and kill your whole site, or you could run fifty well built
plugins and have no adverse affects (and of course they could actually
speed the site up).

In reality, running fifty plugins on a site *is* likely to cause
problems purely on a probability basis. You're probably running at
least one plugin which is less than optimal in terms of memory use,
database queries, etc.

One resource-intensive plugin might not hurt, but three or four that
eat up memory will soon cause you a problem.

> I think we have a memory leak somewhere. If someone can explain to me what those are like, and how to track them, I'd appreciate it.

If you had a memory leak it should disappear when you disable all your
plugins (unless it's caused by your theme). A memory leak will rear
itself in the form of 'Out of memory' errors in PHP's error log.

xhprof or xdebug are both very good for profiling PHP. I've lost many
an hour going through the swathes of information that xhprof provides,
but if you have a major problem it should be fairly clear fairly
quickly.

You should adjust your PHP error logging level so notices aren't
logged (although I know there is a PHP bug regarding suppressing
notices with certain error logging levels, can't remember what at the
moment).

Thank you, John

> Do you have a test or staging environment set up?

We're migrating now to another host, to see if the site will run from a different server.
The guy who is helping me a linux administrator and he cannot see why the server is going down.

I just don't understand it either. This exact same installation worked fine in a shared environment for two weeks (albeit it hit the resource ceiling a couple of times, which was pretty low, being a shared hosting account). When we moved to the VPS, things went nuts.

It's about time Wordpress.org made a black list of known resource hog plugins. I read something about this on a community blog somewhere; maybe WPMU. At the same time, I'm fairly picky when it comes to plugins, and I do research before I install and try to get the best and most recent and up to date plugin for a given need.

I'm also surprised that there are no available tools for really finding what is pulling the Wordpress install (and CPU down). I mean, the CPU is trying to serve a particular need, or a particular plugin is pulling in RAM or leaking it. Surely it should be something we can know, as humans, if the computer knows, because it's happening to it!

I will look there. We did notice that with all the plugins installed, if we changed to TwentyEleven read time dropped from 19 seconds to 9 seconds. The theme we're wanting to use is WP-Prosper from www.solostream.com 

They seem a very reputable company to us. They have gotten industry awards for their themes. It will suck big time if it's a theme problem, because we already spent four weeks building our site around that theme.

But one useful thing I learn: Just because it works on MAMP, doesn't mean it will work on a real server.

I meant more that the number of errors seems to indicate that this error is throughout the theme / installation. I was wondering, indeed, if curing this alone would bring some health back to the server.

The problem is that I really have no idea at all about how to cure it.

Thanks again for your reply.

You can replace "get_settings" with "get_option" in your theme's 
functions.php or your plugins. However 700 calls on one page doesn't 
sound right. Have you tried switching to 2010 or 2011 to see if your 
theme is the culprit?

As others here have mentioned it would be a lot better if you had a test 
install (with exactly the same setup/data) where you can do all debugging.

I don't understand. Switching to 2010 or 2011?
I'm definately interested in eliminating the theme, if possible.

Andrew means the default theme that ships with WordPress, which is
called TwentyEleven (and last year's was called TwentyTen).

Ah. Yes, we tried that, and load time certainly was reduced, but it didn't solve the CPU / load averages issue, or RAM maxing out. It helped, but it didn't cure.

And anyway, we can't use that theme for our news site.

But certainly, the theme needs to be look at, I think.

ian

If you don't mind me asking, what is the magnitude of your site's revenue base.  Is it essentially break even, or does it make 10x hosting cost, 100x, 1000x?  IOW, what's the cost of being down?

We're a news site, so being down is more critical than perhaps for other sites.

In terms of revenues, it is negligible. We can't cover costs, if this is what you're asking. We have been builiding on volunteers. But we got to a certain prominence because of the Egyptian revoltution, and we want to continue and to expand. We redesigned the site in order to better attract and keep readers, and we need it stable and robust so we can attract advertisers and run plugins like Ad-Rotate.

Our traffic is about 600,000 pages served per month.

best,
ian

Hey Ian,

I'm coming in late to the thread, so some of this may have been 
mentioned before. By themselves, there's not an issue with VPS servers 
and hosting WordPress.  However, being virtual, VPS servers can do some 
things that you won't likely see in physical environment.  For example 
VPSs can be very defensive about the resource limits.  They want all 
VPSs on that machine to run well.  To help ensure that, they can do 
things like going out and shutting down services that are taking up 
resources.  (It's amazing how much halting apache can reduce the load on 
a webserver. ) So just be aware of this if you are nearing the  limits 
of your VPS. If you are seeing services restarted constantly or just 
disappearing, this could be the cause. If you are not exceeding the 
limits of your purchased server, your system should run fine.

Did any one suggest using something like this to find the plugin that 
uses a get_settings call?

find /home/bikyaweb/public_html/wp-content/ -name "*.php" -type f|xargs 
grep get_settings

That will help eliminate all of the errors being written to the log.  
Really you want to eliminate every write action you can from when a page 
is being viewed.
So look at the plugins that are related to page loads.  Tracking plugins 
are notorious for this because they write information to your database. 
People sometimes load many different metrics plugins and then are 
surprised that their site slows down as it is writing the same 
information out to the database a half dozen times in addition to what 
is already recorded in the Apache log.  Also plugins that cause searches 
for information upon page load can cause issues. That's why YARP was 
mentioned by someone else as a possible issue.  With a large site, 
there's a lot of work to find any and all posts related to the one being 
displayed.

Based upon their names alone and not looking at any plugin's code, I'd 
look into these:

	social-metrics
	top-contributors
	wordpress-popular-posts
	yet-another-related-posts-plugin

And see if disabling one/all has any affect on your site's performance.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents worth of advice.

Just found and replace wont work because of the serialized arrays:

1. Export your local DB
2. Upload your files to online FTP
3. Import your DB online
4. Upload this script to the root of your WP installation
http://interconnectit.com/124/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/
5. Run this search and replace script (
http://www.domain.com/searchreplaceDB.php)
6. Check if you have permissions to write on your root (.htaccess)
6. Log in your wp-admin
7. Resave (regenerate) your permalinks
8. Test your site, must be working properly

I do this all the times, an it's perfect.

ps.: Looks like they have updated the searchreplace script, haven't tested
it yet.

Hi,

I currently in the process of creating a theme for a client, I'm quite

would register a menu space in the functions.php is it possible to
assign specific menus per page?

Or is there maybe a plugin which could help me out on this?

I use the Genesis framework. With Genesis, you can have different layouts,
menus and sidebars on every page.

Check out the 'menu_location' parameter in the wp_nav_menu function:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_nav_menu

In your theme, just define the various locations and then use that in
the backend.

I'm not an expert on server troubleshooting, although I'm good at
troubleshooting in general.

I would think setting up a server on a virtual machine where you could set
different limits on memory, disk space, etc, would be a useful tool for
troubleshooting this sort of problem.  I would set up a linux server
personally, but that's because I use Linux normally.

But with a server in a VM, you could reduce memory in stages, until you have
problems, and do the same for disk space.  Then see if you can replicate the
same problems.  You would then at least know what the limits are.

But if it only happens under heavy user load, I'm not sure how to test that.

There are lots of tools for this ? ab, httperf, etc. So long as you've got enough clients to throw requests at your server, you can test pretty much unlimited amounts of load (though if you're talking only of a few or even a few hundred requests per second, then a single desktop PC over an ethernet connection will easily suffice).

Ian, I'm also running news websites, which reminds me... you aren't by chance running openX to server your ads on that same server are you? Your symptoms sound very similar to my early experiences.

Moving openX to a separate server was the single best thing we ever did. openX absolutely kills the database and memory on your server.

Hi Joe,

No, we don't have OpenX. Actually, I had not heard of it until now : /
Looks neat though. We need something like that, if not that, eventually.

Hi, I have solved this problem using Hyper Cache Extended (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache-extended/ ). Yes I'm
the author of this plugin and the reason for writing is all the
problems you already have. And Hyper Cache Extended solves them.

What is the biggest botteneck with WordPress and why are there so many 
different caching plugins? Can this not all be abstracted through one 
API and work across many different hosting solutions from economy shared 
hosting to fully dedicated all the way to multiple server configurations?

That because not all caching plugins are created are not the same. Some are
better written than others and some only deal with some aras.

The most ideal situation:
Caching repeated independent elements as static html, widgets, post 
summaries, post details, post comments, all as separate, and each with 
their own URIs that can easily be invalidated. These can either be 
cached in memory or on disk and accessed via PHP or from Nginx or 
Apache. This way JavaScript can act as a template engine, repeated 
elements are not sent across the wire for every page, and the server 
doesn't need to do any work generating full html pages. For 
JavaScriptless access, a sitemap can be generated that would lead to all 
posts, comments, pages....

And that's the way many of the cache plugins works. But that
complicates the situation and only one mistake make the plugin to work
worst than clean wordpress installations without any cache plugin

The biggest problem I've found is the interoperability between other 
plugins and caching plugins, since caching isn't part of the core. This 
is especially true for any plugins that deal with templates or post 
types or plugins that use their own database tables. That is to say 
caching isn't a part of the core other than the transient API, right? 
But that works with the database still if not using the memcache plugin, 
and the database is usually always the biggest bottleneck, when static 
file would be better when memcache isn't available.

In my experience 80% of the load comes from php, not by MySQL.

An aside: related posts is an essential functionality for keeping readers onsite. Is there a related posts plugin that is better than others like it; alternately, is there one to really avoid?

I'm interested in people's experience, because related posts is a functionality I can't really forego.

Yes, there is a way to keep the functionality and avoid heavy database
queries, but I haven't seen plugin written this way.
The right way to do this is to use posts words dictionary and to query
this dictionary. NOT to do /select like %% queries/.

Now how hard would it be to hack a plugin to work like that?

I think it isn't hard. It's just different query from different mysql table.
Instead of querying wp_posts we have to query wp_term_taxonomy.

Before we get to that shouldn't we look at the server setup? No point
hacking the plug-in if the server configuration is not right.

Also, it seems that this conversation has strayed rather far from 
hacking WordPress to improve the core. It is likely starting to bother 
some.  Maybe it could continue as an email discussion among those who 
have significantly participated so far.

Bear in mind that VPS problems are not always down to the setup of your
individual VPS - they can be significantly influenced by the virtualisation
technology itself, especially if the host company hasn't configured it well
or is overselling (which most of the big companies do). Different
virtualisation technologies handle high load scenarios very differently. My
best VPS experience by a mile is with a company here in the UK who use KVM
for virtualisation and who do not oversell.

I'm running a site with YARPP on a small (1gb) VPS that it shares with five
other WordPress sites, in total getting more daily hits than you do, but
I've rarely seen server load go up above 0.2. Most of the time in fact it's
around 0.02, so I don't think YARPP is your main problem. I'm sure it
probably could be more efficient, but you've got other problems to tackle
first.

On a sidenote (but more in line with this list's subject of hacking
WordPress), I became somewhat obsesssed with reducing database queries,
especially on the homepage, and one strategy I've adopted is to use
transients to store the HTML output of various bits of the homepage, such as
all the custom loops (there are 8 loops on the homepage). These transients
are updated on save_post and set to be stored indefinitely, so visits to the
homepage create zero extra database calls outside of the main loop (because
the queries are run in the admin, not on the front end if you see what I
mean). Without this, the homepage was generating something like 200 database
queries, now it's just 20.

Simon

PS - I find Server Density (http://serverdensity.com ) a very useful and
cheap service for monitoring all kinds of things: server load, MySQL, disks,
I/O, CPU, memory, processes, swap, etc. Very easy to set up and works with
Nginx too.

It certainly can do query and table caching, but some default installations
do not have those things turned on.

Message-ID: <CAHBjUcROuvkqno2B5ZTk25PRpj7AfJqq+jV86Pc1u8m9rfwF8g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wondering if anybody can think of a quick and easy solution for
this typical situation:

you have set everything up for the client who wants to manage himself
the content of a new WP website. You thought him not to copy-paste
directly from MS Word, and you told him to upload images at a
reasonable size.

Your WP theme has been configured to resize all images appropriately,
so there is nothing to worry ... except that the customer will upload
10 MB images from his camera, at sizes of 5000 x 3000 px ... and WP
won't produce any thumbnails for those, as the resizing exceeds the
memory limit.

Question: can we define a maximum pixel width (of, say 2000px in any
direction) beyond which the user will simply get a warning message?

Setting an upload limit in MB for any uploads wouldn't be a solution,
since we still want to allow the upload of a 15 MB pdf, for instance.

Have you considered suggesting the client use a Flickr account or similar for their image uploads and then use the API or a plugin (if one exists) to grab the photos for use on the site?  Flickr will do all the image resizing and only costs US$25/year for unlimited space.

plupload allows for this, you specify the maximum height/width in pixels and
the image gets resized on the client side before upload:

I just pushed the "1.0" of my GSoC project, WP Document Revisions into the
.org repo, but wanted to take a quick second and thank everyone for the
invaluable feedback over the course of the summer.

If you're interested, a brief overview of some of the high-level features,
as well as a screencast of a typical use case can be found at:

Thanks for the opportunity and looking forward to contributing back again
soon,

Also, plupload is integrated into WordPress 3.3 and offers the option
to resize during upload, at whatever the "large" size is set to.

Is there some way using the built in wp-ajax-response script/wpAjaxResponse 
to send XML Elements that share the same name? Or is there any other 
recommended way than going with JSON? In some cases this isn't possible 
(external APIs providing only XML as response for example).

Ian,

Running Apache / Nginx / MySQL all on one box with 768MB of RAM is - in 
my experiences - not a good idea. You will constantly run into 
performance issues simply because that amount of RAM can only handle so 
much MySQL processing before MySQL starts to choke.

Thanks all of you for your input!

@Mike: using Flickr would complexify the process both for the client
and for the theme author. In my case, the theme is displaying image
attachments automagically at a defined size, so the user only has to
attach images to the post. I want to keep it that simple for the user.

@Simon: I will check out the WPlupload plugin. "Resizing on
client-side" - sounds brilliant, I didn't know that there is a way to
achieve this in the browser. That's actually way more than I was
asking for :)

@Otto: that's great news, one less plugin needed!

It only depends on database size. If there is enough free RAM, so the
database can fit in it there will be no problem.

As detailed in other threads, I've been facing a string of problems with a website. Now it seems there is database corruption. We get the following error numerous times:

1. Does anyone know what this error is?
2. Is there an easy fix, or do people have recommendations as to how to fix this?
2. If not, is there anyone out there capable of repairing this MySQL database error manually?

Although I'm doubtless there are people on the hackers list who can
help with this, a more appropriate place to ask would be a MySQL forum
or one of the Stack Exchange sites on SQL/MySQL.

Ian,

That's not an error message, it's (part of) the command line used to start
the mysql daemon. That fact that you don't know that, and that you assume
database corruption, coupled with your previous threads make me think you
are seriously in over your head here.

You have received lots of good and helpful advice and pointers from many
people: your responses sometimes indicate you don't understand or know what
to do with that advice. I would recommend you get some (paid) external
help.

Hi Mike,

In reality, I'm on the graphic design side, not a developer. But I'm on this list because I'm trying to learn more about Wordpress, which I've been playing with for a couple of years. It is true that I've been getting great advice from this list, and it's true that some of it I don't know what to do with. But I get pointers for things to try to explore. I'm trying to learn, but it's true I find the detail difficult sometimes.

Happily, I'm not the primary tech guy for our project. A friend who deals with servers has been helping me on and off. He told me there was corruption in the MySQL database and gave me this output. I just passed it along in my question in case anyone knew anything. But I'll pass your message back to him. I guess he doesn't have too much experience in MySQL.

I'm glad to hear it's not an error.

Forgive us these stumbling beginnings ?. It's true we need specialised help, actually in several directions.

best wishes,
ian

The fact that there are "numerous" suggests mysql is crashing and
restarting. What distro are we talking? Look for error logs, including the
one referenced in the start up string. Some distros might throw mysql errors
into syslog (I think Ubuntu does that). Syslog might have a wealth of
information.

You probably need somebody with decent Linux sysadmin skills to check the
entire server set up.

Not mine that's for sure. I wouldn't be interested in server management
work. I have my hands full doing WordPress development as well as managing
my own servers (all dedicated, not VPS - I personally couldn't be bothered
with managing VPSs: been there, done that, moved on)

I understand that, but all of your issues sound like OS/Apache/nginx/mysql
issues not WordPress; especially as the site worked on shared hosting in the
same configuration.

Here's a simple thing to check - how many apache threads/processes are
allowed? I have seen a dedicated server with 8 cores and 8 GB of RAM fall
over because Apache had too many threads allowed. *Reducing* the number of
threads stopped the problem.

The reason I ask, is that on shared hosting that number is most likely
restricted for you, so your site could never overwhelm Apache. On your VPS,
you may well be using the default (150 in some installations) which could be
way too much.

There might still be an error (especially if Apache threads are dying from
lack of RAM) Just that that text is not an error message.

Thanks Mike. I appreciate it. Point taken. I should find other lists to post questions about Apache/Nginx/MySQL etc.

Hi everybody,

Small problem and I can't get the server to load the correct certs per domain.

Current sert up

WordPress Multisite set up with sub directories. 

With 3 sites set up under it.

main site -http://www.eckerd.org/
sub site - http://www.eckerdacademy.org/
sub site - http://www.eckerdcbc.org/

Then we have http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/ set up to map the other domains to the main site and sub sites.

The SSL works just fine on the main site.
When you try to go to a sub site (https)
It loads the main sites Cert. 

We have 3 different ssl certs set up with the 3 main domains.
 
How would we get the server to load the correct cert per site?

People have said if you use different IP's it can be done, But that's really all they say - No real Direction or more info then that ; c (

James,

Each SSL certificate *requires* a unique IP address on the server. This is
outside the realm of WordPress configuration. The solution will depend on
your network and server setup.

As a general overview, you'll need multiple public IP addresses (3) pointing
to your server and your web server should be configured to respond to each
IP with the proper domain and SSL cert location.

And if you're wondering why this is it's because an SSL connection is
negotiated before the request is read, so the server cannot know the
hostname being requested until the SSL connection is made. Therefore
you can only have one SSL virtualhost per IP address.

Message-ID: <CAPtWN+zp0fwUhCBQiRhNtd5uy3iPu4ztYTtp86FBFG2QwCEePg@mail.gmail.com>

Just curious if anyone has experience with storing associative arrays with
hundreds of elements as a transient. The site in question uses persistent
caching and memcached.

I'm looking to build a time-sensitive hit counter that keeps a rolling two
week count. The site has over 4,000 video pages. My initial thought is to
create a transient for each day that expires after two weeks. This daily
transient would contain an associative array such as video_ID => hits   A
cron job would run twice per day to index the top 20 videos for a "What's
Popular Now" widget as well as other uses throughout the site.

The client doesn't want to create an extra table to track hits.

Any thoughts or suggestions on performance going this route? This is a large
site I'm planning on using Mark Jaquith's TLC Transient framework.
https://gist.github.com/1149945/d262805fc3498f7b705e5c2e6437775a3ad4b4a8

Thanks for the input.

Just remember that transients aren't guaranteed, not when you're using
memcached. Your data could be lost if the memcache is cleared or
restarted or what have you. Memory based cacheing is lightning fast,
but impermanent.

A hit counter in postmeta might make more sense. Not as fast, but
instead of a cron job, the list of top 20 could be as simple as a
posts query. Of course, if this is a large traffic site (in hits, not
in bandwidth), that could also bring it down. Need more information.

Not entirely true. Apache after 2.2.12 supports SNI (Server Name
Indication) which allows for multiple SSL certs per IP.

Even if the client doesn't want to store it in a separate table, it's 
going to be worthwhile, since you can use the table for other kinds of 
logging and the persistence issue Otto mentions.

I started a plugin for event logging to track JavaScript events and 
things otherwise not seen in the Apache logs, it would be great to have 
things work for even situations such as this too, which could be helped 
out by having a post_id column in addition to a unique event name....

And prior to this, Apache would indeed always serve the first 
certificate associated with that  IP address.

So the real restriction was 1 certificate for IP address, and not that 
you couldn't serve multiple vhosts securely.  So there was a work around 
if you were tricky.

You could create/purchase a certificate with each domain and the 
wildcard for the domain (example.com *.example.com example2.com 
*.example2.com), and thus you would always serve the valid certificate.

I can issue signed Class 2 certificates, and was able to get this to 
test this and got it work with a fair number of domains on the single 
certificate.  Apache would throw up warnings at restart (that it 
wouldn't be serving the configured certificates), but they could just be 
ignored.  If it serves the one certificate, and it's the right one, 
that's all you need.

That said, you'd probably be better off with multiple IP addresses or 
SNI. It's not cost effective for most people to purchase certificates in 
that fashion, so this "feature" isn't often used. And any little known 
feature may evaporate due through disuse. (Though if anyone did want to 
try this for fun, and or money is the driving factor, you could always 
become a StartSSL.com Verified partner and issue the certificates 
yourself upon demand).

Otto,

It's a massive enterprise site that gets tens of thousands if not hundreds
of thousands (at times) of visitors per day. I was thinking the fail-safe
would be to store the indexed videos in an option that is available even if
the cache is cleared. The client wants some semblance of popularity
representation, and doesn't need to be completely relevant real-time. I
could also see adding an extra post meta field to each video with the latest
hit count. The cron job could purge all of these hits on the next run and
replenish the new set of videos with the popularity meta. This whole process
is to identify 20-30 videos across the site.

Thanks for your input on this.

Brian

Thank for all the help guys, could not have done it with out you ;c )

If you force the domain to IP mapping on the server it allowed the certificates to work properly.

Problem fixed.

Care to document the exact steps you took somewhere?  I'm sure this will
come up again in the future as more of us attempt to enable SSL on shared
systems/multisite.  Maybe on your blog or somewhere in the Codex?

Subject: [wp-hackers] meta query crashing database
Message-ID: <CAGEuVU2JvbVoBjvBGch4OLdLx7yN4hM-OGxfEiGVwWGnmEGXWQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to build a query. I have a CPT, "campaigns", which is
related to one or more "issues" (also a CPT).

The relationship is managed by a custom meta box on the campaigns edit
screen, you select the issues. It stores one or more entries in the
postmeta table, each having the ID of the issue.

What I need to do is, for the single campaign template, grab a list of
"related" campaigns. So I need to grab all other campaigns that are
related to any of the issues that the campaign being viewed is related
to. The dump of the WP_Query arguments, for campaign ID 851, with a
bunch of related issues, is this:

Array
(
    [post_type] => campaign
    [posts_per_page] => -1
    [post__not_in] => Array
        (
            [0] => 851
        )
    [meta_query] => Array
        (
            [relation] => OR
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 185
                )
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 194
                )
            [2] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 193
                )
            [3] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 187
                )
            [4] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 191
                )
            [5] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 189
                )
            [6] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 186
                )
            [7] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 190
                )
            [8] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 188
                )
            [9] => Array
                (
                    [key] => _slt_issues
                    [value] => 192
                )
        )
)

This crashes the database in quite a severe way, and I've bothered my
sysadmin for a reboot one too many times now experimenting with it!

Can anyone see anything obviously wrong? There's only ten or so
campaigns in the system, and about the same amount of issues. Is it
just the number of parts to the meta_query? Is it related to the fact
that _slt_issues may have multiple entires in the postmeta table for
the same campaign? Is there any feasible way of doing this query?

Many thanks for any thoughts,

Steve Taylor

You'd probably do better with the MySQL IN operator, since each meta
query is a join (an expensive MySQL operation).

$query['meta_query'] = array(
 array(
   'key'=>'slt_issues',
   'value'=>array(112,113,114,115,115),
   'compare'=>'IN'
 )
);

Also, watching Chip's video on theme development (submitting to
wordpress.org), having comments as no-questions-asked REQUIRED element
would seem to imply that edit_posts is a REQUIRED capability for themes.

And finally, looking through wp-admin/includes/menu.php and
the custom_menu_order filters, removing posts and comments from the admin
menu doesn't appear to be encouraged.

Over all, it seems my approach is not very 'WordPress'. I will re-visit
this later.

Thanks for listening.

We've now forced them to have that feature (with its new name), even if they 
previously disabled it, right?

(I'm not being obtuse, I just know that many a client is going to ask why 
something they've disabled has reappeared)

Not as such, The Toolbar in the WordPress admin is now used for more
than what it was in 3.2, In 3.2 it duplicated things, in 3.3, as part
of the aim to simplify, the toolbar was chosen as the right place to
insert the header stuff, so thats where it now resides.

As a result, we've gotten rid of the small header, and moved to a more
consistent UI IMO.

There's the possibility for a plugin to completely disable it, and add
an alternative menu somewhere in the UI that holds the things you can
only find in the toolbar though..

custom fields to the *new user* form, so there's not really a good way to
make that happen in the way I've done it in the past.

Does anyone else have a way to add fields and save user meta info when
creating a new user?

a term under the "audience" taxonomy.
and that term_id "102" which is "youth" is another term under the
"audience" taxonomy.

Here is the main question;

What happens if I do NOT use the "register_taxonomy" function that
registers the "audience" taxonomy at all whatsoever  AND I programmatically
add records to the "wp_term_relationships" table associating some post ids
with the term_taxonomy_id's 101 and 102 which are the term_taxonomy_id's
that are associated with the "audience" taxonomy. Again, no
register_taxonomy function ever been hooked before, now and after.

Would the posts still be pulled and WordPress will still continue to work?

To me, it appears like the register_taxonomy function will be needed only
to make the admin ui so that it can display the "audience" as a taxonomy
and whether to show it as "tag-like" or "cat-like".

Is that true? Or does the register_taxonomy function is needed for other
purposes too?

And why wasn't WordPress code & db structure implemented in a way so that
the arguments passed within the register_taxonomy function ( such as
rewrite_url or hierarchical TRUE/FALSE etc ) are stored in some database
table?

Is this because the core development do not want to change the existing
database structure so we *have to* live with it?
Or is it better to keep such information this way anyway for certain
reasons.

'm unable to see the benefits in this and this lack of understanding
effects me in getting hang of the inner workings of this beautiful CMS.

need to feature items 2 3 years back.

In order to feature such posts, I simply categorized them into the
`featured` category and once I am done featuring them, I unchecked
them from the `featured` cat so I can have the room to feature new
ones.

This approach has multiple drawbacks.

Firstly, I cannot simply go pick a post and then categorize it under
`featured` and expect it to be appear on my `featured` zone!. I MUST
UNCHECK AT LEAST ONE OF THE EXISTING FEATURED POSTS. Why? Well, if I
got room to display 5 featured items, and I happen to just feature a
6th one. which 5 is to show in there?

Secondly, due to the unchecking, I can never build an archive of 'once
featured' or 'at least once featured' list of posts.

It seems to me that WordPress make a one heck of an assumption that
featured posts come from the latest posts! So, As you bring new posts
in it, you can simply keep on checking them into the `featured` posts,
and WP will nicely show them in your `featured items zone` in the
chronological order. This obviously kicks the 6th one out of the view,
keeping the latest 5 in the zone.

But, what if you pick one old post (from say 3 mts ago && you want
that to appear in that very same zone? Change the post date?

Let me quickly note here that the Sticky posts feature of WP won't
help here neither, cause they too require the maintenance of
'unsticking'. Sticks posts may help with the situation for one Zs and
two Zs but if you constantly feature items from the past, it won't
help at all.

I wish there was a special category, called FEATURED with an option to
change the base name  whereby WP manages the featured items using a a
different date based criteria.

So, Everytime an item is checked into that special `featured` WP
category, WP  keeps track of the date of this action into a database
field, called `last featured date` or something like that and when it
displays the items in the `featured` cat ( and all of its sub cats ),
it simply sort posts  using that date - instead of the post_created
date!

My question to you is that if there are slick solutions out there to
address this problem?

the same record to be inserted multiple times.

To remedy the situation, I've tried 3 different techniques including
the use of custom fields, but no luck. I also tried inserting a unique
key into the post itself to minimize the database activity. I found
this is better cause it avoids the involvement of custom fields, and
yet achieves the same goal. I put the source_key ( which is something
like --{$db_name}.{$table_name}.{$recid_value}-- ) in the post and
at_insert_time , I just check the existence of that key ( using like
operator ) to see if that post was added previously. but even that
fails... Wp_insert_post surprisingly creates double records. and up
until now, I simply cannot pin-down the occurrence of the problem.

I read this, Prevent duplicate posts in wp_insert_post using custom
fields But my techniques were simply alternatives to it.

Here is a cut-down code of how I do it...

while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($RS)) :

        $source_recid = $row['source_recid'];
        //source_recid is something like db.table.tablerecid
            //example services.media.1223

        $post_data['post_content'] = $row['some_field_thats_got_page_content'];

        //append the source_recid to the post data in forms of an html
comment for uniqueness purposes
        $post_data['post_content'] = $post_data['post_content'] .
"<!--{$source_recid}-->";

        //do the other stuff... ( shortened here for the clarify purposes... )

        ....

        $post_data['post_status'] = 'publish';

        Insert_or_UpdatePost($dbh,$post_data,$source_recid,$post_id);


        if ($post_id==0):

            //log the error and move on

            continue;

        endif;


endwhile;

function Insert_or_UpdatePost($dbh,$post_data,$source_recid,&$post_id){

        // this function first looks up the --db.table.tablerecid-- sequence
        // across all wp_posts post_content field
        // in determining if this record has been already INSERTed!

        // and depending on the outcome, it does an insert or update
        // and return the $post_id accordingly

        // if the function determines there are no such records,
        // then and only then, it runs the wp_insert_post!

        // if the function determines that there is a post like that,
        // it retrieves the post_id
        // and then switches to operation
        // to use the wp_update_post instead!

        // with this approach, technically speaking,
        // it should impossible to run wp_insert_post on an existing post!

        // and yet, I still get duplicate posts...

        // here we go;

"It is possible to replace this class with your own
by setting the $wpdb global variable in wp-content/db.php
file to your class. The wpdb class will still be included,
so you can extend it or simply use your own."

When one implements a db class that does not extend wpdb, it would be
safer that the new class implements an interface. This interface may be
called wpdb_compat and would assure that the class has all necessary
methods/properties. Of course, wpdb_compat should be supported by wpdb
too.

[Design Strategies]

My patch adds:
* wp-includes/interfaces/wpdb-compat.php

Very small edits to:
* wp-includes/wp-db.php
* wp-includes/load.php
* wp-admin/install.php

At the moment, WordPress does not include any interface; this means that
there is not a directory for interfaces.
In my first draft, I put it in wp-includes/interfaces so that - if more
interfaces will be added in the future - they will have a logical place.

[patch]

I have a patch which works correctly, but it seems that I can not post it
in Your Trac. How can I submit my patch to Your attention?

up when the file is loaded (compile-time) as PHP doesn't know if it's
going to be declared or not until it's run (run-time). So, the opcodes
can be cached, but the symbol table can't be loaded from cache until the
function is run.
