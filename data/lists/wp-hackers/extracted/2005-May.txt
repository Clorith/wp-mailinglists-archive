I  believe the issue here is that too many hosts forbid the outgoing 
connection to grab the last-updated times. CURL is somewhat more universally 
allowed, but some hosts still require the user to manually configure CURL 
for their proxy. I went through this nightmare with GoDaddy and never got it 
resolved.

Hi All,

I'm new to Wordpress and don't know the general development proceedures you
all use yet.

I have created a complete Blosxom import tool (i.e. like import-mt.php,
import-rss.php, etc).  Should I post the file here, use Mosquito, ...?

Thanks,

There are a couple of issues with the Pingomatic API:

1) The number of sites that ping it is still small compared to some of
the older blog trackers.

2) It only recognizes sites in the "http://domainname.tld" format. If
a link in your list is in the "http://www.domainname.tld" format, the
API will not recognize it.

Could you confirm this, I'm pretty sure I fixed this bug Friday.

Message-ID: <000001c54f1f$0bdab430$6702a8c0@DB>

I find the WordPress dashboard disturbingly polluted lately.

As a WordPress user, I expect the dashboard to cover WordPress and blogging
news. May I suggest to limit Planet WordPress feeds to those specific to
WordPress or Blogging, e.g. like Owen's WordPress categories, rather than
entire blog feeds? Alternatively, it would be nice if users could customize
the feeds in the dashboard without hacking their WordPress install.

Additionally, I'd like to highlight that John's blogging pro feed is no
longer in the Planet. It was one of the more relevant feeds when it came to
covering WordPress and blogging news, so I presume this is just a mistake.

Lastly, it would be nice if there was an email or a submit feed form on
Planet WordPress. It would make sense to add the WordPress and/or Blogging
feeds of all WordPress theme and plugin developpers to the Planet.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Mailman-style Blog Archiving 
Message-ID: <4276328A.8030301@skippy.net>

This post has had me thinking for some time:
   http://photomatt.net/2005/04/27/wordpress-direction/

At first I railed against the idea of retiring a mailing list in favor
of a blog discussion.  A blog discussion of fifty or so messages is far
less useful than the same fifty replies on a mailing list.

Some complaints I have:
* Blog discussions have a flat hierarchy: everything is in response to
one top-level post.
* Blog comment permalinks are inseperable from their parent post.
* pingbacks and trackbacks are (IMHO) inelegant means for participation
in a conversation.

But careful consideration helped me realize what specifically it was
about a mailing list that I found so valuable: archives.

I keep local copies of all mailing list messages I receive, stored in
IMAP folders by list, so that I can review any individual thread,
regardless of whether I'm online or offline.  I often include links to
mailing list archive permalinks when referencing an old(er) post, and I
find it extremely useful to know that I can link directly to just that
one post, instead of an entire thread.

Mailing list archives allow each post to have a unique page view, and
provide navigation controls for next-by-date and (usually) next-by-thread.

If WordPress would support a "?c=X" query string variable to load a
single comment, and then display that comment in a single view without
the entire discussion, AND provide navigation links for next-by-date and
next-by-thread, AND include links to the post's permalink and this
specific comment's permalink in the post (to quickly provide links to
full context), I think I could live with a blog discussion instead of a
mailing list.

Archive links could then be of the form
   http://example.com/archive/post/ID
   http://example.com/archive/comment/ID
for post-only and comment-only permalinks respectively; and an overview
could be made similar to the display at:
   http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-May/thread.html
This kind of archive display, I think, is more useful in a long-running
discussion because it lets you see each element individually (which
drastically improves load times), thereby making it easier (IMHO) to
reference specific comments.

I was going to try to write a plugin to accomplish this, but I simply
don't have the time.  So I'm sharing this idea here, in the hopes that
someone can run with it.

One of the biggest shortcomings with this methodology, though, is the
use of exceprts for trackbacks, and the complete lack of any content in
pingbacks.  In order to provide a coherent view of the conversation in
one archive display, full-post *backs would be necessary.  If an
"archive" view requires me to go visit some other site(s) to read bits
of the conversation, I most likely won't participate.
(Alternately, someone could implement transclusion to silently include
the remote ping data into the comment stream...)

Hi, 
Have you tried xdashboard plugin?

It's not the perfect solution but maybe just a good place to start from

Planned for a future version, it was just hardcoded in 1.5 to give 
people a taste.

It'll be back in when he turns on full feeds.

Eventually it'll run reblog or feedwordpress or something to enable 
content from any blog talking about WordPress, not just the devs.

The are all things I'd hope we could address before implementing this. :)

Bingo! And think if people could do the same sort of search you do 
without having to have been subscribed to the list forever.

I think it would be even more useful if it could show the current post 
as well as the context on one page, instead of having to go back and forth.

I agree full caching would be necessary, also because we don't want the 
discussion to fragment if someone's blog goes down.

I see value in both seperately.

We already have "full context" in comment anchors on a single post
permalink.  But as the discussion continues, linking to comment anchors
becomes awkward, as the entire page needs to be loaded and displayed...
A single comment display would be extremely useful as the discussion
continues and possibly evolves over time.
(As I said, my biggest complaint is loading an entire thread of comments
when I want to only refer to a single one)

I envision the "single comment display" being a template, just like (or
perhaps part of) single.php.  Individual blog admins could style their
single comment / post template as they want.  If you want "full
context", use that.  If you prefer more granularity, use that.
The only requirement is that granular comment display requires ?c=X
querystring support.

I strongly agree on the point of flat structure and lack of heirarchy. In
principle, WordPress has a very flat chronological structure (as one would
expect from a blog), but this verges the impractical in large discussions. I
installed PHP-Nuke yesterday and it seems miles ahead of WordPress because its
structure is very clear, comments can be nested, moderated and even trigger
events. Since its is also GPL'd, perhaps its worth importing and re-using some
bits?

In terms of the hierarchy, I think their's room here for a full-scale
commenting plugin to be written. This was something I started quite a
while back, but that was way before the plugin architecture was in
place. I'll have another bash.

Sorry for butting in late, and you should really excuse me if the
opinions below are not even close to those that you may have. I was in
my verbose mood/mode when I typed the following out :)

I think we are fast getting to the point (if we are not there already)
where maintaining and supporting what's present is more complex than
creating something new. This is true of themes, plugins, the support
forums, documentation, mosquito, and the source.

Themes and Plugins:

Depending on end-user/creator initiatives alone won't quite cut it for
maintaining a resource of all available themes or plugins. I beleive
that it should be possible for others (other than the creator) to
check in or add themes and plugins to the repository, with control
over what's added being handed over, or extended to the creator later,
if requested.

Support:

Keeping up with whats happening is far more difficult now, and gone
are the days when I could check the support forums twice a day and
answer all the concerns (the main page at the forums used to have
10-24 hours worth of "new" posts), in a few hours, which is part of
the reason why I don't hang around there too much anymore. Kimmo's
idea of having people volunteer to act as the last stop for problems
of a specified nature, and directing those technical problems to such
folks sounds good, and very reasonable. If someone could give me a
list of issues that I could best address, I would spend some time on
it, everyday, if so required. What worked very well prior to WP
v1.3alpha for the support forums may not be working too well now, and
it's mostly because of the bloat in the sheer number of forums
questions. Old regulars are not so regular anymore. Kimmo's suggestion
sounds good, but there must be other options too worth exploring.

From time to time, I have had people offering to pay me to solve
WordPress problems. I do these jobs when I can, charging as little as
I can, only when the work is extensive. So the option of decentralized
paid support, without full-time employees, on a profit-sharing basis,
at extremely reasonable conditions for the users might be a good thing
to think about now. I am not saying that paid support is THE way to
go, or anything of that sort -- just that a venue for paid support,
where the supporter-users gain as much, if not more than the project
itself, would not be fundamentally evil, or anything of that sort.
Free support should always be there. Even if development can be
community-driven, the needs of varying kinds of folks may not always
be satisfied by a community. Other projects often have commercial
ventures backing them up, or providing services - maybe it is time for
WordPress to step up, anticipate the need, and start early, as opposed
to being reaction-oriented.

Documentation:

Fortunately, we have always had more than just a pair of good hands at
work at the documentation, throughout, and with a few more volunteers,
I think that part of the show can keep running.

Bugs and the Source:

I think as of now, the development effort is supported quite well by
the community.

Much of the frustration experienced by new users seems to be due to
the difficulty (and element of luck) involved in getting the right
people to respond to forum posts, and finding paid support. A few
steps should correct these.

After many nights of plugin competition deadline-induced insomnia, Blogs of 
the Day plugin 0.4 is ready! Thanks to the great input on this list, I have 
handled the following problems:
- Templates with not exactly one loop broke BOTD, inciting the REQUEST_URI 
hack. I moved most of the code onto the template_redirect hook and changed 
the way it finds the Post/Page ID. It now works no matter how loopy your 
template is; the only requirements are wp_head and wp_footer.
- Feed support is in the planning phase! Archives and searches are still 
unsupported and probably will remain so.
- BOTD displays sloppy titles and cannot categorize lists. I added a few 
short meta tags for BOTD to grab and parse:
	meta name='botd:version' content='0.4'
	meta name='botd:home' content='http://www.skeltoac.com'
	meta name='botd:name' content='Skeltoac'
	meta name='botd:title' content='Links'
	meta name='botd:type' content='page'
- Image not downloaded? I reverted the display default to "block" and 
reduced the image width and height properties to zero. You can reset them to 
80x15 in the code if you are so inclined. You can also place the image 
wherever you like in your template. Many people will want it in their links 
list but that is still in the dreaming phase.

"THANK YOU" to all those who have helped so far. Please update your plugin 
with the code at blogsoftheday.com and email me with any questions, comments 
or requests unless they would be of interest to this list.

Now I have a lot of work to do on the server!

I've enjoyed watching this plugin from its inception to this release. Lets 
hope the server holds up, or hope for some gracious donations for new 
servers quick! Good job Andy and others!

Oh, boy. I'm at work and I just noticed that I left some bad code in the 
plugin on the botd page. Please don't use it until I get home from work and 
update it, probably in about six hours, say 22:00 GMT.

Please direct all flames to my email address.

I've dug into the core a bit and not seen anything that would cause this 
kind of cross-session caching. My guess is that Apache or PHP is configured 
to serve the headers incorrectly or there is a caching proxy that's 
misinterpreting the headers. I wonder if the problem exists for people 
browsing from other locations.

Okay, I'm done messing with BOTD 0.4. Testers can go to blogsoftheday.com 
and get the new BOTD for real this time. To make up for my sloppiness, I 
added one last meta tag. Feast your eyes:
meta name='botd:cats' content='Diary,Personal,Main'
And as an added bonus, the BOTD plugin is now specially formulated to reduce 
bandwidth! Requests from the BOTD server, identified by a special query 
string, will be served the metadata and ONLY the metadata. Requests without 
the special string will not be burdened with the extra metadata.

This seems like sufficient advance for a new point: BOTD 0.5. Come and get 
it!

May 04 16:04:16 FrankieShakes photomatt: sure thing... thanks for your help 
thus far... much appreciated!
May 04 16:04:22 FrankieShakes skippy: do you mind assisting in pm?
May 04 16:04:23 photomatt Okay the agenda is on the wiki page in the topic
May 04 16:04:23 masquerade photomatt, why not move the IRC meetup to another 
chan so support can continue here..
May 04 16:04:25 * tanuki_ has quit (Connection timed out)
May 04 16:04:32 skippy shouldn't WE take it somewhere private, since we post 
all over that #wordpress is for support ?
May 04 16:04:49 Firenze $def Firenze is an anonymous blogger. mwhahaha
May 04 16:04:49 _infobot Firenze is an anonymous blogger. mwhahaha
May 04 16:04:58 skippy FrankieShakes: I can try to help, but can't promise 
much.
May 04 16:05:04 photomatt Okay, maybe the role of #wordpress is a better 
first topic :)
May 04 16:05:17 photomatt That was more #4, scaling support
May 04 16:06:04 photomatt as a method for support, IRC is very hit/miss. 
great if someone is there who has time to help you, horrible if people are 
chatting and ignoring you
May 04 16:06:29 photomatt during an active conversation things can scroll 
off after less than a minute
May 04 16:06:51 photomatt Podz has complained numerous times of not getting 
any help here himself, that's why he didn't like IRC for a while
May 04 16:06:52 * ryanpc

May 04 16:06:53 _infobot Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome ryanpc, im Cabaret, 
au Cabaret, to Cabaret
May 04 16:07:14 photomatt (and then everyone stopped talking)
May 04 16:07:28 skippy with respect to support:
May 04 16:07:39 skippy in the last month or so, I think #wordpress has 
really shaped up.
May 04 16:07:43 Podz it's an inherent fault of #irc
May 04 16:07:51 photomatt oh, hi Podz :)
May 04 16:07:54 Podz and I totally agree with what skippy just said :)
May 04 16:07:56 skippy I think enough people now have enough proficiency 
with 1.5 to offer helpful, useful comments.
May 04 16:07:58 Podz Hi Matt :)
May 04 16:08:02 * ColdForged nods
May 04 16:08:18 skippy when 1.5 first came out, we were all struggling to 
make sense of it for ourselves.
May 04 16:08:31 photomatt that makes sense
May 04 16:08:34 HauntedUnix Personally I believe IRC is a wonderful medium 
for support, however if you *ban* offtopic chatter here, the channel will 
die. I'd like to see the implementation of an in-house paid support, to say; 
fuel development, and greater emphasis on the use of the forums for support, 
however IRC should still be left as a strong-hold, as it is a realtime 
conversational mean.
May 04 16:08:40 * westi|wah is now known as westi
May 04 16:08:50 westi evening all
May 04 16:08:52 jefte not to mention the slew of 3rd party plugins and 
features we now have available...
May 04 16:08:52 skippy now we're in a pretty good "comfort zone" -- many 
known bugs are well identified; and lots of people are comfortabel int he 
code.
May 04 16:09:10 twistedraisin chuckg: there is the wordpress-pro mailing 
list
May 04 16:09:18 twistedraisin err HU, rather
May 04 16:09:18 chuckg Hmm?
May 04 16:09:19 photomatt does anyone here need support right now? since we 
already announced #wordpress as the channel for this week we can stay here 
and go to another channel next week

May 04 16:09:28 presroi hi
May 04 16:09:53 HauntedUnix twistedraisin: Less as a mailing list, more as 
an organised, centralised system.
May 04 16:10:18 photomatt paid support of some sort has been a semi-common 
request
May 04 16:10:19 Podz If anyone does, tell them to PM me so it beeps here and 
I'll see what I can do. I'm fiddling with my sites right now
May 04 16:10:22 skippy I would like to think that actual moderators for 
#wordpress would help; but I don't know if they really would.
May 04 16:10:30 photomatt my hesinance is that free support with wither if 
we offer paid support
May 04 16:10:34 photomatt *hesitance

May 04 16:10:57 HauntedUnix photomatt: The Gallery Project, although not 
quite parallel to Wordpress, offer both paid and free, and seem to get on 
with it just dandy.
May 04 16:11:12 photomatt HauntedUnix: I'll check out how they're doing that
May 04 16:11:14 twistedraisin photomatt: maybe some sort of wp-consulants 
site like guru or something? Thatway those that want to support wordpress, 
can.
May 04 16:11:15 * Clintology has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed 
out))
May 04 16:11:45 HauntedUnix photomatt: Would you like me to ask one of the 
Gallery contributors to pop in?
May 04 16:11:51 skippy I think paid support should be an independent 
operation; and not something run/sponsored by WordPress directly.
May 04 16:12:04 photomatt 
http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=GalleryPaidSupport&file=index
May 04 16:12:07 photomatt that's the gallery page
May 04 16:12:07 masquerade skippy, that would be known as "professional 
consulting"
May 04 16:12:09 HauntedUnix skippy: I've been presented with that idea, 
however I still think if it were in house, it'd recieve a greater support.
May 04 16:12:10 * Clintology
(~Clint@nr30-216-196-141-153.fuse.net<http://nr30-216-196-141-153.fuse.net>)

May 04 16:12:16 photomatt skippy: that's how it happens now, but it's hard 
for people to find it
May 04 16:12:23 westi i agree with skippy ... paid support could be 
something recommended much like the hosting page on wp.org <http://wp.org>
May 04 16:12:27 photomatt I would imagine it being somewhat of a marketplace 
hosted by WP
May 04 16:12:30 HauntedUnix skippy: Also there's then the guarantee for the 
money to be better plowed back into WP.
May 04 16:12:37 photomatt yes, like the hosting page somewhat
May 04 16:13:04 skippy yes, but it creates a dichotomy to our users. "Oh, I 
didn't PAY so my bug report will get less attention"...
May 04 16:13:08 westi maybe a prerequist of being listed on
wp.org<http://wp.org>would be that you pledge to donate something back
to wordpress from the moey
you make
May 04 16:13:13 skippy even if it's not true, that will be a perception.
May 04 16:13:31 photomatt skippy: but support != bug reports and fixing
May 04 16:13:38 HauntedUnix skippy: bug reports =! ..ah, nevermind
May 04 16:13:44 westi you should never have to pay to get bugs fixed .. 
support is about heling people install surely
May 04 16:13:50 HauntedUnix skippy: I meant less bug reporting, things like 
that, more.. advanced users who will fix specific problems, set up others 
blogs, et cetera.
May 04 16:14:33 skippy fair enough. Out of curiosity, how many support forum 
requests would be channeled to paid support, at a guess?
May 04 16:15:01 MCincubus probably the ones that are currently answered as 
"yeah, you could do that, but you'd have to write a plugin for it"
May 04 16:15:03 phenny MCincubus: 15:34Z <Admiral_Justin> tell MCincubus 
that I posted a workaround to the javascript issues with app/x+x to his post 
about the mime types
May 04 16:15:30 photomatt I would see people as starting with the paid 
support rather than going to the forums first
May 04 16:15:50 photomatt maybe Podz can speak to how he thinks the forums 
could react
May 04 16:15:54 jefte On the topic of support, I for one would not pay for 
support
May 04 16:16:24 * versuchsanstalt

all about culture & collaboration.) & GNU/Linux audio
May 04 16:16:28 jefte and while I do use the forums - wish for a better 
system for oganizing the posts
May 04 16:16:45 shep i don't like the new tags at the top of the forums
May 04 16:16:45 HauntedUnix jefte: Say you were a new, inexperienced user, 
and you had real problems with getting things working, do you think you 
still wouldn't pay?
May 04 16:16:48 shep bt that's just me
May 04 16:16:48 * ryanpc has quit (Remote closed the connection)
May 04 16:17:02 shep i don't see why people would have to pay
May 04 16:17:05 skippy the other problem with paid support is that the folks 
who contribute for free have a real disincentive for continuing. (I'm 
specifically thinking of my own contributions to the codex)
May 04 16:17:11 masquerade many users would not pay for support, but the 
ones that would be willing to pay would get a guarantee of a support staff's 
time to help diagnose and fix the problem
May 04 16:17:12 jefte I think because of the nature of the product (free, 
open-source) I don't expect to pay, to get the product to run
May 04 16:17:17 shep the support forums and this channel give help in a very 
timely matter
May 04 16:17:29 Podz to support ? You have the very easy stuff and grateful 
people through to the "I want it MY way and I'll pay pennies". I have had a 
few of them nag me to death so I avoid them at all costs now. the tricky 
part is saying enough is enough and drawing the line at the start.
May 04 16:17:30 westi from what i have seen on the forums a lot of people 
are willing to pay - mainly for theming but also for support in general
May 04 16:17:54 photomatt jefte: I don't think the target audience would be 
anyone in this chat or on the hackers list
May 04 16:18:11 shep the people in the forums that are willing to pay are 
people who seem to have lost hope
May 04 16:18:11 photomatt jefte: it's people who need more hand-holding than 
the forums can provide
May 04 16:18:16 jefte and I don't think I'm alone in this feeling. Most 
people looking for cheap solutions typically don't want to be encumbered 
with trying to set it up. Lucky for me - Word Press was easy to install. I'm 
the weakest hacker on the list.
May 04 16:18:18 HauntedUnix Do you think it'd be unreasonable to ask for $20 
for a customisation of WP?
May 04 16:18:21 jonabad westi: like a wordpress extended warranty
May 04 16:18:30 shep sure those people can still pay someone for help, but 
we shouldn't make support a paying issue
May 04 16:18:38 shep i know i love to help people out
May 04 16:18:44 shep as rare is it may be
May 04 16:18:49 photomatt free support would NEVER be eliminated, the codex 
would never go away, etc
May 04 16:18:53 jefte photomatt: while I'm on the list, I use it as a way to 
keep a thumb on the wp pulse. I cannot code well - more often than not I am 
breaking code.
May 04 16:18:54 shep remember, i'm just comic relief in here
May 04 16:19:00 westi HauntedUnix: sounds reasonable for a custom theme to 
solve someones needs.. if not cheap really considering how many hours can go 
into theming
May 04 16:19:02 masquerade I think that if anything, we should avoid calling 
it "Paid Support" and do something along the lines of "Professional 
Consulting"
May 04 16:19:03 HauntedUnix I think a social contract could do with adding 
in, Matt.
May 04 16:19:11 Podz I think the main point about paying is to get people to 
search better. I still do tons of free install etc - as I'm sure others here 
do - but I /had/ to put the pay thing on my pages because it was getting 
very silly the amount of mail and IM's I was getting
May 04 16:19:15 shep that may work
May 04 16:19:22 shep professional consulting
May 04 16:19:22 skippy photomatt: it's not a matter of it going away. It's a 
matter of someone else making money from my effort to document something on 
the codex. That irks em.
May 04 16:19:24 MCincubus masquerade, agreed.
May 04 16:19:27 skippy s/em/me
May 04 16:19:35 skeltoac It could be as simple as adding a category on the 
forums: Help For Hire.
May 04 16:19:46 shep skippy: makes since
May 04 16:19:48 shep sense
May 04 16:19:48 jefte thats not a bad idea actually...
May 04 16:19:51 shep man i can't type
May 04 16:20:07 photomatt skippy: how would someone be profiting off your 
codex work any more than they're profiting off the work of devs on WP?
May 04 16:20:30 MCincubus and if the info is freely available, the user 
could just use it themselves
May 04 16:20:38 skippy photomatt: hey, if you guys don't care, I can't stop 
you. I'm voicing my opinion. One of 96, presently.
May 04 16:20:42 masquerade I think that if someone wants to be a paid 
consultant, then power to them, but it shouldn't be something endorsed by 
WordPress as much as regular support
May 04 16:20:59 westi photomatt: i think that would be if people are 
charging for providing info to users that is freely available cause the use 
can't be bothered to search properly
May 04 16:21:09 HauntedUnix I think iof we did offer support, we'd have to 
have some sort of *organisation* to it.
May 04 16:21:18 HauntedUnix If we just let anyone go at it, they could end 
up posing as a WP dev, and ripping people off.
May 04 16:21:22 skeltoac Too many users prefer to have it done for them and 
are willing to pay. Open the door for those people and you could multiply 
the WordPress user base.
May 04 16:21:30 photomatt HauntedUnix: that's a big concern too
May 04 16:21:30 Podz And if a "Paid Supporter" seeks help for a client ? You 
WILL have idiots doing that
May 04 16:21:31 shep the info is freely out there, but some people just get 
frustrated, or want other people to do all the work themselves
May 04 16:21:34 masquerade WordPress' support has grown to the point that 
the ones who are looking for quick fixes and such can find them easily on 
the codex. The people who need their hand held through every bit might be 
interested in consulting rather than "support"
May 04 16:21:44 shep and i guess if that's the case, a consiltant isn't a 
bad idea
May 04 16:21:48 shep consultant
May 04 16:22:01 photomatt all the information is out there to do anything, 
all the way down to the source code, I think for most people it's a matter 
of having the time to grok it
May 04 16:22:07 skeltoac Independent consulting is already a fact.
May 04 16:22:07 SteamedPenguin save support for forums?
May 04 16:22:10 HauntedUnix I'd like to see a system similar to Gallery, 
whilst keeping the individuality.
May 04 16:22:13 SteamedPenguin WTF is that?
May 04 16:22:14 HauntedUnix SteamedPenguin: During the meeting, I presume.
May 04 16:22:22 photomatt We have a mailing list of professional WP 
consultants, it hasn't had much traffic
May 04 16:22:32 SteamedPenguin ah
May 04 16:22:35 skeltoac I've never seen it advertised!
May 04 16:22:37 SteamedPenguin oops
May 04 16:22:38 jefte nore I
May 04 16:22:41 shep neither have i
May 04 16:22:45 shep i never knew about it
May 04 16:22:50 MCincubus Heh, I remember it being mentioned, in passing
May 04 16:22:50 jonabad I had to dig around to get into it
May 04 16:22:53 photomatt okay, well that's a first problem
May 04 16:22:56 skeltoac Right.
May 04 16:22:57 jefte hahahah clearly.
May 04 16:23:03 photomatt where should it go on the site?
May 04 16:23:08 shep and i'm betting that 98% of the people on the board 
(100% of newbs) don't know
May 04 16:23:15 skeltoac Probably as a sticky in the forums.
May 04 16:23:16 ringmaster WordPress SUPPORT: $50/ hour. Email me. (Now you 
have.)
May 04 16:23:19 westi photomatt: on the subject of grok'ing .. maybe the 
support page on wp.org <http://wp.org> should link to the codex... then 
people might search there first aswell as the forums before asking the same 
questions over and over
May 04 16:23:33 skeltoac YES
May 04 16:23:36 Firenze can someone please tell me, why a domain like 
blah.com <http://blah.com> is a 2 level domain? what's a first level then?
May 04 16:23:43 shep i also think there should be a clear link to this room
May 04 16:23:45 skippy Firenze: com is the first
May 04 16:24:01 shep there are a lot of people in here that give great help
May 04 16:24:07 skippy Is there some requirement for joining the WP Pro 
list? Can anybody join?
May 04 16:24:07 photomatt shep: I'm hesitant to drive newbies to IRC or any 
other ephemeral medium
May 04 16:24:11 skeltoac Firenze: com is called a Top Level Domain.
May 04 16:24:11 Firenze blah.com <http://blah.com> is second,
woot.blah.com<http://woot.blah.com>is 3rd
May 04 16:24:13 shep plus geeksmakemehot likes to play truth or dare
May 04 16:24:18 Firenze that's what's confusing me
May 04 16:24:20 photomatt IRC is unsearchable, not publicly archived, etc
May 04 16:24:24 shep true
May 04 16:24:25 jefte photomatt: Maybe you could list all mailing lists in 
the right column of the support page?
May 04 16:24:33 photomatt a question answered in the forums may help 10 
people instead of 1
May 04 16:24:41 ColdForged [17:22] photomatt: a question answered in the 
forums may help 10 people instead of 1 ++
May 04 16:24:49 masquerade jefte, while that might sound like a good idea, 
our Hackers list would be flooded with support questions in no time at all
May 04 16:24:52 photomatt jefte: except the mailing lists are expressly NOT 
for support
May 04 16:24:53 Firenze skeltoac :: yes, thanks you, but it was not what i 
was asking
May 04 16:24:56 photomatt except wp-testers, which is for nightlies
May 04 16:24:59 jonabad I think there ought to be a way to search both codex 
and forums
May 04 16:25:00 shep photomatt: but it should be clearly stated somewhere, 
that there is a IRC room if all other support fails
May 04 16:25:01 skeltoac Yes, I still get hits referred from my Blogger 
Importer posts on the forums.
May 04 16:25:09 jefte good points
May 04 16:25:24 photomatt also some insane number of searches are run on the 
forums per day
May 04 16:25:35 jefte so how do we make available a list of wp consultants 
for people to tap into and pay for hand-holding help?
May 04 16:25:37 * nosebleed|work has quit ("For every action, there's an 
equal but opposite excuse")
May 04 16:25:37 photomatt I think it was 5 figures or close to it
May 04 16:25:49 westi photomatt: do they produce good results though?
May 04 16:26:11 photomatt westi: no/yes
May 04 16:26:11 skeltoac I think a list of consultants is trouble. It 
implies endorsement and trust.
May 04 16:26:11 westi the same questions do seem to come up that can be 
answered by a simple targetted search
May 04 16:26:25 jonabad photomatt: i definitely search like 5 times for 1 
answer
May 04 16:26:35 photomatt how about a subpage of /about/ is added that links 
to the WP PRo list
May 04 16:26:39 jefte well the wp-consultants list is effectively this - but 
unendorsed?
May 04 16:26:43 photomatt I can call it "Professional Consultants"
May 04 16:26:57 SteamedPenguin besides, should it be wp.org <http://wp.org>'s 
mission to 'advertise' consultants? who gets on the list, who gets off?
May 04 16:27:09 photomatt and mention that the wp-pro list is essentially a 
marketplace to reach people interested in WP work
May 04 16:27:13 trevorturk photomatt, (knowing that you made bbpress) why 
not use punbb? i love it.
May 04 16:27:20 * westi would like a feed of activity on forum posts he has 
authored/ replied to .. is that possible?
May 04 16:27:43 masquerade westi, hack away at bbpress and about anything is 
possible
May 04 16:27:49 MCincubus well, it either has to be explicit endorsement, or 
explicit non-endorsement (and an open forum)
May 04 16:27:52 skippy photomatt: is the Pro list for solicitation of 
business?
May 04 16:27:55 photomatt trevorturk: when the forums started punbb used 
tables everywhere, was really hard to integrate with the design, and still 
doesn't support tags
May 04 16:27:58 ringmaster Any list of consultants is not a matter of 
endorsing anyone. It's about centralizing the list. Any display of such a 
list could clearly deny endorsement.
May 04 16:28:03 westi masquerade: i will... when i have the time!
May 04 16:28:07 skippy if so, that sounds like chaos: "Who wants to help 
me?!" "me me me!"
May 04 16:28:16 photomatt skippy: that's how markets work
May 04 16:28:26 skeltoac Yup.
May 04 16:28:32 photomatt that's also how the Six Apart pronet works
May 04 16:28:34 photomatt FYI
May 04 16:28:36 trevorturk photomatt, that's true - pubb could use some 
sweet wp-esqe theme feature!
May 04 16:28:49 jefte I can see it now, wp "consultants" barking out for 
customers in a digital marketplace.
May 04 16:28:49 SteamedPenguin ah yes
May 04 16:28:52 HauntedUnix Can I suggest, there's an ML of people who are 
*authorised* by either WP Foundation, or a third-party entity which are 
covering this. Each support ticket is sent to the ML, and each member from 
the ML is listed on the website?

May 04 16:29:14 _infobot Welcome, jtxd; is this your first time here?
May 04 16:29:16 SteamedPenguin emulating six apart, always a good path
May 04 16:29:19 skeltoac If it's an open market we need, the forums might be 
a good place to host it. Just adding the Help For Hire category could do the 
trick.
May 04 16:29:19 photomatt HauntedUnix: authorising people is a VERY slippery 
slope
May 04 16:29:32 photomatt SteamedPenguin: learning from other's mistakes and 
successes is always good :)
May 04 16:29:41 ColdForged Could be broken down by specialties: design, CSS, 
template tags, plugins
May 04 16:29:44 SteamedPenguin photomatt: six apart is a company
May 04 16:29:44 photomatt skeltoac: trying to minimize the non-support 
traffic on the forums
May 04 16:29:45 HauntedUnix photomatt: I'd say people you trust, people who 
have exhibited themselves as able, and those who you know will work when 
they have to.. it's a bit favourist, but it's the best ay to go
May 04 16:29:51 skeltoac Of course, it would need the disclaimer at the top 
:)
May 04 16:29:58 shep if you do the consulting thing you def need to make 
sure that you don't claim any responsibility
May 04 16:30:11 photomatt HauntedUnix: that'd be very elitist, would exclude 
newcomers, and just because I like someone doesn't mean they're good to hire
May 04 16:30:25 shep you don't want people to get pissed because their 
"consultant" didn't do what they wanted
May 04 16:30:30 ringmaster Something like elance.com <http://elance.com> but 
focused at WP would be handy.
May 04 16:30:37 shep and yell at WP, when it wasn't WP's fault
May 04 16:30:40 photomatt ringmaster: sure, with rating and history, etc
May 04 16:30:43 shep a clear division must be there
May 04 16:30:47 HauntedUnix photomatt: I mean to avoid favourtism as much as 
possible, but to go with people who you're sure you can trust. Perhaps do... 
a test of some sort?
May 04 16:30:49 photomatt ringmaster: but that's Lots of Work
May 04 16:30:53 ringmaster too true.
May 04 16:30:54 jefte sounds like a whole new site to me - 
wp-consultants.com <http://wp-consultants.com>
May 04 16:30:56 SteamedPenguin photomatt: operating an open source project 
like operating a commercial company only beholden to its masters is 
different
May 04 16:30:57 masquerade I move that we table this discussion and move on 
to another topic, leave paid support for the next meeting
May 04 16:31:10 shep ok
May 04 16:31:15 jefte seconded.
May 04 16:31:21 shep all in favor\
May 04 16:31:22 skeltoac hear hear. sleep on it.
May 04 16:31:23 SteamedPenguin photomatt: on the other hand, there is no 
reason why there can't be acompany that's centered around offering WP 
services and integration
May 04 16:31:24 shep aye
May 04 16:31:25 ringmaster aye.
May 04 16:31:26 MCincubus aye
May 04 16:31:27 twistedraisin aye
May 04 16:31:29 HauntedUnix GOatse.
May 04 16:31:30 trevorturk is this about an alternative to the wp-pro 
mailing list?
May 04 16:31:30 photomatt alright
May 04 16:31:31 masquerade let everyone refine their thoughts and opinions 
and we'll get some better discussion
May 04 16:31:42 photomatt </consultants>
May 04 16:31:45 SteamedPenguin heh
May 04 16:31:48 photomatt <1.5.1>
May 04 16:31:50 ColdForged ba-dum-tish
May 04 16:32:10 photomatt Okay 1.5.1 needs to go out ASAP, what are the 
outstanding bugs?
May 04 16:32:11 ColdForged It was released yesterday, right?
May 04 16:32:11 twistedraisin heh, what major outstandings are there still 
before 1.5.1?
May 04 16:32:23 photomatt ColdForged: in a perfect world :)
May 04 16:32:23 ColdForged </joke>
May 04 16:32:25 MCincubus have there been any problems with the RSS and CURL 
stuff?
May 04 16:32:40 photomatt MCincubus: I checked in something that used curl 
if it was available, fopen if it wasn't
May 04 16:32:46 masquerade MCincubus, I believe that was fixed
May 04 16:32:54 twistedraisin not since 1.3a versions, iirc
May 04 16:32:55 MCincubus so no one has been having problems with it?
May 04 16:33:07 * milk has quit
("www.milkmiruku.com<http://www.milkmiruku.com>/ brb")
May 04 16:33:11 rboren Assuming curl works out and the 304 fix works out, I 
think 1.5.1 is ready.

double checking mosquito to see if there's anything else major
May 04 16:33:35 photomatt so the relevant bugs are
May 04 16:33:35 photomatt http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1275
May 04 16:33:38 * shep watches this discussion, since he knows nothing about 
coding and has no jokes about this topic
May 04 16:33:46 photomatt and http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1166
May 04 16:33:51 jefte I had a lot of trouble with /catagory permalink 
structure when I was wp newbie 1 month ago.
May 04 16:33:52 skeltoac I'm not running nightlies, but i had trouble with 
CURL on a GoDaddy-hosted account. Required a proxy.
May 04 16:34:02 shep what is CURL?
May 04 16:34:10 SteamedPenguin while not a major bug, WP 1.5 is still 
missing Atom feeds.
May 04 16:34:21 photomatt http://www.google.com/search?q=curl
May 04 16:34:26 twistedraisin atom is a pretty straightforward api
May 04 16:34:30 shep thanks matt
May 04 16:34:33 photomatt SteamedPenguin: Missing atom feeds??
May 04 16:34:33 MCincubus http://curl.haxx.se/docs/faq.shtml
May 04 16:34:38 skeltoac shep: It's a PHP library that lets you do HTTP 
stuff without fsockopen.
May 04 16:34:43 skeltoac (basically0
May 04 16:34:48 SteamedPenguin photomatt: yeah, comment Atom feeds.
May 04 16:34:49 photomatt SteamedPenguin: if you mean comment feeds, that's 
not going to make this release
May 04 16:35:07 SteamedPenguin photomatt: I gathered as much.
May 04 16:35:13 twistedraisin photomatt: is it on the roadmap at all?
May 04 16:35:19 photomatt I believe your bug is still open on that though?
May 04 16:35:19 westi photomatt: and shouldn't if 1.5.1 is "just bug fixes" 
;)
May 04 16:35:53 photomatt it's bug fixes and enhancements
May 04 16:35:58 masquerade As far as the RSS 304 bug, its been working fine 
here
May 04 16:36:11 masquerade with CVS checked out a few minutes ago
May 04 16:36:21 photomatt masquerade: does it return 304s when it's supposed 
to?
May 04 16:36:56 masquerade photomatt, Yep, and its not sending it when there 
are updates
May 04 16:37:14 photomatt can anyone else confirm? I'd like to close that 
bug
May 04 16:37:21 * skippy has quit (Remote closed the connection)
May 04 16:37:24 photomatt I can't break it myself

May 04 16:38:26 photomatt I think that's it for 1.5.1, the only thing I may 
add is some documentation links on the plugin and theme pages
May 04 16:39:12 shep anything else on the list
May 04 16:39:33 rboren Did we address everything with Waldegger?
May 04 16:39:34 photomatt The new hosting page, any feedback?
May 04 16:39:38 MCincubus Should there be a grace period, before it is 
released? i.e. let the wp-hackers and wp-testers people pound it and try to 
break it for a few days?
May 04 16:39:51 shep i think its helpful
May 04 16:39:53 ringmaster Is it supposed to be sending back a last_modified 
header?

May 04 16:40:06 _infobot Milords, Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome twood
May 04 16:40:12 shep some people aren't sure what hosts to use, and that can 
lead them in the right direction
May 04 16:40:21 skeltoac I'd like to know how much the new hosting page is 
increasing WP's cash flow.
May 04 16:40:26 shep and at least allow them to see what kind of specs they 
should be looking for
May 04 16:40:27 SteamedPenguin MCincubus: say seven days?
May 04 16:40:43 MCincubus SteamedPenguin, that would be plenty, methinks
May 04 16:40:48 photomatt MCincubus: 
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2005-April/000171.html
May 04 16:40:51 westi photomatt: hosting page is good,,, my only comment is 
it is unclear to me why powerweb is being highlighted - does it mean that 
wordpress recommends it above the others for ex?
May 04 16:41:04 shep westi: i had the same question
May 04 16:41:34 westi also should the list self randomize so that it appears 
in a different order each time so as not to show preference?
May 04 16:41:45 MCincubus Eek, I hope not.
May 04 16:41:52 MCincubus PowWeb wouldn't be my first choice.
May 04 16:42:04 photomatt w/r/t PowWeb, right now they have the best combo 
of a WP auto-install, phone support for WP, specs, and donating back to WP
May 04 16:42:23 photomatt the order doesn't seem to effect what people click 
on
May 04 16:42:30 photomatt Laughing Squid has the second most clicks on that 
page
May 04 16:42:38 Podz cute logo :)
May 04 16:42:42 jonabad great name
May 04 16:42:44 westi Podz: :)
May 04 16:42:51 photomatt even though they're at the end
May 04 16:42:59 shep i clicked it cause of name
May 04 16:43:05 photomatt so that tells me people are reading the whole 
page, which is what we want anyway
May 04 16:43:24 shep photomatt: why only those hosts?
May 04 16:43:25 * nacken_ has quit (Connection timed out)
May 04 16:43:26 photomatt it's not one-size-fits-all
May 04 16:43:41 photomatt shep: a combo of big and small, but all high 
quality IMO
May 04 16:43:50 westi photomatt: thats cool then... i think you have to be 
careful not to accidentally show preference.. or imply preference when its 
not there ... thats all
May 04 16:43:53 photomatt rboren: it's still possible to load template files 
directly
May 04 16:44:00 shep ok, i was just wondering, cause i noticed a lot of 
people use Site5, and that's not on there
May 04 16:44:07 photomatt rboren: we can't .htaccess it because that'd also 
block CSS/images in that directory and wouldn't work on IIS anyway
May 04 16:44:08 MCincubus could randomize it, if you eventually add a lot of 
hosts
May 04 16:44:24 photomatt rboren: I wouldn't want to add crap to the top of 
every template file either
May 04 16:44:45 rboren Nor I.
May 04 16:44:46 photomatt MCincubus: there are plenty of hosting directories 
where people can see a lot of hosts, we want to highlight just a few
May 04 16:45:02 photomatt the page will never have more than 5, and will 
probably have fewer in the future
May 04 16:45:17 MCincubus Yeah, I think your disclaimer covers that
May 04 16:45:25 chye-fhut photomatt : that's what gallery is also doing.
May 04 16:45:37 chye-fhut i think.
May 04 16:45:45 photomatt rboren: as for filtering options/titles, that's 
somewhat academic. we could do it in a future release. I'd like to filter 
lower level users through KSES in the next release
May 04 16:46:33 rboren OK
May 04 16:46:45 MCincubus multi-user and open-contribution stuff would be 
pretty high up on my list.
May 04 16:46:51 * milk has quit

May 04 16:47:08 jonabad "new logo"
May 04 16:47:10 photomatt Yes, tags on the forums
May 04 16:47:18 shep i don't like them
May 04 16:47:19 photomatt how do you guys feel they could be done better?
May 04 16:47:22 * nacken

May 04 16:47:25 shep but they can be helpful to noobs
May 04 16:47:44 ringmaster *Confirm* on the feed 304 working properly.
May 04 16:47:52 masquerade While on the forums, I noticed someone earlier 
said the "freshness" is a bit confusing
May 04 16:48:02 MCincubus photomatt, a little sentence explaining them, so 
pople don't do "having" "a" "problem" "with" "my" "sidebar" as tags because 
they don't know what tags are for
May 04 16:48:31 masquerade I second that one
May 04 16:48:32 jonabad "theme" and "themes" as tags is... frustrating as is 
a "wordpress" tag
May 04 16:48:34 MCincubus maybe and e.g.
May 04 16:48:42 westi tags are good... but they clash a bit with the sub 
areas of the forums... maybe the areas could be built from the tags instead 
of by having specific defined areas?
May 04 16:49:02 MCincubus "For example, if your post is about a plugin that 
doesn't work with 1.5, you could put "1.5 plugin broken" in the tag section"
May 04 16:49:14 westi and also a way of creating removing tags from a post 
you added them to
May 04 16:49:26 photomatt MCincubus: would you be up for writing an 
explanation of tags for the Codex?
May 04 16:49:30 westi for when you create "a very silly tag by accident"
May 04 16:49:35 masquerade westi, building from tags would make the forums a 
whole mess of clutter and confusion since there's no way to control what 
users post as tags
May 04 16:49:59 MCincubus photomatt, sure. I'm not on wiki formatting, but 
Relle has offered to be my translator :-)
May 04 16:50:02 photomatt westi: deleting tags is on the agenda
May 04 16:50:19 photomatt you will be able to delete your own tags and mods 
will be able to delete other's tags
May 04 16:50:43 MCincubus how about different colored tags for "added by 
thread author" or "added by mods"
May 04 16:50:52 MCincubus Consumating does that
May 04 16:50:56 westi masquerade: i would counter that build hierarchies 
from tags would work as a good way of organising the info within the forum 
as it helps you bring together things on a similar subject easily makes the 
forum grow more organically
May 04 16:50:57 shep photomatt: wp t-shirts coming anytime?
May 04 16:51:12 westi t-shirts++
May 04 16:51:25 shep and are we letting anyone submit designs?
May 04 16:51:27 masquerade westi, but not everyone tags alike, and newbies 
won't immeidately get the concept of "tagging"
May 04 16:51:39 photomatt want to wait on new schwag for the logo refresh
May 04 16:51:49 ringmaster Autosuggesting tags could be helpful..
May 04 16:51:57 shep i like the logo
May 04 16:52:02 skeltoac When I have time to help/haunt the forums, I would 
like to see a single list of unanswered posts.
May 04 16:52:03 shep its simple, just like WP
May 04 16:52:04 photomatt ringmaster: it needs some AJAX loving
May 04 16:52:22 Podz skeltoac:: agreed
May 04 16:52:25 masquerade westi, maybe keeping the structure, but having 
the option to organize by tags in subcategories
May 04 16:52:26 westi ringmaster: ... tags based on the subject and existing 
tags would be good
May 04 16:52:27 photomatt shep: let's talk about the logo in a few minutes, 
stick to the forums for now
May 04 16:52:34 shep any i like my design for the t-shirt: 
http://www.mikeschepker.com/wptshirtsmall.jpg
May 04 16:52:40 shep will do photomatt
May 04 16:52:40 photomatt I think flickr's tag interface is pretty ideal
May 04 16:52:44 MCincubus yeah, I always scan for "1" when I go to the 
forums.
May 04 16:52:49 westi masquerade: sounds good... we need to harness the 
power of tags as an access methog fully
May 04 16:52:50 SteamedPenguin hmm
May 04 16:52:57 MCincubus What would help is an "resolved" or "unresolved" 
status.
May 04 16:53:06 SteamedPenguin building on technologies like AJAX could have 
some serious drawbacks
May 04 16:53:17 skeltoac MC: That too.
May 04 16:53:21 SteamedPenguin browsers like Opera and Konqueror aren't 
there yet in current iterations
May 04 16:53:21 photomatt MCincubus: I agree, I wonder if we could have a 
special tag for that
May 04 16:53:30 westi it would also be nice to have a quick link technique 
for linking to other forum posts by id
May 04 16:53:37 photomatt SteamedPenguin: Opera is there, Konq can use the 
HTML version that's there now
May 04 16:53:44 SteamedPenguin hmm
May 04 16:54:06 SteamedPenguin Opera 8 reportedly has problems with that new 
37 signals app.
May 04 16:54:10 ringmaster Dojo has great fallback mechanisms for using 
iframes if the browser doesn't support xmlhttprequest, too.
May 04 16:54:25 skeltoac Would it be to hard to add a boolean field to each 
thread? resolved=true/false
May 04 16:54:29 skeltoac with a checkbox
May 04 16:54:29 SteamedPenguin BaseCamp
May 04 16:54:35 photomatt ringmaster: how hard would it be to have a simple 
in-place tag adder in place of the page refresh we have now?
May 04 16:54:45 photomatt skeltoac: who would check that box?
May 04 16:54:47 westi ringmaster: oooh that sounds good.. i have a product 
in production thats been using iframes to do ajax alike stuff for a few 
years now
May 04 16:54:47 michel_v yo
May 04 16:54:56 ringmaster photomatt: very not hard.
May 04 16:54:56 masquerade skeltoac, that in itself would be easy, but who 
should have the right to mark threads as resolved or unresolved and who has 
the power to change them?
May 04 16:54:57 photomatt Hi michel_v
May 04 16:55:05 shep i have to go eat and get a hair cut. good day guys
May 04 16:55:12 shep keep me posted on logo
May 04 16:55:25 MCincubus photomatt, they should start "unresolved" and be 
changed by either the threat starter, or a mod
May 04 16:55:52 skeltoac I imagine anyone could. I don't imagine it would be 
a problem.
May 04 16:55:59 MCincubus probably not...
May 04 16:56:18 michel_v the thread starter, you surely mean
May 04 16:56:30 photomatt also some threads don't lend themselves to 
registration, eg "check out my site"
May 04 16:56:31 MCincubus michel_v, yeah, although sometimes both :-\
May 04 16:56:51 michel_v hmm
May 04 16:56:54 MCincubus photomatt, those are in a specific section, 
though, right?
May 04 16:56:54 masquerade skeltoac, I know a place that tried that on their 
forums once, and they had a lot of problems with people who reply with 
suggestions marking the thread as resolved although the poster still didn't 
understand the post helping out
May 04 16:57:01 photomatt not registration, I meant resolution
May 04 16:57:15 michel_v generally, in most support forums, the thread 
starter is responsible for editing the thread's title with some string like 
[resolved]
May 04 16:57:19 MCincubus like "Your WordPress" isn't support.
May 04 16:57:30 ringmaster "Yes, your site looks good. - Resolved."
May 04 16:57:35 photomatt ha!
May 04 16:57:44 skeltoac A lot of people never return to acknowledge 
resolution. It would be quite a burden on moderators.
May 04 16:57:55 westi no .. "Your site doesn't look good - Resolved"
May 04 16:57:56 photomatt ringmaster: does "not hard" mean 30 minutes? a 
day? a million dollars?
May 04 16:57:57 Podz I would like Your Wordpress not to figure in the most 
recent - would remove a lot of clutter
May 04 16:58:00 MCincubus so, it could be open to the public, via a tag
May 04 16:58:06 photomatt skeltoac: another good point
May 04 16:58:12 skeltoac Podz: I second.
May 04 16:58:20 michel_v I wish "Your Wordpress" threads were absent from 
the recent threads list
May 04 16:58:28 photomatt Podz: perhaps it should be removed altogether
May 04 16:58:32 MCincubus seconded, michel_v 
May 04 16:58:43 photomatt that might be better for an external forum
May 04 16:58:45 michel_v oh yeah, beat to thepunch by podz
May 04 16:58:49 photomatt not /support/
May 04 16:58:52 westi Your Wordpress should be a seperate forum from support 
if it exists at all
May 04 16:58:57 Podz no .... but just hidden. All it takes is once person to 
blitz that forum and the front page is full of bumps
May 04 16:59:01 michel_v I'm mildly drunk :/
May 04 16:59:39 ringmaster photomatt: It's basically a matter of adding the 
Dojo include, creating a javascript array to pass in the input ID and the 
php file that processes the request, and then having the php file return 
javascript that will add the new item to the lag list.
May 04 16:59:51 Podz whichever - would free up the most recent and that has 
to be good
May 04 17:00:17 ringmaster So, essentiall about 2 hours to perfection, and a 
million dollars. I take checks.
May 04 17:00:43 MCincubus if we make all /support/ threads actually be 
support, we can auto-add an "unresolved" tag to each new thread.
May 04 17:00:47 skeltoac A zero-reply list would still be a great addition,

May 04 17:01:05 MCincubus that could be a dynamic tag...
May 04 17:01:10 photomatt skeltoac: zero-reply, one-reply, and needing tags 
are coming
May 04 17:01:13 MCincubus when the first reply comes, the "noresponse" goes 
away

May 04 17:02:04 ringmaster A default checklist of tags might be handy for 
classifying support issues directly.
May 04 17:02:23 skeltoac MC, not bad. There is already a function for 
bolding the titles of unanswered posts.
May 04 17:02:34 photomatt Podz: I'll look at removing your WP from recent

May 04 17:02:48 Podz photomatt:: :)
May 04 17:02:57 skeltoac also :)
May 04 17:03:08 photomatt ringmaster: since I'm going to be working on 
bbPress anyway, do you want to coordinate on the AJAX tag part?
May 04 17:04:49 * twood has quit ("Leaving")
May 04 17:05:06 ringmaster photomatt: I'd love to, but I'm already stretched 
a little thin, and I know nothing about bbPress internals already.
May 04 17:06:47 jonabad photomatt: we're coming up on the end of the hour
May 04 17:07:00 jonabad next topic?
May 04 17:07:31 photomatt alright I'll try it out, I'll ping you if I run 
into anything too weird
May 04 17:07:44 ringmaster photomatt: Definitely.
May 04 17:07:52 skeltoac I have a quick announcement for those in the know: 
BOTD 0.5 is online and very slick. I'd especially like to see if it works as 
expected on photomatt.net <http://photomatt.net>.
May 04 17:07:55 MCincubus We should start a Codex page for these meetups, 
where people can suggest topics ahead of time.
May 04 17:08:13 masquerade MCincubus, photomatt did that earlier

May 04 17:08:55 MCincubus Hot... found it.
May 04 17:10:35 photomatt http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups
May 04 17:10:46 photomatt okay all that's left is the "new logo"
May 04 17:10:46 traveller hm.....the same get_sidebar(); call produces two 
different results
May 04 17:10:53 photomatt just some background
May 04 17:11:20 photomatt the main problem with the current logo is it 
doesn't really have a "mark" that translates well onto different mediums and 
sizes
May 04 17:11:48 traveller i modified the sidebar.php to display my profile, 
in the main page it does so, but if click on another link it doesn't display 
the profiles, just a blank section with heading
May 04 17:11:52 MCincubus Right, like six aparts "dots"
May 04 17:11:56 photomatt I like the WP logo typography though
May 04 17:12:19 jonabad so like a "WP" mark?
May 04 17:12:27 photomatt exactly
May 04 17:12:29 ringmaster Yes, such a 16x16 or otherwise square-shaped logo 
would be very useful.
May 04 17:12:41 photomatt more like a refinement of the current logo rather 
than doing something completely different
May 04 17:12:48 jonabad because I also like the typographic look to it, it 
has gravitas
May 04 17:12:56 * dantekgeek has quit (Read error: 60 (Operation timed out))
May 04 17:12:57 photomatt agreed
May 04 17:13:02 MCincubus So, "WP" in the blue/black
May 04 17:13:11 photomatt so I've been working with a designer on some new 
things
May 04 17:13:29 photomatt it's still black and white because that's how logo 
work is done, so colors don't change your perception of the mark
May 04 17:13:51 skeltoac I envision a simplified image of an old drum litho 
press with WP rolling out
May 04 17:14:18 photomatt we've gone through about five iterations, would 
you guys like a peek and to give some feedback?
May 04 17:14:25 skeltoac YES!
May 04 17:14:27 jonabad sock it to me
May 04 17:14:28 MCincubus absolutely
May 04 17:14:33 photomatt okay
May 04 17:14:37 photomatt one note beforehand
May 04 17:14:39 ringmaster No. Oh, wait... yes!
May 04 17:14:50 photomatt there is going to be X percentage of people that 
will dislike ANY change
May 04 17:15:06 skeltoac granted
May 04 17:15:10 photomatt for example, the feedback
wired.com<http://wired.com>got on their CSS redesign got was
overwhelmingly negative
May 04 17:15:29 photomatt even though most people would agree (and newcomers 
much prefered) the new look is better
May 04 17:15:39 MCincubus people are more willing to express negative 
feedback..
May 04 17:15:49 photomatt so in dealing with anything you have a lot of 
experience with that may be changing, keep an open mind :)
May 04 17:16:14 photomatt and form your opinion before coming back to the 
channel to see what other people say
May 04 17:16:43 jonabad less suspense!

May 04 17:19:10 mikelittle Of the two. 4.01 keeping the singel word works 
better for me.
May 04 17:19:25 neuro` re
May 04 17:19:27 masquerade I like 4.01, for the same reason as mikelittle 
May 04 17:19:30 jonabad 4.01 #1 for me with the capitalized W and P
May 04 17:19:52 jonabad the w in the circle, not so much a fan of
May 04 17:19:57 MCincubus It's "WordPress," not "Word Press", so splitting 
it up will kill that distinction.
May 04 17:20:12 SteamedPenguin MCincubus: aye aye
May 04 17:20:27 MCincubus Best of the bunch... 4.01, top
May 04 17:20:27 mikelittle I'm not sure about the camel case. I always type 
it wrongly. Maybe its time to drop it. Meaning the lower version on 4.01 
May 04 17:20:29 masquerade my only suggestion might be to make the W and P 
slightly larger
May 04 17:20:44 chye-fhut i think so too, MCincubus 
May 04 17:21:05 masquerade just a tad larger, not much, but a tad larger 
than 4.01 top
May 04 17:21:16 MCincubus I might go for a more daring shape than a perfect 
circle on the "W" logo
May 04 17:21:35 westi photomatt: i do't like it with the W in the middle .. 
it doesn't work for me .. the 4.01 one looks gooed though
May 04 17:21:50 photomatt or separate the words?

May 04 17:23:17 SteamedPenguin nah
May 04 17:23:23 SteamedPenguin wordpress should be one word
May 04 17:23:23 MCincubus I say "WordPress"
May 04 17:23:26 Podz How does it look 32*32 or smaller ? For footers and 
such ?
May 04 17:23:32 mikelittle A thought, if you separate the words would that 
make it less able to be trademarked. It becomes an ordinary english phrase.
May 04 17:23:40 Podz MCincubus:: agreed
May 04 17:23:44 MCincubus mikelittle, point
May 04 17:23:51 SteamedPenguin I like wordpress 
May 04 17:23:55 MCincubus or rather, "WORDPRESS" but with "smallcaps"
May 04 17:24:01 photomatt Podz: the circle W scales well to different sizes
May 04 17:24:02 SteamedPenguin camel casing it has no real value IMHO
May 04 17:24:11 photomatt I also think it would look nice on 
hats/shirts/thongs/etc

May 04 17:26:57 skeltoac That's the kind of physical object WordPress makes

This has been asked a few times and I don't recall the answer.

If I write a post today, but set it to publish tomorrow, when does 
pingomatic get informed, if at all ?
And would that be the same for trackbacks ?

Future-dated posts do not generate pings, last I knew.

That might be worth checking on, because I think I've been seeing pings 
come across from my site when I future-date a post...

This logic still isn't complete. It only handles the case where both the 
If-Modified-Since *and* the If-None-Match (ETag) headers are present. 
But the spec allows for a case where only one (either one) of the 
headers is present.

If only one of them is present, then it must satisfy its condition in 
order to return a 304: either If-Modified-Since is >= the web content's 
modify date, OR the If-None-Match is equal to what the server thinks it 
should be.

If both are present, then both conditions must be true (which is all 
we're checking right now).

We need to put back in support for the case where only one of the 
headers are present, or we'll be missing some 304 opportunities, and 
wasting bandwidth.

Agreed, that was my conclusion yesterday. I was trying by hand with
telnet and only using if-modified-since. I didn't see a 304 in any of
my tests. I was intending to investigate further but ran out of time.

Looking at the source, it appears things get pinged when 'Publish' is
pressed. So things are pinged when you click on the publish button,
even if that post is future dated.

As for trackbacks, I'm not entirely sure I understand you. How can you
future data a trackback? Anyway, things are pinged when the trackback
comes in.

That seems wierd ... revealing what the author does not want to be 
revealed until a certain time. I'm not bothered at all - it would be 
nice to put a definitive answer into the forums though.

I think that there should be a pseudo-cron service built into WP.  
events could be loaded up with scheduled times.  As soon as the time for 
the post's display comes around, and the first person loads WP, the 
cron's scheduled time will be earlier than the current time, and the 
pings/trackbacks should be fired off.  This pseudo-cron could run with 
one SQL query... SELECT * FROM `wp_cron` WHERE `time` < '$now';

I agree that firing off trackbacks to a non-existent entry is bad.  In 
fact, it's behavior that will get you blacklisted in many places.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_specialchars() and HTML Entities
Message-ID: <1959130b05050819546b14535c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need clarification on the intention of wp_specialchars(). On the first 
line of the function (/wp-includes/functions-formatting.php:99), there is a 
comment:

// Like htmlspecialchars except don't double-encode HTML entities

I'm not quite sure what "double-encoding" entails, and why it's undesirable.

I recently ran into a problem when I enter a person's name in the Link 
Editor that contains a special character such as ? as such: "Bj&ouml;rn". 
When I save the entry, it's saved to the database correctly, but upon 
editing again, the link name gets passed through wp_specialchars() and it 
disregards the character entity, giving me the literal "Bj?rn". I think this 
is pretty obviously undesirable behavior--a user wants to edit exactly what 
he inputted, not some converted version.

So my question is: what is the case where htmlspecialchars() [or 
htmlentities()] was overkill? What is this double-encoding and why is it 
bad? I'd like to come to a solution that prevents cases like the one I've 
experienced.

Thanks.

I believe double-encoding means that even if characters had already been 
converted, it converted certain characters again (IE &amp;ouml;).

I think that editing the characters not as their htmlspecialchars() 
counterpart is the intended behavior, that way people who use languages 
other than English regularly aren't editing htmlspecialchars() encoded 
strings. They are reencoded and stored in the database as the 
htmlspecialchars() counterparts.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Input type=password for protected posts
Message-ID: <74b84aa30505090105330143fe@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using Password protect blog posts a lot for personal posts. I was
following the discussion when someone suggested that password field
should be defined input type=password instead of text (with a counter
argument that when you're keying the password in the admin, you're
actually doing it in plain text).

The point is that someone can oversee what you're typing while
browsing (much less while logged in Admin console) like at home where
you have guests and you want to show some private excursion trips, but
do not want them to access from their homes) or you're using password
protect at work but someone may oversee your typing the password.

I guess, I've typed much more for a one-line/word change that I could
do it myself, but I guess, this may help propogate the idea towards
becoming part of the original download from WordPress.org.

You may want to ask on the Polyglots list, which is all about localized

Message-ID: <1115750708.29738.17.camel@portnoy.fuzzybelly.org>

With the advent of pluggable-functions.php, plugins cannot assume that
all core functions are loaded when the plugin is first run (Notably
get_currentuserinfo).  Plugins that call get_currentuserinfo() or other
pluggable functions during init should probably do their init in
response to the 'plugins_loaded' or 'init' actions rather than at plugin
load time.

Is this something new in 1.5.1?  If so, would have been nice to get advance 
warning out to plugin authors.  (At least, it's the first I've heard of 
it... don't know yet how it'll affect my stuff!) ;)

This in an effort to allow plugins to replace certain functionality, or in 
an effort to reduce loaded code?

This was discussed heavily on this list.

Allow plugins to replace certain functionality.

Sorry for breaking up the nice coversation, but a reminder for the future 
that such support questions should be posted on the support forums and you 
should check the Codex.

Is there any 1.5.1-rc2 planned, or should users be invited to fix
themselves?

I thought this was patched before 1.5.1 went to release? Perhaps it's
a problem in pre-release 1.5.1? I'm pretty sure it came up in the IRC
meetup when we were talking about last to-dos before release.

Reversing http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2584 solves the problem for me.

The patch that was suggested to make the caching more efficient actually 
accidentally ended up breaking things. This is pretty major and will 
necessitate another release, even though that's kind of embarassing.

Of course, but based on feedback from last week let's do it in 
#wordpress-meetup, still on Freenode. I'll post a reminder a few minutes 
before the event.

BTW, if you missed last week there's a great overview of it on the wiki:

Nevermind this, it isn't quite as thorough as I thought at first glance.

Yeah, that's a different issue that should probably be solved in
link_pages().  Diff attached.

I agree, Ryan. 
Assuming the intention is to publish date/time stamps as UTC then the
code is behaving correctly.

The RSS 2.0 standard (here
http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#optionalChannelElements )
explicitly states "All date-times in RSS conform to the Date and Time
Specification of RFC 822".
Which specification ( http://asg.web.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc822.html#sec-5.1 )
matches what we are using; though it allows any legitimate timezone.

May 11 16:08:50 photomatt Pplproof: it's on its fifth iteration or so, so 
it's getting fairly close to what I think will be the final logo
May 11 16:09:06 MCincubus photomatt, derivatives of the first logos you 
showed?
May 11 16:09:07 photomatt we did have some other community submissions, all 
of which were quite good
May 11 16:09:10 Semiologic Blackbird -- i can imagine :)
May 11 16:09:12 photomatt but didn't fit the project as well

May 11 16:09:52 photomatt the new logo is going to be more of an evolution 
rather than a completely new aesthetic
May 11 16:10:00 carthik photomatt, consider < WordPress /> too, if you will 
- simple, and in keeping with Semantic, Standards Compliant etc...
May 11 16:10:16 photomatt carthik: we actually had a submission that did 
that! maybe I can forward it to you
May 11 16:10:17 masquerade carthik, note quite, it has uppercases
May 11 16:10:21 Firas carthik: too geeky.. and chained to xml
May 11 16:10:41 photomatt what I do hope to be able to do is be able to find 
uses for the submitted logos, even if they're not the main WP look
May 11 16:10:42 masquerade s/note/not
May 11 16:10:55 Pplproof How many entry-level users are really going to 
"Get" that...?
May 11 16:11:03 twistedraisin alternate logos for possible prepackaged 
themes, matt?
May 11 16:11:06 masquerade photomatt, maybe post them for public display, 
and let theme authors include one that matches their theme well?
May 11 16:11:12 carthik like 6A has the 6 dots and the wrench(spanner), more 
than one could be good. Not everyone has to get it immediately...
May 11 16:11:30 MCincubus carthik, yeah. And AOL and the "A" and the "buddy 
guy"
May 11 16:11:38 photomatt my fav logos are things like FedEx, with the 
hidden arrow
May 11 16:11:50 skeltoac I noticed that very recently
May 11 16:11:58 MCincubus ... I totally never saw that
May 11 16:12:01 Firas hehe, photomatt wants a WP logo that you can spot on a 
truck 200ft away :D
May 11 16:12:09 photomatt the latest mockup also got a favorable review 
here: http://jefte.net/articles/wordpress-releases-1-5-1-and-logo-previews/
May 11 16:12:15 photomatt Firas: yes, think billboards and blimps :)
May 11 16:12:42 Heilemann Holy crap... There's a hidden arrow in there! Hah! 
Cool :D
May 11 16:13:02 photomatt the next suggested topic was changing the channel, 
which we already did
May 11 16:13:03 Pplproof The best logos can used equally effective in B&W, 
and can be used at ANY size...
May 11 16:13:03 photomatt so yay!
May 11 16:13:04 relle Side of an airplane....
May 11 16:13:07 skeltoac Wait, that's still the latest mockup? Nothing 
newer?
May 11 16:13:09 skippy may I ask why the W has a "bulb" on the right end in 
the logo? It looks ... odd.
May 11 16:13:12 ryanduff|laptop c'mon matt, you know you want it changed to 
"werd press" :P
May 11 16:13:18 photomatt skeltoac: nothing since last week
May 11 16:13:19 photomatt word.
May 11 16:13:43 photomatt skippy: it symbolizes what big heads we all have
May 11 16:13:52 Firas yeah, if opinions are counted, the bulb seems out of 
place
May 11 16:13:55 ColdForged O_o
May 11 16:13:55 skippy I didn't think you noticed!
May 11 16:14:07 carthik word.
May 11 16:14:13 carthik nice^^
May 11 16:14:23 carthik move on, though.
May 11 16:14:33 masquerade I don't necessarily "like" the bulb, but I think 
if it was removed it would look a little plain
May 11 16:14:42 Firas Possibility of assigning "positions or areas of 
responsiblity" for coordindation of the various Codex activities and 
assignments. Lorelle 22:39, 6 May 2005 (UTC)
May 11 16:14:45 photomatt as to the next topic, I'm open to more 
submissions, but probably the best designer time would go toward themes or 
coordiation with plugin authors
May 11 16:14:50 ryanduff|laptop it needs something, just not a bulb
May 11 16:14:51 Pplproof photomatt: If we're moving on, that's a subject I'd 
like to discuss more in-depth with you, if possible.
May 11 16:15:06 photomatt Pplproof: not necessary, what did you have in 
mind?
May 11 16:15:41 Pplproof Well, I'm just thinking a new user's first 
impressions to the logo...
May 11 16:15:52 Pplproof Choice of fonts, for instance.

May 11 16:16:10 kylev dude, XML-as-logo is sooooooo 2002!
May 11 16:16:11 Pplproof Sorry, slipping into "designer" mode here, so bear 
with me... ;)
May 11 16:16:40 Pplproof What sort of attitude are you trying to convey with 
it?
May 11 16:16:57 Pplproof "professional", "forward thinking", 
"progressive"...?
May 11 16:16:58 photomatt well if you look at logos in general
May 11 16:17:08 photomatt and logos of other companies/products in our space
May 11 16:17:12 Blackb|rd as fort the bulby W: it may become the "Wordpress 
W" which i turn makes it easy to have really tiny logos signifying WP stuff.
May 11 16:17:16 photomatt on one end you have blogger, ultra friendly
May 11 16:17:20 photomatt Blackb|rd: exactly
May 11 16:17:28 * Heilemann has quit ()
May 11 16:17:30 photomatt but Blogger is also a little comic-booky
May 11 16:17:37 photomatt they're like the Kia
May 11 16:17:45 photomatt we want to be the Lexus/Mercedes of blogging
May 11 16:17:48 MCincubus "Hey kids!!"
May 11 16:17:50 Pplproof Yes, they're designed to be ULTRA-accessible.
May 11 16:18:02 photomatt which I think is a good contrast to how FREE we 
are
May 11 16:18:04 relle photomatt: then the logo is perfect. The bulb in the 
middle looks like a car logo.
May 11 16:18:06 Pplproof You want to be the Lexus that still gets 50MPG...?
May 11 16:18:09 masquerade without the price
May 11 16:18:40 Blackb|rd and having decent typography also adds to a 
feeling of sophistication.
May 11 16:18:42 photomatt free but priceless
May 11 16:18:48 MCincubus The free Lexus that is yours to drive, if you 
don't mind a manual transmission.
May 11 16:18:50 factoryjoe photomatt: have you thought about the license on 
the font at all?
May 11 16:19:08 factoryjoe on problem with spreadfirefox was that everyone 
wants the FF Meta font...
May 11 16:19:18 factoryjoe which, b/c of copyright, we couldn't just give 
away...
May 11 16:19:22 photomatt factoryjoe: I'll probably end up buying it, I 
think it's < $30
May 11 16:19:23 factoryjoe mrs eaves is copyrighted
May 11 16:19:23 * h3h (prb@cpe-24-165-8-156.san.res.rr.com) has joined 
#wordpress-meetup
May 11 16:19:33 factoryjoe yeah, that's for your *your* license
May 11 16:19:40 relle he's right.
May 11 16:19:42 Firas oh i recognize factoryjoe
May 11 16:19:42 photomatt we could certainly distribute vectors of the logo
May 11 16:19:48 factoryjoe by comparison, the drupal font is open source
May 11 16:19:50 photomatt without sending out the whole font
May 11 16:19:51 Blackb|rd photomatt: I think he meant for the countless ppl 
who want do acfepress T-Shirts
May 11 16:19:56 MCincubus yeah. you can't copyright fonts. Only the font 
files, I think.
May 11 16:19:58 factoryjoe photomatt: that's one option
May 11 16:20:14 photomatt after this is done I want so much schwag no one 
will know what to do
May 11 16:20:16 factoryjoe just wanted to make a note of that...
May 11 16:20:19 carthik photomatt, that would be nice and maybe even 
necessary
May 11 16:20:27 skeltoac shwag => ditto
May 11 16:20:27 photomatt not cafepress, maybe real shirts
May 11 16:20:28 skippy I didn't mean to hang us up on the bulb. It just 
seems incongruently curvy on an otherwise rigid serif character.
May 11 16:20:39 Blackb|rd photomatt: 'course, but you got what I meant
May 11 16:20:51 relle skippy: that's the contrast effect - it's a good 
thing.
May 11 16:21:00 photomatt speaking of shirts
May 11 16:21:02 * westi wants shwag too
May 11 16:21:07 Pplproof I have to agree with skippy on this.
May 11 16:21:08 Blackb|rd skippy: well, WP makes a difference, doesn't it?
May 11 16:21:12 skippy it strikes me as discordant, more than contrast.
May 11 16:21:20 photomatt we got an email a few days ago from 
http://www.spreadshirt.com/
May 11 16:21:24 factoryjoe i'm w/ skippy... 
May 11 16:21:25 photomatt they want to promote themselves to bloggers
May 11 16:21:27 h3h where's the new logo?
May 11 16:21:27 factoryjoe what??!
May 11 16:21:37 Blackb|rd could be a smaller bulb, agreed.
May 11 16:21:41 MCincubus h3h, http://photomatt.net/temp/
May 11 16:21:56 relle photomatt: I personally (experienced voice here) like 
it. I didn't at first, but I see the potential. Bulb alone, words alone, all 
together, t-shirts, swatches, billboards - blogs, blogrolls, lots of 
versatility. Good work. Remember, a lot of work goes into these things, 
folks. And a lot of thought.
May 11 16:21:57 Blackb|rd photomatt: German Co., IIRC
May 11 16:22:03 h3h hmm. what's the significance of the bulb?
May 11 16:22:05 skeltoac Shrink that bulb too much, Blackb|rd, and you lose 
the distinctiveness that it needs.
May 11 16:22:06 photomatt please don't link to that URL in blogs, that is a 
temporary spot

May 11 16:22:33 * Now talking on #wordpress-meetup
May 11 16:22:33 * Topic for #wordpress-meetup is: WordPress Weekly IRC 
Meetup | Wednesdays at 5PM EST
May 11 16:22:33 * Topic for #wordpress-meetup set by masq|coding at Wed May 
11 14:37:02 2005
May 11 16:22:41 Blackb|rd skippy: a complicated balance, agreed
May 11 16:22:48 carthik well what about spreadshirt, though, matt?
May 11 16:22:51 photomatt Opera uses spreadshirt for their US and EU stores
May 11 16:22:55 Pplproof The logo does a nice job of carrying that 
"professional" vibe, but it doesn't come across as very "accessible"... 
Serif fonts = Law firms, "elitist", etc.
May 11 16:23:14 Pplproof And it doesn't really have the distinction to stick 
in my mind.
May 11 16:23:22 photomatt and falls back to cafepress for other items
May 11 16:23:24 chuyskywalker wp_logo_4.00.gif -- makes me think of aviation 
for some reason. Wings, etc. 
May 11 16:23:25 westi from my experiences in doing t-shirts (I organised 
halls t-shirts at uni two years running) there pricing is reasonable too
May 11 16:23:36 photomatt westi: that's good to know
May 11 16:23:54 Semiologic personally i like the current logo. why in the 
world do we want to change it?
May 11 16:23:59 skippy how much are speradshirt shirts?
May 11 16:24:05 westi from memory for screen printing resale of 8-10 a 
tshirt is a good price
May 11 16:24:06 h3h are colors being considered for the new logo at all?
May 11 16:24:09 skeltoac Semio, not iconic enough.
May 11 16:24:19 photomatt I'm going to see if we can get a sample from them, 
if the quality looks good perhaps we can give them a spot on the forums for 
a month in exchange for a deal on shirts
May 11 16:24:23 westi skippy: 
http://www.spreadshirt.com/Products_and_Printin.17.0.html
May 11 16:24:31 Blackb|rd Pplproof: well, it's hard to both convey free 
(libre) and high-quality
May 11 16:24:39 photomatt h3h: haven't gotten to colors yet, just making it 
work in B/W first
May 11 16:24:45 h3h got it
May 11 16:24:47 carthik photomatt, I hope they do not end up having a 
monopoly though.
May 11 16:24:49 * citizenjim has quit ()
May 11 16:24:58 photomatt carthik: who?
May 11 16:25:01 carthik photomatt, what will be usage restrictions on the 
logo/brand be?
May 11 16:25:05 Firas Is WP going to be trademarked?
May 11 16:25:06 * h3h votes for the one on the top in 4.01
May 11 16:25:07 carthik photomatt, spreadshirt
May 11 16:25:29 Pplproof Blackb|rd: Not neccessarily... There's still a 
difference between high-quality, and "elitist". You can still have something 
that's "sophisticated", etc.
May 11 16:25:36 photomatt "WordPress" is being trademarked, yes
May 11 16:25:47 photomatt it needs to be for protection, as
wordpress.com<http://wordpress.com>showed us
May 11 16:25:49 Firas which might create another problem that firefox is 
dealing with
May 11 16:25:56 Blackb|rd Pplproof: but it gets exceedingly difficult (not 
argueing: it's what we should aim for, but it's hard to do)
May 11 16:25:57 Firas yeah, i agree, it should be
May 11 16:26:03 factoryjoe yeah it's a tough nut to crack
May 11 16:26:12 factoryjoe (licensing that is)
May 11 16:26:16 Pplproof Blackb|rd: I certainly agree... But that's what I 
get paid to do. ;)
May 11 16:26:30 Blackb|rd Pplproof: then do it already! ;))
May 11 16:26:42 Pplproof Blackb|rd: That's why I was asking Matt! ;D
May 11 16:26:43 Pplproof lol
May 11 16:26:45 factoryjoe photomatt: i started a conversation w/ the 
creative commons guys about doing to trademark what they've done for 
copyright
May 11 16:26:53 MCincubus Yeah... if it's not going to even be considered, 
it's not worth his time.
May 11 16:26:54 factoryjoe glenn over there is v. interested
May 11 16:27:04 Firas that's very interesting
May 11 16:27:07 photomatt factoryjoe: that could be interesting
May 11 16:27:10 factoryjoe yes
May 11 16:27:17 Blackb|rd photomatt: I have to second Pplproof in that 
volunteer pros might have a few ideas that this large circle of poeple might 
overlook.
May 11 16:27:17 photomatt the current "stance" is
May 11 16:27:19 factoryjoe me and steven garrity brought it up last fall
May 11 16:27:26 factoryjoe when we first started having problems on SFX
May 11 16:27:40 photomatt don't use "wordpress" in your domain or site name, 
everything else is fair
May 11 16:27:54 factoryjoe that's the problem...
May 11 16:27:57 factoryjoe you can't just say that
May 11 16:28:07 factoryjoe the law doesn't allow you to if you're going to 
"protect it"
May 11 16:28:11 photomatt I know
May 11 16:28:12 Pplproof Identity-related matters are rarely (not to shut 
everyone out, just stating a fact I've dealt with before) something that are 
handled effectively by a committee.
May 11 16:28:12 factoryjoe hence we need an alternative
May 11 16:29:07 Blackb|rd Pplproof: I have the vision that WP might want to 
be to Blogging what LaTeX is to papers/articles in academia.
May 11 16:29:16 factoryjoe in any case, this is real issue to consider 
sooner than later as you move fwd w/ trademark
May 11 16:29:26 factoryjoe roping the CC guys in now would be smart I think
May 11 16:29:29 photomatt I think that's good for this week w/r/t identity, 
let's talk about it again next week though
May 11 16:29:33 factoryjoe I can do intros if you want...
May 11 16:29:46 Blackb|rd photomatt: ack. let's move on.
May 11 16:29:49 factoryjoe just lemme know
May 11 16:30:14 Firas i'm nobody but i'd recommend that photomatt and cc 
hookup in this trademark issue :D
May 11 16:30:22 MCincubus I move that we move to 1.5.1 => 1.5.2 discussion.
May 11 16:30:30 twistedraisin not true, firas, your plugin kicks ass.
May 11 16:30:31 photomatt Firas: I'll follow up on that
May 11 16:30:33 masquerade Firas, that's what factoryjoe was recommending
May 11 16:30:35 photomatt MCincubus: let's save that for last
May 11 16:30:36 skippy I second MCincubus 
May 11 16:30:44 skippy darn
May 11 16:30:48 skippy too slow.
May 11 16:31:02 RandyWalker lol
May 11 16:31:06 Firas ok, want next codex item now?
May 11 16:31:07 photomatt maybe the topic by Lorelle now
May 11 16:31:08 photomatt is she here?
May 11 16:31:15 relle here
May 11 16:31:28 RandyWalker no Lo ?
May 11 16:31:29 RandyWalker :)
May 11 16:31:35 relle Possibility of assigning "positions or areas of 
responsiblity" for coordindation of the various Codex activities and 
assignments.
May 11 16:31:38 photomatt relle: What did you have in mind?
May 11 16:31:40 relle no lo ;-)
May 11 16:31:46 RandyWalker :-D
May 11 16:32:13 photomatt more specifically, what responsibilities do you 
think need assigning
May 11 16:32:16 relle The Codex is really tightening up and I'd like to see 
some responsiblity assigned to volunteers to coordinate efforts.
May 11 16:32:28 relle After the name of the admin, I'd like to see areas of 
responsibility.
May 11 16:32:38 twistedraisin what do you need the volunteers to do?
May 11 16:32:50 relle So if someone comes in and is a plugin expert, I would 
know to send them to X who is in charge of plugin information on the codex.
May 11 16:33:02 relle If someone wants to help with Lessons, they would know 
that this is my baby.
May 11 16:33:05 ryanduff|laptop who let RandyWalker in here :P
May 11 16:33:05 RandyWalker relle: are you saying, like "So and so: you're 
in charge of Templating, Whatshisname is in charge of Installation" etc?
May 11 16:33:13 relle Something like that.
May 11 16:33:16 RandyWalker ryanduff|laptop: I've been in here :P
May 11 16:33:31 relle A lot of people come in and say I want to help, I'm 
good at X and then they are ignored.
May 11 16:33:31 photomatt I don't know if the docs team is big enough for 
that
May 11 16:33:53 relle Why not?
May 11 16:33:56 skippy at a high-level, I think it would work.
May 11 16:34:04 Semiologic relle: i think a better approach would be to 
simply making it more obvious who is maintaining the codex
May 11 16:34:08 relle Already people like macmanx handle themes and plugins 
- so why not say so on the list.
May 11 16:34:20 relle Obvious is good and that is in the works.
May 11 16:34:23 Semiologic and to list where contributors write
May 11 16:34:30 relle BINGO!
May 11 16:34:37 relle They are just a list of names.

May 11 16:35:01 photomatt this list? 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Special:Listadmins
May 11 16:35:02 Semiologic if you say so: i wouldn't even know where to find 
the said list in the codex
May 11 16:35:04 photomatt that page isn't editable
May 11 16:35:05 carthik I think the way it works now is fine: we have a few 
SysOps admins, clearly listed, and I just edited the few pages introducing 
the Codex to new volunteers that those are the people to contact in case of 
confusion, as also sending a mail to the wp-docs list.
May 11 16:35:33 relle The new http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Tasks Task 
List Carthik and I put together is ready and waiting for people to sign up 
and get involved and I'd like to see people help direct the efforts.
May 11 16:35:40 * Amazon

May 11 16:36:19 photomatt I think we have a overuse of the stubs like 
{{Copyedit}}
May 11 16:36:20 relle photomatt: yes, that list or something like it.
May 11 16:36:32 * chrisjdavis has quit ()
May 11 16:36:32 photomatt if those were more judiciously applied perhaps 
they could be used more to direct efforts
May 11 16:36:37 twistedraisin I don't mind volunteering, I just haven't been 
sure where my effort is needed as of yet.
May 11 16:36:44 ringmaster Well if people would actually *Edit Copy* that 
wouldn't be an issue...
May 11 16:37:00 relle twistedraisin, that's a great example of what I'm 
getting at.
May 11 16:37:05 carthik photomatt, the page you linked to has a template 
that can be edited, to add leading text, before the list itself.
May 11 16:37:23 relle If people know that Lorelle is in charge of Lessons - 
then they could leave a message on my user page and I could direct their 
energies.
May 11 16:37:46 skippy relle: your user page was intimidatingly cluttered 
last time I looked at it.
May 11 16:37:52 relle I'm not talking about corporate bureacracy here, just 
some info.
May 11 16:37:55 skippy I wasn't sure leaving you a message would produce 
meaningful results.
May 11 16:38:07 relle Hit the discussion page to leave a message.
May 11 16:38:07 photomatt maybe if the 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Contributing page could have a better call 
to action
May 11 16:38:08 Firas i almost just suggested that the codex should have a 
wiki
May 11 16:38:18 RandyWalker Firas: uhhh
May 11 16:38:19 photomatt discussion should probably *mostly* happen over 
the docs list
May 11 16:38:23 westi Firas: but that wiki would need a codex!
May 11 16:38:27 photomatt as following discussion on the wiki is horrid
May 11 16:38:35 relle It puts a big YOU HAVE MESSAGES on the site when I 
visit. Always post messages in the User discussion area.
May 11 16:38:39 carthik photomatt, I am open to improving that page, however 
it's possible.
May 11 16:38:41 masquerade While on the wiki, why not set it as a redirect 
to the codex?
May 11 16:39:03 relle photomatt, the Contributing page has been totally 
redone in the past few days by Carthik and it's MUCH better.
May 11 16:39:05 MCincubus There is some really old 1.2 stuff on wiki that 
could actually be doing harm.
May 11 16:39:16 photomatt on wiki.wordpress.org <http://wiki.wordpress.org>?
May 11 16:39:20 relle Yes.
May 11 16:39:24 * MCincubus nods
May 11 16:39:27 photomatt ideally the relevant articles should redirect to 
the new wiki
May 11 16:39:34 photomatt phpwiki supports external redirects
May 11 16:39:35 carthik photomatt, on the subject of {{Templates}} I made a 
list at http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Maintenance which are the ones 
intended for use, and none else. I think the set is optimal for use
May 11 16:39:38 relle Some great stuff that is still in the works to be 
moved to the new Codex, but harmful stuff too.
May 11 16:39:59 skippy relle: I was speaking about your discussion page. 
It's so full that I wasn't sure _my_ discussion would generate any activity, 
and would be lost in the shuffle.
May 11 16:40:16 photomatt relle: perhaps the task for the next few weeks 
could be transitioning the old wiki more finally
May 11 16:40:18 relle Skippy, just add a note to the bottom. I'll look at 
cleaning it up later.
May 11 16:40:23 carthik skippy, relle, I move old discussions into sub pages 
of my Talk page - might help
May 11 16:40:26 relle Sure.
May 11 16:40:28 masquerade I'd recommend setting
wiki.wordpress.org<http://wiki.wordpress.org>to point to the codex,
and have a special subdomain where the docs team
could get to the wiki to transfer new information older
May 11 16:40:48 skippy carthik: good idea. *I* know how it works, but a new 
contributor might feel even more overwhelmed than me.
May 11 16:40:54 photomatt masquerade: there are still lots of links to pages 
there, the pages themselves should redirect, not the whole subdomain
May 11 16:41:56 photomatt relle: would you like to be the person who assigns 
incoming <strike>victims</strike> volunteers to the codex?
May 11 16:42:18 relle Hmmmm.
May 11 16:42:33 relle I'll think about it.
May 11 16:42:49 MCincubus http://codex.wordpress.org/Put_me_in_coach ;-)
May 11 16:43:05 RandyWalker I wanna work on the Codex too
May 11 16:43:11 relle I think that anyone could push someone towards an area 
IF THEY KNEW WHO DID WHAT.
May 11 16:43:25 carthik RandyWalker, did you really that just now? ;)
May 11 16:43:47 Firas relle: start a page on the community area?
May 11 16:43:54 Firas where people can sign up to be topic leaders
May 11 16:43:58 relle RandyWalker: 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Community_Portal
May 11 16:44:01 Firas who you can get in touch with
May 11 16:44:02 photomatt relle: people can put their interests on their 
forum profile
May 11 16:44:03 carthik relle, but basically, what is the need for such 
specialization, considering the volunteer nature of the effort and all.
May 11 16:44:06 RandyWalker carthik had me working on some stuff a while 
ago. but the codex is kinda overwhelming. I need specifics on wat to do..
May 11 16:44:10 RandyWalker carthik: eh?
May 11 16:44:19 relle Directed effort.
May 11 16:44:35 relle Randy and twistedraisin gave good examples: I want to 
help but I don't know what to do.
May 11 16:44:43 carthik RandyWalker, the Codex:Contributing page defines 
things you can do, almost all the things, in a hopefully simple straight 
fashion
May 11 16:44:44 relle I don't know who to turn to. I don't know where to go. 
Who to ask.
May 11 16:45:02 RandyWalker these pages are hard to find...
May 11 16:45:04 photomatt relle: would the docs list be a good place to 
start?
May 11 16:45:14 relle Sure.
May 11 16:45:21 relle This is what I would do if I were in charge of the 
world.
May 11 16:45:25 carthik relle, consider this, there is no list about which 
dev is responsible for what part of WP's code, for one.
May 11 16:45:32 relle Make a list of the areas covered by who.
May 11 16:45:32 photomatt relle: perhaps with shorter, more direct messages. 
before I've had trouble with the length of what you were writing, personally 
:)
May 11 16:46:01 relle Then if you find someone with an interest, shove them 
towards that person.
May 11 16:46:09 twistedraisin relle: Well I signed up for something minor 
for now
May 11 16:46:11 relle What messages?
May 11 16:46:14 carthik ...who might be busy, relle :)
May 11 16:46:16 relle Thanks. Great.
May 11 16:46:38 photomatt well I think an interests page would be a good 
idea
May 11 16:46:41 Semiologic Lorelle: why can't this be a heat map?
May 11 16:46:49 relle What be a heat map?
May 11 16:46:54 photomatt lik relle suggested, let people put their name and 
their expertise
May 11 16:47:03 factoryjoe sounds like 43things
May 11 16:47:05 photomatt and then anyone can route. is that the idea?
May 11 16:47:09 photomatt factoryjoe: damn hippie
May 11 16:47:10 Semiologic for instance, you could use the existing 
'categories' as tags, and draw a heat map of where contributors write
May 11 16:47:13 relle YES!
May 11 16:47:13 factoryjoe haha
May 11 16:47:32 relle Heat map = clutter.
May 11 16:47:35 Firas you'd need to keep track of that though
May 11 16:47:41 carthik oh please don't talking about mediawiki hacking, now 
:)
May 11 16:47:43 Firas mediawiki is not something that can be easily hacked 
into is it
May 11 16:47:48 Semiologic the only thing that would be required would be to 
tag pages some bit
May 11 16:47:50 Firas carthik: jinx :)
May 11 16:47:56 factoryjoe 
http://flickr.com/photos/factoryjoe/11118526/in/set-272946/
May 11 16:48:08 Semiologic speaking of mediawiki -- why isn't the codex 
running wordpress? :)
May 11 16:48:18 relle OKay, so carthik and I will work on a list asking 
people to list their interest and involvement in the Codex for others to 
seek out.
May 11 16:48:28 Firas 'coz WP isn't the best tool for a wiki?
May 11 16:48:31 masquerade Quick suggestion: anyone care to extend the 
meeting, as there are quite a few more topics that I doubt can be covered in 
10 minutes
May 11 16:48:32 carthik Semiologic, WordPress is not a collaborative editing 
tool.
May 11 16:48:43 jonabad i second masquerade
May 11 16:48:51 twistedraisin Semiologic: wordpress is a blogging, not wiki, 
tool
May 11 16:49:02 carthik relle, we both can't - each person will have to 
speak for themselves, pretty much.
May 11 16:49:36 relle "I" will work on a list that will INVITE people to 
sign up with their interst and involvement in the Codex.
May 11 16:49:37 Firas if we need to keep time deadlines then we need a 
secretary-type or something to move us along (even photomatt), if not the 
meeting should just keep going until it exhausts...
May 11 16:50:08 relle That should help direct people to who does what and to 
find out how to help.
May 11 16:50:10 Semiologic carthik: i find it amazingly rich so far, as a 
cms. wiki is just a few steps away

May 11 16:50:29 masquerade I agree with Firas, and I know that it was 
previously mentioned to be ending at 5, which is hardly long enough 
apparently
May 11 16:50:34 carthik Semiologic, evolve till you check mail (old joke, I 
know) :)
May 11 16:50:43 relle I'm done.
May 11 16:50:58 photomatt masquerade: I think we could add 30 minutes and 
cover everything
May 11 16:51:02 twistedraisin thanks for your input, relle.

May 11 16:52:00 Firas Timeline for an RSS Patch/1.5.2 (jonabad)
May 11 16:52:51 twistedraisin Ryan was nailing down patch stuff for RSS 
today, I think. Matt had mentioned a few other things worth taking care of 
before the next dot release went out
May 11 16:52:53 photomatt the plan is to get the confirmed patches in the 
source ASAP
May 11 16:52:54 MCincubus Also, Any other things that should be fit into 
1.5.2 release? --MCincubus
May 11 16:53:01 photomatt MCincubus: I'd say no
May 11 16:53:29 photomatt I think getting the fixes out sooner is more 
important
May 11 16:53:54 mikelittle What about the SQL errors here? 
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1331 
May 11 16:53:59 * westi agrees getting out a bug fix only release soon is 
important
May 11 16:54:06 jonabad photomatt, superfast like this weekend?
May 11 16:54:07 MCincubus What's the deal with the Ping-O-Matic problems 
people have been complaining about?
May 11 16:54:10 photomatt mikelittle: that's fine
May 11 16:54:47 MCincubus Unable to ping Ping-o-Matic 
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1325
May 11 16:54:58 photomatt MCincubus: I believe it has to do with extended 
pings
May 11 16:55:31 MCincubus worth fixing or not?
May 11 16:55:43 MCincubus for 1.5.2, I mean.
May 11 16:55:45 photomatt MCincubus: already fixed
May 11 16:55:53 photomatt it was a prob in PoM, not WP
May 11 16:56:15 MCincubus Oh cool... then that bug can be closed.
May 11 16:56:39 photomatt done
May 11 16:56:49 twistedraisin 1324,1325,1331, 1323, how about the paging 
bug, we can nail that one into 1.5.2 right?
May 11 16:56:50 mikelittle Matt has wordpress.org
<http://wordpress.org>just died? Getting access refused
May 11 16:56:50 MCincubus RSS stuff is just a rollback?
May 11 16:57:01 photomatt no, the problem was the rollback
May 11 16:57:03 twistedraisin ryan schlogged that one down today I think.
May 11 16:57:05 relle mikelittle: no.
May 11 16:57:10 photomatt it's a change in the rolled-back logic
May 11 16:57:10 relle I'm on it and it's fine.

May 11 16:57:20 masquerade anyone know if skippy submitted the bug report on 
plugin hooks and posting?
May 11 16:57:22 photomatt have no problem getting to
wordpress.org<http://wordpress.org>here
May 11 16:57:25 MCincubus masquerade, he did
May 11 16:57:34 * masquerade thinks that should be fixed in 1.5.2
May 11 16:57:49 twistedraisin gotta catch a train, later.
May 11 16:57:49 ryanduff|laptop mikelittle: no peoblems here
May 11 16:57:54 * twistedraisin is now known as Provos|T
May 11 16:57:59 MCincubus Would be nice... especially since it enables 
Skippy's plugin to do future-dated pings!
May 11 16:58:02 photomatt okay people chill
May 11 16:58:03 ryanduff|laptop ringmaster|home: welcome
May 11 16:58:14 photomatt there aren't two bugs that will be fixed
May 11 16:58:29 ringmaster|home Hello ryan! Hello again, work self!
May 11 16:58:35 mikelittle my bad. firewall/web cache died!
May 11 16:58:39 photomatt if it's in the bug tracker and isn't a feature, 
and can be fixed soon, then it should work in 1.5.2
May 11 16:59:22 photomatt mostly we need testing and more reporting
May 11 16:59:52 ringmaster|home I think a major part of the problem with the 
1.5.1 release is that there weren't enough testers.
May 11 16:59:54 photomatt the one thing I'm not sure about is the reported 
pingback/trackback problems by people like macmanx
May 11 17:00:07 photomatt ringmaster: I don't think there's enough variety 
of testers
May 11 17:00:15 ringmaster|home On this, I also agree.
May 11 17:00:23 photomatt the pb/tb problem is so sporadic I have no idea 
what it could be, could be his host
May 11 17:00:24 * h3h recommends 
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1306 for 1.5.2 (simple fix)
May 11 17:00:37 photomatt ringmaster: I saw you did a pb/tb tester, any 
results from that?
May 11 17:00:52 RandyWalker ok, I'm going to shit, shower, and shave :)
May 11 17:00:56 RandyWalker this was fun
May 11 17:01:02 RandyWalker ta ta :)
May 11 17:01:05 ringmaster|home Well, I didn't try it on his site, but I 
tried pingin his site from mine today, and it didn't work.
May 11 17:01:16 RandyWalker (you can remove that from the transcripts if you 
want)
May 11 17:01:19 * RandyWalker (~randy@207.72.44.28 <http://207.72.44.28>) 
has left #wordpress-meetup
May 11 17:01:30 MCincubus could it be that he doesn't have URL fopen or 
CURL?
May 11 17:01:34 photomatt I think macmanx just has a funky host or 
something, if we can identify anything broader that would help
May 11 17:01:44 photomatt he's on BlueHost, which was recently removed from 
the hosting page
May 11 17:01:59 photomatt MCincubus: no because I was able to send him a 
pingback yesterday
May 11 17:02:46 ringmaster|home Maybe a firewall issue? Or perhaps the 
script times out? Any number of crazy things could be the culprit.
May 11 17:03:29 skeltoac CURL is often thwarted by the host's proxy. GoDaddy 
had one and their tech support couldn't help me get through it.
May 11 17:03:54 skeltoac In the end I upgraded my account just to enable 
fsockopen.
May 11 17:03:59 photomatt people on godaddy hosting are almost hopeless
May 11 17:04:39 skeltoac I'm on a month-to-month basis with them until I can 
afford better.
May 11 17:04:46 michel_v perhaps we could have some way to make pingback not 
check for accuracy and excerpt
May 11 17:04:55 michel_v and instead place the pingback in moderation queue
May 11 17:05:11 MCincubus hm... so... fopen, CURL, moderation?
May 11 17:05:13 photomatt michel_v: they go in moderation queues anyway, and 
I would rather not open it up to spam like trackback
May 11 17:06:07 ringmaster|home Much of the problem is that these features 
are too transparent to debug. Most of it takes place after post.php kicks 
the user back out to the editing page.
May 11 17:06:41 photomatt which is on purpose, because they can be slow
May 11 17:06:57 ringmaster|home Yes. Although a constant that turns that off 
would be *superb*.
May 11 17:07:00 photomatt ideally we could do them in an iframe or similar 
after reload and show status
May 11 17:07:36 westi photomatt: iframe... nah you want AJAX ;)
May 11 17:07:53 ryanduff|laptop westi: I was just about to say that
May 11 17:08:05 photomatt all the same. google maps uses iframes to 
communicate with the server
May 11 17:08:35 Firas is JS a requirement to successfully admin? (i don't 
care either way, just checking)
May 11 17:08:43 photomatt okay, how about internationalized support now?
May 11 17:08:45 photomatt Firas: nope
May 11 17:08:50 ringmaster|home Something that shows the status of the 
pings/trackback after the page reloads would be very user-friendly.
May 11 17:09:00 westi you can do some cool stuff with auto refreshing 
IFRAMEs and some simple JS
May 11 17:09:15 h3h photomatt: note that iframes add an item to the user's 
history, so pressing the Back button would bring about a seemingly undesired 
result. food for though.
May 11 17:09:18 h3h thought.
May 11 17:09:36 westi h3h: do they.. i've not seen that
May 11 17:09:40 photomatt h3h: the point was how it's implemented isn't 
important, just the idea
May 11 17:09:54 h3h i know :) just ensuring clarity going in.
May 11 17:09:54 photomatt neuro`: did you want to say something about 
internationalization?
May 11 17:10:36 ringmaster|home What's the bid deal with i18n, then?
May 11 17:10:51 ringmaster|home s/bid/big
May 11 17:10:59 h3h westi: aye. see [ 
http://beta.xkr.us/js-iframe-location.html ]. click on any link in the 
frame, then click your back button.
May 11 17:12:02 Firas is neuro` there?
May 11 17:12:06 westi h3h: i would say that is correct behaviour
May 11 17:12:11 Firas or we can just move it to next meeting
May 11 17:12:21 photomatt ringmaster: not sure what neuro` wanted to bring 
up, let's put it off for now
May 11 17:12:32 ringmaster|home Ok. :)
May 11 17:12:41 h3h westi: agreed. the point was to beware of that behavior 
if one is to use a hidden iframe to accomplish a task such as monitoring 
[ping|track]backs.
May 11 17:12:54 photomatt eventually there will be i18n version of the 
wordpress.org <http://wordpress.org> website itself on subdomains, but that 
project needs some work
May 11 17:13:39 carthik so what's next?
May 11 17:13:40 Firas Conclude the professional support discussion started 
earlier (Carthik)
May 11 17:13:48 photomatt need some sort of content management system that 
can have a set structure and show english/translation side-by-side for the 
translators
May 11 17:14:13 carthik oh, d'oh, Firas...
May 11 17:14:20 Firas i'm making something like rosetta so if there's 
anything specific i can put into matt let me know
May 11 17:14:27 Firas http://firasd.org/inflexion/
May 11 17:15:06 masquerade or me
May 11 17:15:06 photomatt Firas: sounds like a good idea
May 11 17:15:15 Firas or masquerade
May 11 17:15:25 Firas ok, carthik
May 11 17:15:27 Firas it's your floor
May 11 17:16:18 photomatt professional support?
May 11 17:16:20 carthik maybe Matt wants to push that to the next meetup?
May 11 17:16:29 carthik too late... sorry :)
May 11 17:16:39 photomatt we've got a few minutes
May 11 17:16:54 photomatt carthik: what did you think was a good pickup 
point?
May 11 17:17:08 * ryanduff|laptop has quit ()
May 11 17:17:25 carthik The last time we stopped with the pros and cons of 
"acknowledging" or vouching for professionals who support WP
May 11 17:17:34 carthik and using the wp-pro list to fill this need
May 11 17:17:56 photomatt alright
May 11 17:18:06 photomatt I think OS projects have a natural reputation 
system
May 11 17:18:13 carthik I'd say we think about using the wp foundation to 
drive an effort where everyone can pitch in for the benefit of the 
foundation, and themselves.
May 11 17:18:18 * Blackb|rd (klausman@eric.schwarzvogel.de) has left 
#wordpress-meetup
May 11 17:18:49 carthik I'd think a WP directed professional support system 
is better than "just letting it happen"
May 11 17:19:13 carthik and organized, planned setup is more likely to 
succeed.
May 11 17:19:19 Semiologic you could set up a bounty system :)
May 11 17:19:24 photomatt well at some point I could envision there being 
full time WP employees
May 11 17:19:35 chuyskywalker Semiologic: like google answers...
May 11 17:19:50 Semiologic 
http://www.semiologic.com/open-source-business-model/
May 11 17:19:52 Semiologic like the above link, actually
May 11 17:20:08 Pplproof May I interject something here...?
May 11 17:20:09 photomatt Semiologic: yes, read that
May 11 17:20:10 Semiologic i'm sure plenty of indians will flock to do 
support
May 11 17:20:14 photomatt Pplproof: sure
May 11 17:20:21 carthik photomatt, till we get there, we could have a 
forum/place where people can submit requests for jobs, which can be assigned 
to bounty hunters, who will be rated for the way they completed assigned 
work.
May 11 17:20:29 Firas Semiologic: wtf
May 11 17:20:29 carthik moderated by a few
May 11 17:21:07 Pplproof A number of members of the WP community have been 
discussing that very idea lately, actually...
May 11 17:21:40 Semiologic Firas: want paid support in the forums, or not? 
if you want some, a bounty system could work. e.g. paypal $1 for whever 
fixes this. a US citizen won't care. an indian might care.
May 11 17:22:05 Firas semiologic: ok, ok, that statement just rubbed me 
wrong, sorry
May 11 17:22:07 carthik Semiologic, why specifically Indians, though, I 
wonder :)
May 11 17:22:11 * Firas is indian
May 11 17:22:30 Pplproof We've been working on developing an open source 
business model that's a seperate entity entirely, yet still linked to 
WordPress, offering professional-quality themes as well as paid support.
May 11 17:22:31 MCincubus India is a great place to outsource tech work... 
that's all.
May 11 17:22:31 carthik nevermind, so what are your thoughts, Matt?
May 11 17:22:44 * westi looks at the clock and realises them time
May 11 17:22:48 westi night all
May 11 17:22:54 * westi is now known as westi|gone
May 11 17:22:54 carthik nite, westi
May 11 17:22:59 Semiologic carthik: my experience is that ukrainians and 
russians program better (i work a lot with both). but idians are cool too, 
and speak better english :)
May 11 17:23:17 photomatt there has been some question about whether plugins 
and/or themes can be non-GPL if distributed
May 11 17:23:33 Firas photomatt: hmm
May 11 17:23:37 MCincubus Is there a definitive answer?
May 11 17:23:39 Pplproof photomatt: Of particular importance to you, 10% of 
all money we bring in will be donated directly to WordPress development.
May 11 17:24:27 carthik photomatt, I figure there is nothing stopping them 
from being non-GPL legally.
May 11 17:24:38 photomatt MCincubus: I think a good argument could be made 
for them being virally GPL
May 11 17:24:46 photomatt since they link lots of internal WP GPL code
May 11 17:24:50 Pplproof photomatt: We've got a solution to that too.
May 11 17:24:54 Pplproof :D
May 11 17:24:58 MCincubus or sometimes take it, modify it, and stick it in.
May 11 17:25:01 photomatt Pplproof: who's "we"?
May 11 17:25:07 * Firas is in this thing with pplproof and masquerade and a 
few others, so is very interested
May 11 17:25:22 Firas pplproof: he means a legal issue at release time
May 11 17:25:39 carthik ( Semiologic, that's interesting to learn :) )
May 11 17:26:03 * Jason__
(~TheJason@12-217-255-187.client.mchsi.com<http://12-217-255-187.client.mchsi.com>)
has joined #wordpress-meetup
May 11 17:26:07 photomatt I personally don't mind people developing paid 
themes/plugins
May 11 17:26:14 photomatt I think it could be a healthy ecosystem
May 11 17:26:15 Pplproof photomatt: Firas, Jenn, Robert (Masquerade), etc...
May 11 17:26:45 ringmaster|home But the result should be GPL-licensed, even 
if the initial work is paid.
May 11 17:26:54 Pplproof Instead of having seperate resources however, 
bringing them under one umbrella.
May 11 17:26:59 Pplproof No doubt.
May 11 17:27:01 Semiologic matt: based on the market study I conducted from 
my site, I think there's plenty room for hosted wordpress as well
May 11 17:27:04 photomatt ringmaster: that's been everything I've done
May 11 17:27:14 photomatt Semiologic: hosted WP is definitely a direction 
we're headed in
May 11 17:27:26 Firas photomatt, is there anyone you can talk to about 
whether they can be (c) or not? to kinda help a demarcated line for people 
thinking of business models around WP
May 11 17:27:31 carthik ringmaster, but there is ne legal requirement that 
states that, I should think.
May 11 17:27:47 Semiologic send me a notice if you do -- I'm seriously 
considering a wp business
May 11 17:27:53 MCincubus you can modify it for private use and not have to 
share anything.
May 11 17:28:01 photomatt Firas: I'm not a lawyer, and I don't really know 
any
May 11 17:28:06 Firas ok
May 11 17:28:10 photomatt it probably wouldn't hurt sending a note to the 
FSF
May 11 17:28:19 relle photomatt: Get to know some lawyers VERY FAST.
May 11 17:28:34 Firas i'll find out
May 11 17:29:14 photomatt alright, might be worth reporting back next week
May 11 17:29:19 carthik There was a discussion on Alex King's site once 
about a Mambo Module, GPL and such, might be of interest, Firas.
May 11 17:29:27 relle There are volunteer legal organizations dedicated to 
helping "artists" and WordPress might slip in to that realm. They are 
experts in copyright, trademark, protection, and so on. Right up WP's alley.
May 11 17:29:38 relle I'll email you a list next week.
May 11 17:29:44 Pplproof relle: I've been looking into that actually. :)
May 11 17:29:51 relle Then you send him the list.
May 11 17:29:55 carthik photomatt, but what about prof. support, any 
thoughts, to conclude?
May 11 17:31:05 photomatt carthik: I think it's something to continue to 
pursue, maybe a good first step would to get a list of people who would like 
to do professional support
May 11 17:31:18 MCincubus Codex?
May 11 17:31:22 photomatt and start a discussion amoung that group as to 
rates, donations, etc
May 11 17:31:40 carthik photomatt, maybe a mail (from you) on hackers?
May 11 17:31:59 carthik a page at the codex, if necessary to keep track.
May 11 17:32:40 Semiologic projects don't survive on donations. you need a 
more regular stream of cash than that.
May 11 17:32:57 Firas make wp-pro more obvious
May 11 17:33:11 Firas basically, i've seen many people come into irc and 
ask, where can i get professionals for wp?
May 11 17:33:20 carthik Firas, that was one of the options consider 
(inconclusively) the last time.
May 11 17:33:22 relle On the forum constantly.
May 11 17:33:22 Firas anything to help the two groups conect would be great
May 11 17:33:23 MCincubus Yeah... I'm sure that in exchange for a nice 
open-market for WP work, hosted on a wp.org <http://wp.org> site, devs would 
be willing to promise a cut go back to WP
May 11 17:33:25 Semiologic there's a wp-pro list?
May 11 17:33:38 Pplproof Exactly my point.
May 11 17:33:38 Pplproof :/
May 11 17:33:51 carthik Yeah, for now, perhaps, you could point the souls at 
wp-pro?
May 11 17:34:12 carthik but that may "stick" too hard :)
May 11 17:34:40 Firas So, what's the resoultion
May 11 17:34:43 photomatt carthik: I'll send a message out to hackers
May 11 17:34:45 chuyskywalker And I can imagine resistance to joining an 
emai llist to get the help
May 11 17:34:48 MCincubus http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists
May 11 17:34:51 Firas how are we going to connect freelancers + people 
looking for work
May 11 17:34:53 * Provos|T is now known as twistedraisin
May 11 17:35:05 Firas photomatt: maybe to wp.org/dev <http://wp.org/dev>blog?
May 11 17:35:16 carthik photomatt, Firas, so that will be the temporary 
resolution - and exploration of what it might entail by mailing wp-hackers.
May 11 17:35:30 MCincubus Best solution: forum specialized for this use.
May 11 17:35:35 carthik s/and/an
May 11 17:36:13 photomatt professional support is much more significant in 
the enterprise space
May 11 17:36:37 Firas good point
May 11 17:36:39 carthik right, and for that you need some staff and 
employees.
May 11 17:36:52 michel_v it's also more time and resources consuming
May 11 17:36:53 Firas MCIncubus' idea is good
May 11 17:37:02 Firas make a forum or a section on the wp forums
May 11 17:37:10 relle I'm for that.
May 11 17:37:20 photomatt the last thing we need is more clutter on the 
forums
May 11 17:37:26 relle Or a reference list on the Codex, then.
May 11 17:37:31 MCincubus New forum, I'd say.
May 11 17:37:39 carthik While on forums, I was, and am a part of 
http://blogbarter.com - which is just such a forum - not too popular though 
with WP users as with MT users...

Message-ID: <4282DF54.7050503@cornell.edu>

Hackers, et omnis,

I've released WP-Hashcash 2.0, which should be more than sufficient to 
kill spambots for the rest of the year.  It improves usability and 
no-javascript detection, has 60% less javascript code, only uses 1 
installation file, and works harder to mask its own signature.  Also, 
the logging functions that were broken in the 1.5 branch have been 
fixed.  It is compatible with all versions of WP from 1.2 on, 
automatically detecting functionality it can / can't use.  You can get 
it here:

http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2005/05/11/wordpress-hashcash-20/

Suggestions for improvement, etc, are welcome!

Perhaps a zip or tarball file to download, rather than having to go  
through Trac?

Since all you need is the wp-hashcash.php file, there's a direct 
download link there, too:

http://dev.wp-plugins.org/file/wp-hashcash/trunk/wp-hashcash.php?rev=1708&format=raw

Yes this works.  But it's not that end-uer friendly.

It would also be nicer if you tagged the v2.0 release using the power of svn cp[1] so as to make it easier to know for
sure that as an end-user you are downloading the correct file.

 From the docs, it seems like tagging a 2.0 version copy would freeze 
it.  However, I've moved the 1.x version and copied the 2.x versions to 
appropriate tags, keeping the trunk as is:

I like it when folks use tags at wp-plugins.org.  Now you can download

0001351: quicktag "ins" and "del" format datetime attribute incorrectly
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1351

I just discovered this problem when I edited a post and added a new 
<ins> element. After fiddling with the javascript console, it appears 
that the Date.getTimezoneOffset() function is returning a positive 
number, even when the offset is negative (tested in Firefox 1.0.3 and IE6).

Additionally, when the offset is positive, we're not putting in the '+' 
symbol between the time and the timezone offset.

It's minor, but a bug's a bug :)

Message-ID: <42836BF2.6080806@copperleaf.org>

1) I'm working on a small plugin that requires an additional database 
table. Currently I'm using a query like

SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_mytable'

to check to see if my table already exists and create it if it doesn't. 
That seems expensive to me to do everytime my plugin is loaded so I was 
thinking about socking somthing away in wp_options that would let me 
know that I've already created it. I'm assuming that by the time an 
plugin code is executed that the options will have already been queried 
and cached.

What are others doing to accomplish this?

2) This may be more of a php question. There are occasions where I would 
like to perform a longer running task in the background (in terms of a 
minute or two, not hours). I realize that platform,webserver, php 
configuration can play a big role in what is possible. I've done some 
reading on using exec or system to perform background tasks. I've also 
thought of creating a php command line script that could be run from 
cron and check for work to be done. I was curious if anybody has some 
real world experience doing this with a plugin.

3) Last one... for the moment. :) In certain parts of my plugin, I'd 
like to restrict access to either the admin or users of a certain level. 
Is there a call that can tell me the users credentials so I can 
determine what they are allowed to do?

TIA,

Here's what I do in my subscribe2 plugin, which uses a custom table:
///////////////////////
function s2_install() {
// include upgrade-functions for maybe_create_table;
if (! function_exists('maybe_create_table')) {
        require_once(ABSPATH . '/wp-admin/upgrade-functions.php');
}

global $table_prefix;
$s2_table = $table_prefix . "subscribe2";
$s2_table_sql = "CREATE TABLE " . $s2_table .
     "( id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
     email varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
     active tinyint(1) default 0,
     PRIMARY KEY (id) )";

// create the table, as needed
maybe_create_table($s2_table, $s2_table_sql);

s2_reset();
} // s2_install

////////////////////
function s2_options() {
global $wpdb, $table_prefix, $cache_categories;

$s2_table = $table_prefix . "subscribe2";

// check if we need to install the table
$sql = "SELECT COUNT(id) FROM " . $s2_table;
// turn errors off, for the momemnt
$errors = $wpdb->hide_errors();
$foo = $wpdb->get_var($sql);
// turn errors back on
$errors = $wpdb->show_errors();
if ('' == $foo) { s2_install(); }
.... more stuff here....

get_currentuserinfo() usually works; though there might be some
complication now with the "pluggable functions" recently introduced.

It sounds like you just want to run a CREATE TABLE one time and never check 
for the table thereafter. You can look into my solution for this in Count My 
Clicks: http://wp-plugins.net/index.php?id=209
Synopsis: In the plugin's description, add a link to the plugin file with a 
special query string. Clicking that link in the Plugins admin page will 
initialize the plugin's tables, settings, or whatever. To make the plugin 
fail silently if the database is missing, you can use check a setting or a 
static file created by the plugin on initialization.

I'm using the cron table to call several PHP scripts at different intervals 
to update the database at http://blogsoftheday.com and some of those scripts 
can run for several minutes. It was shockingly easy to set up and it has not 
faltered once.

maybe_create_table() also uses SHOW TABLES, which is fine, but doesn't 
avoid that query if that's the intent.

Here's what I do:

class MyPlugin {
  $table_version = 1;
  function MyPlugin() {
   $this->settings = get_settings('MyPlugin');
   if($this->settings['table_version'] < $this->$table_version)
    $this->make_tables();
   //These also go here:
   // add_action('admin_menu', array(&$this, 'admin_menu'));
  }
  function make_tables() {
   global $table_prefix;
   if(!require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/upgrade-functions.php')) {
    die('Foolish plugin has added its own maybe_upgrade* functions');
   }
   $qry = "CREATE TABLE {$table_prefix}mytable (
    mytable_id BIGINT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    PRIMARY KEY  (mytable_id)
    );
    ";
   dbDelta($qry);
   $this->settings['table_version'] = $this->table_version;
   update_option('MyPlugin', $this->settings);
  }
}
$myplugin = new MyPlugin();

What benefit has all this?  If you change the table structure in an 
upgrade (add a field, change a field type, add an enum value, etc.), you 
simply increment the $table_version and the plugin will automatically 
upgrade the table.  Plus it's one less database hit if the options info 
is already cached.

I've been considering this type of thing myself, but my process is a 
series of repetitious function calls, each of which could take some 
length of time.  I'm considering adding a client-side reload hack for 
this issue, since the methods to extend allowed execution time for PHP 
executed from the web are not reliable enough for me, and provide no 
user feedback for the process.

get_currentuserinfo() works inside of functions that are executed from 
plugin hooks.  Do not attempt to call get_currentuserinfo() before all 
plugins are loaded.

It doesn't seem like the pluggable functions list is in the Codex.  Here 
it is:  get_currentuserinfo, get_userdata, get_userdatabylogin, wp_mail, 
wp_login, auth_redirect, wp_redirect, wp_setcookie, wp_clearcookie, 
wp_notify_postauthor, wp_notify_moderator

Calling any of those functions before all plugins are loaded will cause 
you problems.  This I know all too well.

I made use of my Download Manager requiring a settings entry in options 
as well as a separate 'tracking' table by having get_option() collect 
and test for the plugin's option, and when not there the plugin creates 
both it and the tracking table when the user adds their settings for the 
first time.

$user_level is global in admin pages.

Here is what I use, which I shall call the "fire query first, recurse
as needed" approach.

(Note: pseudo-code)

function queryWrapper($sql,$recurse=true) {

 if (($ret = doActualQuery($sql)) != null) {
   // success!
   return $ret;
 } elseif ($recurse && createTables()) {
   // recurse and try _once_ again on the
   // newly created tables
   return queryWrapper($sql, false);
 } else {
   // second attempt, or we couldn't create
   // tables: fail.
   die("couldn't create table!");
 }
}



Hope this makes sense!

I have tried fixing the .htaccess, tried disabling all the plugins,

Hi all,

I just realized that there is no option, or setting to turn off the
feeds generated by a WP blog.

Due to the way the wp-rss2.php etc files are constructed, at least one
post is delivered in the rss feed, even when the number of posts to be
displayed in the rss feed is set to a "0" in the Options->reading
page.

It would be great if someone could suggest a way a plugin (or a user)
can "turn off" the feeds for a blog, short of deleting the feed files.

Carthik.

Best solution seems like making a "0" shut the feeds down.  It should be 
easy to check for that at the start and die().

A "0" or a "-1" as long as it is documented.

Also, the file wp.php is a rogue :) since one does not have too much
control over it.
I rewrote a plugin today[1], and that's why I am concerned.

The user might have need to truncate your table directly. This wouldn't reset
any option you'd set in another table.

I pulled this from the online PHP manual:

function table_exists ($tablename, $db) {
  
   $result = mysql_list_tables($db);
   $rcount = mysql_num_rows($result);

   for ($i=0;$i<$rcount;$i++) {
       if (mysql_tablename($result, $i)==$tablename) return true;
   }
   return false;
}

Do you mean /page/(number)? I don't recall /paged/ ever being a
wordpress feature, although paged is the name of the query var that
/page/(number) redirects to (e.g. /page/3 redirects to /?paged=3)

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHP as cgi, SCRIPT_NAME errors
Message-ID: <80f75db050513095177a2e8a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/33564 is an example of the problem
produced when php is running as cgi. In this case, it appears that
$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] returns the cgi path rather than the required
file.

What's the best way to solve this, a search lead to beleive that using
$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] should fix it, but I cannot begin to work out
where all this will have to be changed :)

Could something be done about this in the source, like in
wp-settings.php or something?

Carthik.

The opposite is often true on IIS.  Fixes for this for IIS begin in 
wp-settings.php line 6, and it's centralized there by using the 
reassigned $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] throughout the source.

Yes, Owen, I knew and noticed that, which is why I ask if something
similar needs to be done to wp-settings.php to deal with this cgi
problem.

All are now listed as resolved except for:

wp-admin/post.php
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1347

http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1351

If we get get those committed, I'll be glad to start testing the whole

0001324: Unable to send/receive pingbacks and send trackbacks.
http://mosquito.wordpress.org/view.php?id=1324

This bug has a patch which will hopefully help with incoming pings.
Instead of using curl as the principal, this patch makes it a fallback
in the case where url fopen is not allowed.  If you're having problems
with incoming pings or if you're on Dreamhost or another host that
disallows url fopen, please try it out.

Matt committed the patch, so it will be available in the nightlies.

I just attached another patch that fixes url_to_postid().  It wasn't
working for some permalink structures.  If the pinged URI in an incoming
pingback cannot be resolved to a specific post, the ping is thrown on
the floor and error 33 is sent back.

The patch is a thorough rewrite of url_to_postid().  It uses pretty much
the same code we use to process permalinks coming in over PATH_INFO and
404 (see the top of wp-blog-header).  This code builds a query that is
then shipped to WP_Query.  If all goes well, WP_Query spits a matching
post back at us.

It was /page/#/ just like you said. Thank you David, but it seems that when 
I upgraded to Wordpress 1.5.1, it fixed itself. It seems there are no 
problems with my blog anymore and things are working perfectly. Thank you

If that's the case, are there any others that we want to get to 1.5.2?
And what are the steps to getting to 1.5.2?

Some months ago I encountered the same problem and I thought all

This is - I think - the 3rd such post with this problem. I'll try and

WordPress advertises "Full web standards compliance" as one of its 
features <http://wordpress.org/>. But if WordPress has problems with 
Google Web Accelerator, it is because WordPress is not in compliance 
with the HTTP 1.1 standard 
<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1>.

(In particular, WordPress is non-compliant for allowing GET requests to 
delete posts, comments, or pages, to select themes, or to activate 
plug-ins.)

Either WordPress should be brought into compliance, or the "Full 
standards compliance" bullet point should be removed. Blocking Google 
Web Accelerator to get around non-compliance with HTTP 1.1 would make as 
much sense as blocking validator.w3.org referrers to get around 
non-compliance with XHTML 1.0.

Standards or not, I agree that we should be blocking GWA - after all, if 
coders here are working hard to prevent unnecessary bandwidth use due to 
a dodgy feed, then blocking GWA from sucking in huge amounts of data 
just has to be top of the list.
"Hey, my page doesn't change"
"Clear your cache, clear your cookies, try another browser, try another 
machine"
"Done that!"
"Okay, email Google and ask them to clear THEIR cache. Give them a week 
or two."
.........no thanks.

I don't see though how this is causing the issue posted though. Either 
way, if there is a "Junk Host" list, then Bravenet need to be on that.

If your site is sufficiently popular, people using Google Web 
Accelerator will decrease your bandwidth use, not increase it. Maybe 
WordPress could block GWA or not depending on how many hits your site is 
getting. :-)

without wanting to get into a full blown discussion going over old old
ground on this subject, you need to understand that the wording of
IETF RFCs is very specific about 'must' and 'should', etc. Regardless
of how anyone else might interpret these words in any other context.
RFC 2119 has the full details: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2119.html

In particular the section of rfc2616 you quote says "GET and HEAD
methods SHOULD NOT ..." Rfc2119 states

4. SHOULD NOT   This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
   there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
   particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
   implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
   before implementing any behavior described with this label.

So, WordPress, along with millions of other web applications (think
web counters), has GET requests which change the state of the server.

Sure, but come on -- do you really think the reason WordPress doesn't 
follow this part of the RFC is because, when implementing those pages, 
Matt read RFC 2616 and said "oh, it only says SHOULD, we're all right 
then"? :-) Many authors (including me) just didn't read it.

>...

Web counters have always been broken anyway (think caches).

> has GET requests which change the state of the server.
>...

And have always been broken. Google Web Accelerator is merely the most 
famous of many pre-fetching accelerators, some of which have been around 
for years. Are you going to try and block them all?

And it's not just accelerators you have to worry about. Imagine that 
you're not using comment moderation (maybe you're using an anti-spam 
plug-in instead). Then one day someone makes a seemingly innocent 
comment on one of your posts, linking to an article they found on a 
similar subject. You click the link, and by the time you realize it goes 
to <http://zed1.com/journalized/wp-admin/post.php?action=delete&post=1>, 
it's too late.

Sorry Matthew, but even in jest trying to convince me that Google is 
acting in some sort of benevolent way is utterly pointless.

Fact is this - if Google's caching is going to cause WordPress users 
problems, and if that is going to cause them to post to the forums, then 
I'd be grateful now if someone could write the technical explanation 
that I will be cutting and pasting dozens of times.

If this is going to be a problem for WP USERS, then either something is 
NOT done and we paste answers to posts, OR something IS done.

No more than a normal person wraps his paragraphs in a <p> </p>. If
standards don't make practical sense, they will be replaced with
standards that do. As for the RFC and what Mike said about "Should",
it validates Matt's (or anyone else's) common-sense choice as being
sound. So would you now still say that WP violates these rules, with
Mike's clarification on the subject? If WP does not violate the rules,
then GWA is acting irresponsibly. Clearly, a browser, crawler, or any
sort of third-party web application should find it in itself to be
"robust" and tolerant of non-standard-compliance on the part of the
distributed clients.

I'm not sure, really... With GWA, Google is doing on a global scale what
ISPs are doing everywhere. It's just a poorly programmed proxy bundled with
spyware.

Fact is Google is betting that hosting the proxy in their facilities can
speed things up. From the user's perspective, it might. But from your site's
perspective, odds are strong that it will make no difference.

The real difference will be this: While an ISP is a telco that is usually
committed to keeping all user data secret, Google is committed to target ads
more efficiently.

Then again, I imagine some users will find the google content blocker
useful. :)

Matthew,
My very specific point was that WordPress is well within the
specification detailed in rfc2616 and therefore there is no reason to
call for WordPress  to remove its standards compliance message.

Your assertion that :
> Either WordPress should be brought into compliance, or the "Full
> standards compliance" bullet point should be removed. 
Was demonstrably wrong. 

I also don't think Google's Web Accelerator has anything to do with
this particular support problem.

Okay, here you go:

---8<---
A security vulnerability has been identified in WordPress that could 
allow an attacker to delete posts, pages, or comments on your Weblog, by 
getting you to click on a link. The attacker could (for example) include 
this link in a comment on your Weblog or someone else's, or send it to 
you in an HTML e-mail message.

This vulnerability may also cause posts, pages, or comments to be 
deleted, your Weblog theme to be changed, or unexpected logouts, if you 
use Google Web Accelerator or another Web accelerator tool while 
administering your WordPress site.

Until the vulnerability is patched, you can help protect yourself by 
following these steps.

1.  If you do not already have a user style sheet for your Web browser,
     follow <a href=
     "http://www.squarefree.com/userstyles/user-style-sheets.html">Jesse
     Ruderman's instructions</a> to create one. Put this text in it:
         a[href*="wp-admin/"] {
           color: purple !important;
           background-color: yellow !important;
         }
     This will cause WordPress administration links to appear as purple
     text on a yellow background.

2.  Do not click on links with purple text on a yellow background,
     unless they appear on WordPress administration pages. Even here, do
     not click them if they appear inside comments or trackbacks.

3.  If you use Google Web Accelerator, follow <a href=
     "http://webaccelerator.google.com/support.html#preferences2"
     >Google's instructions</a> to make it inactive whenever visiting
     your own Weblog, or any other Weblog that you often read comments
     in. Similarly if you use any other Web accelerator tool, configure
     it to be inactive whenever visiting your own Weblog or any other
     Weblog that you often read comments in.

4.  If you read e-mail in an e-mail program, do not click any links
     containing the text "wp-admin". If you also accept HTML e-mail, do
     not click any links in messages from people you do not know.

The vulnerability will be fixed in WordPress 1.5.2.
---8<---

Caveat: I haven't tested any of the above. (Ideally, there's something 
obvious I'm missing such that the problem doesn't affect WordPress at 
all.) So you might like to test the instructions before disseminating them.

I know it takes the wind out of your "advisory" but these are all 
primitive forms of XSS that WP already protects against. In addition a 
API hook was added prior to the release of 1.5.1 in order to make 
plugins that block the GWA extra easy:

http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2595

I wanted people to test HTTP_X_MOZ=PREFETCH blocking in plugins and work 
out any issues there before rolling it in.

Ah, so that's what I was missing. :-) Great. It looks like the code you 
linked to doesn't protect against links in comments and trackbacks when 
they appear inside the admin interface for moderation. And it doesn't 
protect people using GWA (though I see you have a patch for that), or 
people using another prefetching accelerator. And it doesn't let you 
have Referers turned off a la RFC 2616 section 15.1.3 (but you knew that 
already). And it makes extra work for anyone who renames the wp-admin/ 
directory to deter attackers. Using POST buttons where appropriate, 
instead of links, would fix all those problems, but I guess there's some 
good reason for not using them.

If we're still talking about the admin interface, a plug-in will protect 
those people who know they need to install it, which is better than 
protecting no-one. Again, using POST buttons would protect everyone, 
whether they were using GWA or any other accelerator, but oh well.

If we're talking about visitors in general, IMO the "Reading" options 
page would be a good place for a prefetcher-blocking checkbox.

The MOZ prefetch header seems to be a convention, which is why Google 
adopted it. Accelerators have been around a while, none have been as 
brain-dead as Google's "beta" as far as I know.

There are always tradeoffs in a secure system.

Renaming wp-admin wouldn't deter attackers, is not support in any way in 
the program (maybe we could add some options for it :-p), and is "snake 
oil" security, which we don't endorse or encourage.

Finally! Thanks for understanding that the real world may appear simple 
from the heights of the ivory tower but actually there's usually a good 
reason for everything in a mature system even if it's not immediately 
apparent.

Google, for all their strengths, was idiotic for releasing a product 
that breaks the way millions of web applications, including some of 
their own, work. Note that no one from Google came out citing RFCs as 
the reason their product is wreaking havok across the web, because they 
realize more than anyone else that GWA is broken, which is *why they 
took it down it after just a few days*. I find it funny that so many 
people are rushing to their defense -- they're a big company and can 
defend themselves.

Dude, that was the opening for you to say what the reason *was*. :-) If 
it was ever discussed, sorry I missed it. I seem to recall suggesting 
pre-1.2 that "Log Out" should be a button (though the "Delete" links 
escaped me completely), but I can't remember why you disagreed.

This is something that's been discussed in the What-WG recently
<http://listserver.dreamhost.com/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2005-May/thread.html#3897> 
-- why are people using links for non-idempotent actions when they 
should be using POST? The prevailing theory is that it's to make them 
look pretty compared with surrounding links; but that can't be the case 
for WordPress, because the "Delete" links are in table cells by 
themselves, and other buttons in the admin interface are heavily styled. 
So seriously, I'd love to know.

I'm not defending them -- serving people *other* people's cached 
versions of a page, in a way that existing proxy caches don't, is asking 
for trouble. But the prefetching is an interesting example of how, if an 
allowance in a specification isn't taken advantage of quickly, it tends 
to become unusable. If prefetching accelerators had been this 
well-publicized years ago, authors would have realized the problem 
sooner, and there wouldn't have been so much pain now.

It's not a showstopper, but if someone has an idea of where this could come
from, it would be nice to try to address it asap. The bugged bloggers are
currently reporting as much info as possible, but if they get the feeling
that noone cares, they'll eventually stop.

I've checked all the websites of the people who reported the problem.  
With the exception of one, who doesn't appear to have WordPress 
installed anymore, all of them have working comments.  "Reproducibility" 
was "always," so I guess it either fixed itself (as one poster seems to 
indicate) or they figured out the problem.

In short, in default themes, feed URI's have 'feed:' prefix. Ie.:

feed:http://www.mikis.org/blog/feed/

What is this for? At least Firefox doesn't recognize it as a valid protocol.

Safari RSS, most feed aggregators, the Yahoo toolbar, etc all either 
register the feed: protocal or plan to in the future. Chances are if you 
have an aggregator that link works far better than dumping you on a 
screen with a bunch of XML. If your aggregator doesn't support feed: I 
would file a bug with them.

Thanks. I don't (usually) use aggregators, but my friend noticed it 
doesn't work in Sage RSS reader, and I was curious because it doesn't 
work in latest Firefox either.

I think both Sage and Firefox are still pretty new in terms of 
aggregation and have a long way to go.

I'm impressed with sites that use XSL with their XML/RSS feeds to
display a 'what is this?' page to their users rather than showing them
the direct feed.  Often it parses some of the XML to show the most
recent content, and also has quick links that would open a feed: URL, or
allow people track them via Bloglines, etc.  I think the WP community
could benefit from that kind of self-documented pages, and would let
people who want to use the feed be able to click/copy the link without
their browsers breaking with an unknown feed: protocol error.  I'd
submit a patch, but I'm afraid I don't really know how they do that....

RSS Ownl and FeedDemon doens't recongise it too, and if other plans in
the future means that's not a widespread standard, so adopting it now
willm ake just people get confusing, asking why the feeds for XYZ blog
doesn't works etc etc.

Maybe this would be better to be implemented in few months when it's
more supported.

Well... implementing something that state:

"This draft HAS NOT been submitted for publication, and does not have
any status; it should be referred to as a "pre-draft."

in a program used by hundred thousands people most of them totally
ignorant about tech stuff is a bit premature isn't it?

FeedDemon should recognize the protocol, what version are you using?.  
Nick was one of the major proponents for this change.  It helps 
FeedDemon know that it's a feed rather than trying to second-guess every 
XML file as an RSS document or not.

I've never heard of RSS Ownl, FeedDemon supported feed: in 1.10:

There is a point where we must decide to embrace emerging standards in 
order to provide the best experience and encourage adoption. The same 
argument you're making could have been made against using XHTML and CSS 
a few years ago, but that bet has worked out pretty well for WordPress.

No one who clicks those links wants to see the XML or even a styled 
version of the XML, unless they're a developer debugging something. They 
want to subscribe to the feed, and we should do what we can to make that 
as easy as possible,

I disagree.  If I want to subscribe with bloglines, or anything that I 
copy/paste the feed to somewhere else, the feed: links don't work.  I'm 
also against people who _only_ put RSS links in the header <link> tag.  
(In that case, I can see there's a feed for the page, but if I click on 
the lower right link in Firefox it will do the active bookmark thing and 
not give me the feed link.)

I don't think http://feeds.feedburner.com/wwdn looks like "the front 
page again, but uglier."  In fact, I like that it has links to 
documentation and quicklinks for auto subscribing to the feed.  Or, I 
can just copy the link from the address bar whereever my 
reader/aggregator uses it and go from there.  I think Feedburner could 
use a bit more documentation, but I like that presentation better than a 
feed:http:// link.  (Note that the XSL has a "Subscribe now using 
feed://" link.)

I just tested FeedDemon and it works fine with feed: links

Now, the mistake may be in trying to paste the string such as 
feed:http://www.mikis.org/blog/feed/
into the new feed dialog.
that will not work.

Which, unless I am mistaking, is another way to say: The feed: is so poorly
implemented that it should not be there in the first place.

I personally had several users query me about error messages related to
feed: blah blah blah. To a point that I eventually removed it, and that I
never even considered adding feed: to my subscribe me plugin. Speaking of
the plugin, its next version will likely feature an option to enable
QuickSub:

http://www.methodize.org/quicksub/

You'll notice that QuickSub has no reference to feed: either.

And for what it's worth, nor does microsoft.com.

I think you are mistaking...

Feed: is just like Mailto:

Its ust a handler so programs know what to do with the email address or 
now the feed address.

Would you expect to paste a mailto:myemail@something.com into the To: 
field of a mail program and have it work?

That said, I think we can all agree that there has to be more education 
for people as to what's going on here.

Ya, I'm quite aware, but I've yet to try a program that supports it. I'm
aware some exist, but I do not use them. And as far as I'm concerned, as
long as IE and FF (= 99% of users?) do not support it, IE being the more
important of the two, I'll consider feed: is a user misleading non-issue. :)

> Would you expect to paste a mailto:myemail@something.com into 
> the To: field of a mail program and have it work?

I would select and copy the email in the text, i.e. without the mailto:, or
right click and 'copy email address' in FF. Whereas if you click a feed:
link in FF, I get an error, and if you right click and copy it, you'll need
to edit the result before you can use it.

I assume by your remarks that you are not into HCI. You'd be surprised by
the number of 2-button mouse users who are not aware you can right click
things. Don't laugh, right clicking is a very complex thing to do. :D

In any event, this leads me to suggest that many users click on the link and
copy the resulting url in their address bar, and that standard or not, feed:
should not be implemented in WordPress until IE handles it properly.

My $.02

mailto: isn't handled by default unless there's a mail application 
installed. Windows just happens to come with a mail application, and in 
Longhorn it'll come with a feed application just like Tiger does today. 
It has nothing to do with IE or Firefox, except you pointed out two 
excellent points that shoudl be filed in Firefox's bugzilla, I'm sure 
they can fix them by the next release.

If MS has any plans to support feed:, they will likely implement it when
they release a feed reader with IE7. But in any event, my only suggestion is
to rule feed: out of WP until then.

Matt, hang out with some real users once and a while. Not everyone on 
the net is a tech-savvy early adopter who constantly updates their 
software -- the update cycle in the real world is very slow.

I would be wary of making changes of this nature at such an early stage 
(viz "...plan to in the future"). Don't break things for (bleeding) 
edge cases.

My preferred solution is transform feeds with xslt and provide 
additional instruction on how to subscribe on the resulting page rather 
than breaking things for 99% of the net... you could have your feed 
protocol link on that page if you insist.

Later you make a point later in this thread about the adoption of XHTML 
+ CSS as a means to justify early adoption of the feed protocol. The 
reality is the uptake on these was pretty slow... defined in the late 
90's they only really gained any *real* traction around 5 years after 
the fact, and most of us are still working around IE's lousy standards 
support.

I have to agree that we should *not* be using feed: links.

A good recommendation from lots of Usability, UI, Accessibility, HCI,
etc. resources is "don't surprise the user". I think that clicking on
a link that says "Entries (RSS)" and which looks like an ordinary link
 should not surprise the user. When it goes on to produce an error
message in the majority of cases that is not going to "provide the
best experience".
 
I'm a very sophisticated user, running Linux and Windows. I use
Firefox and Mozilla and even IE if I have to, but I don't have a local
feed reader installed. I use bloglines. I have blog lines browser
extension installed which allows me to right click and "subscribe to
this link". It does not work.
I don't consider Bloglines to be broken. WordPress is broken.

It used to be the case that Windows didn't come with an email
application, and if I recall correctly, at least Netscape used to pop
up a message when you clicked on a mailto link to say "An email
application is not installed... please install one" or some such. In
other words the browser recognised the protocol and handled it
appropriately.

I understand and appreciate that new standards don't get adopted if no
one uses them, but this is not the way to help.

How about this? 

We go back to the normal RSS/RDF/ATOM links that people are just
beginning to understand. Have those links produce a page prettified
with XSL and with extra helpful information including a link to the
feed protocol.

In addition, we have a link to the feed protocol feed which explains
just what it. "Subscribe to this blog with your feedreader" or some
such.

I think that gives us the best of both worlds.

I've now dealt with literally hundreds of users-- students and
faculty-- who are completely baffled by the feed: protocol. At least
with CSS and XHTML, there was a submitted spec-- even a draft-- before
it was adopted. I routinely strip the prefix now when we do setups
because it is so unreliable. Paste http://url.to.feed/ into ANY
Aggregator and it works. Do the same with feed: and it might. If you
are lucky.

I agree that feed: is a good solution to a real problem, but it seems
strange to jump so far ahead of the curve with a piece of software
designed to be useful to less techie end users...

Hi everyone,

I just wanted to bring OpenID to the attention of the community.

http://www.danga.com/openid/

 From their page:
******************
This is a distributed identity system, but one that's actually 
distributed and doesn't entirely crumble if one company turns evil or 
goes out of business.

An OpenID-enabled site/blog lets you authenticate using your existing 
login from your homesite (whether that's on your own server or a hosted 
service) without giving away your password to the 3rd-party site you're 
visiting, or making a new account there, or giving away your email address.

And it's secure, and can run entirely in the browser without extensions, 
without moving between pages.

******************

Their intentions seem good and they want to have WordPress support so 
long term, this might be something we want to be a part of.

If this isn't the way to mention such ideas, I apologize in advance.

Please excuse my ignorance, but I have another (stupid) question. 
What is the advantage of using:

feed:http://example.com/something

instead of (more logical and intuitive, if you ask me):

feed://example.com/something

The above mentioned draft allows for both?

I do agree. This seems to make more sense and its allowed in the draft. 
It would seem to be consistent with http:// ftp:// https:// etc, etc.

If we do keep it, I vote for feed:// instead of feed:http://

I know its a bit more complicated than the current prepend feed: to 
[blog uri]/feed/ and some replacing of http with feed might need to take 
place, but in the long run with the semantics of Wordpress, I think it 
just looks better.

Just my $.02

I thought this was a good idea back in February when I saw something 
similar.  It doesn't seem too difficult, but I do object to adding yet 
another field to the four-field-and-a-button comment form.  I think if 
it got to the point where it was saving users time to log in this way, 
rather than making them jump through hoops for no great reason, it might 
have some advantage that could be leveraged to replace or augment the 
existing method.

Also, it's somewhat implausible to expect that the comment form is going 
to look a certain way on every blog - inserting a new field into that 
mix via plugin would be difficult or ugly.  Using an existing field 
would be ideal.

I thought I heard someone on IRC working on this today.  Who was that, 
and what were you planning?

That wouldn't work if your WordPress site (and therefore your feed) was 
being served over HTTPS.

I know a majority of the wordpress community (me included) are *nix 
geeks, but seriously, have you ever seen somebody's blog served over 
https:// ? (note: the link to your site http://mpt.net.nz/)

I'd be glad to check them out, but as of the moment, have seen none.

You can visit
    https://www.skippy.net/blog/
You'll be asked to trust my self-signed cert; and after that you'll 
still not enjoy a totally secured connection because of non-secure links 
in the document (my flickr photos, I think, are the culptit).  All the 
WordPress-generated links are absolute links to the _non_ secure site, 
since WordPress doesn't (yet) elegantly integrate SSL.

I've been involved in a little bit of discussion about making WordPress 
better support HTTPS:
   http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Over_SSL
   http://codex.wordpress.org/Talk:Administration_Over_SSL

And I suggest CACert.org for anyone who wants a cert but doesn't want to 
fiddle with the openssl command line.  =)

Using https where it is by no means valuable is a poor choice. https is 
good for
nothing but admiration unless it serves a purpose.

As a matter of fact, https often makes things worse. It shuts the door on
certain browsers and platforms, it breaks consistency, and it slows down or
annihilates crawling (I am sure many WordPressers rely on Google for 
visitors).

My understanding is that OpenID would replace three of those four
fields. You would, as a blog author visiting other blogs, login to
your own blog, paste the URI into a blog you're reading, paste the
blog URI you're visiting back into your own blog, and you're
authenticated. I am obviously simplifying a lot, but this is the
general idea.

Er, what does any of that have to do with Mihailo's question? WordPress 
still works under HTTP, and it still works for people who aren't called

One question that is a likely show-stopper is whether users really want to

You right, but actually on WP Italy forum i got more questions about
feed: not working than 1.5.1 RSS problems, till the mainstream sw used
by people (and FF is one of it) doens't embrace that emerging
standards we will have lot of people complaining feed doesn't works.

In the 1.5.1 (beta) localized theme  i've removed the feed: statement
to avoid problem, for 1.5.2 final i'm planning to add a note in a
leggimi.txt file explaining why we use feed: and how to easily remove
it if people find problem with it... this as a system to support the
emerging standard and avoiding tons of questions on the forum, having
FF supporting it would be a great step to expanding this standard, on
wordpress-it.it we have 50% of people using FF meaning that WP
bloggers like open source a lot not only for blogging and this it's
great :)

Can we throw an explanatory post out on the dev blog feed ("What is the

Owen,
An explanatory post on the dev blog is going to help the thousands of
people who click on a link and get an error message. They don't know
what the dev blog is. They would not see the message. They are already
blind to the dashboard because they don't know what it is.

There is so much hooplah because it is important. We have to balance
user friendly (no errors) with cutting edge (support new protocol)

Suggestion for wp 1.5.2

add_filter( 'switch_theme', 'wp_install_theme' );

Wp_install_theme should:

- check if install.php exists
- run install.php if current theme != new theme (to avoid running the thing
by remote)

wp_uninstall_theme, wp_install_plugin and wp_uninstall_plugin would be nice

Mike,
An explanatory post on the dev blog will help the thousands of WordPress 
admins decide if this is an issue they even care about since this is a 
feature that works as-designed.  Whether this is an "important" issue 
seems dubious.

At the least, let me rephrase this way:  If the link *isn't* changed 
(and I'm of the opinion it should not be) then let's put something about 
it in the dev blog, which we presume WordPress admins will read.  Let 
each WordPress admin decide how they want to handle it on their own blog.

Well, it somewhat does. Because https:// support is about only thing I see
as "advantage" of using feed:http(s) vs feed:// . And I agree with Roy, I
fail to see any reasony why Wordpress feeds should be served via https. Even
if you absolutely need to do so, you can modify it to feed:https for
yourself, and I guess those who need it will know how to do it.

While we are at proposed, not even submitted standards, let me propose
another one -- feeds:// , for secure feeds ;)

Now, seriously:

I think that only "proper" way to handle this issue would be to add a
checkbox to WP administrative interface, something like:

[ ] Use feed: prefix for feed URI's 

Or something like that. You may even turn it on by default, but please at
least put an explanation *in WP interface itself*, because not many people
follow dev blogs, Codex or mailing lists for that matter (I do, and somehow
I missed it).

Yes, you are right, it *would* help wp admins. My response was more to
say that that message would not be sufficient to "be done with this
issue"

I still think it *should* be changed or rather, as per my suggestion
earlier, the wording changed to more explicitly state these are not
ordinary links.

There are still going to be people that ask "Which button do I push to 
Publish a post?" no matter how well we document it or obvious it seems. 
  I was just hoping to get this particular discussion over with.

I'll state my case, since nobody is defending feed: as ardently as they 
are poo-pooing it, and then you can all say "Bah!" and continue to rant.  :)

Personally, I prefer the http:// link to feeds because it does not cause 
failure, and the output could potentially be styled to explain to the 
user what to do with it.  However, I realize that feed readers are 
becoming more important for my daily use of the web, and a link in a 
browser that tells my feed reader what to do is more useful to me than a 
link that I have to copy.

Moreover, without the feed: "protocol", the xml that appears is useless 
to a user.  I know the mailto: analogy has been made before, but I'll 
present a different way of looking at it.  Imagine that when you clicked 
a mailto: link, instead of opening your email program, your browser 
displayed routing information to the email address in question. 
Essentially, that's what happens when you click on a feed link, 
especially without XSL to style it.

On the topic of XSL, it's worth mentioning that using strictly http: and 
XSL doesn't allow installed feed readers to capture those links.  Feeds 
would seem like normal html files for display and nothing would trigger 
the feed reader to respond.  Even if you use a custom mime-type, that's 
no good because the browser doesn't pass the feed URL to the feed reader 
application; it passes the feed content.  Feeds are not required to 
contain the URL that generates them.

Now I'm going to explain why I don't think we should change it back.

I really do think that WordPress should take more initiative in pushing 
the technology.  We can't let other software drive the market, even if 
we're not a "business".  Using feed: seems pretty cutting edge, but as 
has been pointed out, it's already supported by many feed readers.  In 
this case we would not be pushing the technology, just catching up to 
where many feed readers already are.

In addition, if we change it back now, we'll just end up putting it back 
when everyone else starts to standardize on it and it becomes common in 
the public mind.  And at what point would we decide that it's a common 
thing?  Please not by having another discussion such as this every few 
months.  Let's just do it now and get the public behind the idea of 
easier to use feeds.

Finally, I don't think anyone has bothered to reference these or 
annotate them, so here they are:

URI of "feed:" RFC -
http://www.25hoursaday.com/draft-obasanjo-feed-URI-scheme-02.html

URI of "URI" RFC -
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt

Note that "feed:" is not a protocol like HTTP, it is a URI scheme that 
tells a program that the protocol is either HTTP (if specified as 
"feed:example.com/feed/"), or HTTP or HTTPS (if specified directly as 
"feed:http://example.com/feed/" or "feed:https://example.com/feed/"). 
The protocol can be specified in the URI to avoid having to register an 
additional scheme handler, as has been jokingly remarked upon elsewhere 
in this thread.

Yes, it looks funny, but there is an actual reason for it.  If you don't 
like the way the protocol specifier looks and you're not using SSL to 
provide your feeds, you can change it to the pretty 
"feed:example.com/feed/" and still comply with the spec.  Read the spec, 
it's short.

Check out this URI as a jumping-off point for other online discussion on 
the use of feed: and whether it's a good idea:
http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/feeddemon_and_t.html

I stand by the assertion that it's in WordPress' best interest to at 
least inform WP admins (via the Dashboard) what the ultimate feed: 
decision is, how we arrived there, and what they can do if they don't 
like it.  Besides that, it would be nice to have volume in the Dashboard 
besides WordPress release announcements.  People might realize that 
there are intelligent folks (everyone contributing to this thread) 
thinking about even the smallest details of WordPress and blogging (like 
this issue, IMHO) between releases.  When considering the issue of "How 
do we reduce support questions?" it occurs to me that the dev blog could 
be used less sparingly.  A "support issue of the week" thing might be 
cool.  Tangental.

Bah.  Should've written this as a post.  Maybe I'll write up a "What's 
this 'feed:' thing?" post instead.  Is there a Codex page already?

It's me, and I'm planning to make a PHP-based (and hence WP-pluggable) 
server for that primarily (so you can put your blog address in OpenID 
clients); perhaps a client too, but I can't imagine where anyone but the 
blog author(s) would want to 'login' to WP. Perhaps it may save a 
super-quick registration process if you only allow registered users to 
comment.

It's also interesting as a commentor-id-authentication system (as in, 
you are who you say you are), a weaker equivalent (because of it being a 
non trust-based system) of PGP-signing things.

(Pardon the parenthetical overdose, it's early and I'm in no mood to 
redo those sentences :)

- The State and Future of the Codex
- WordPress.org: integrating the Codex
- Release 1.5.2
- WRC and /Extend
- Identity Update

Open Action Items:
- Carthik is organizing a coordinated Codex maintenance binge of doom 
and needs around 5 volunteers.
- Photomatt will be looking into bringing the Codex more in line with 
the look and feel of WP.Org and possibly integrating logins.

As always, you can post agenda items for the next meetup in the codex.

I don't believe that feed: is actually a protocol, which is  
contributing to this problem.  I realize that mailto: isn't really a  
protocol either, but I don't believe that comparing mailto: and feed:  
is valid, one doesn't even use http as a transport in the end.

What feed: does is use the http protocol (I'm not saying anything new  
here, just trying to clarify things).  Feeds are document types,  
which should be dealt with by mime types.  Unfortunately that isn't a  
perfect solution either.

So what should we do?  Personally I ripped out the feed: links and  
simply used http: again to point at the feed urls.  In Safari this  
works exactly as you would expect, it determines that it is a feed  
and shows it as such.  In Firefox is displays it as pretty XML, as  
does IE.  In my opinion this is better that giving an error because  
you are asking the browser to use a protocol that doesn't exist (feed:).

At the very least if you are going to reference the feed: idea don't  
refer to it as a protocol.  As for getting more browsers and tools to  
make use of feed:, I don't believe that putting up broken links on WP  
installs is going encourage much of anything.  If feed: does become  
more wide spread it will be because of the massive use of feeds now,  
not putting up broken links on sites.

Recommendation: someone who really cares about this write us a hot XSL 
transform for WP feeds, find a way to hook into the XML header 
(actually, even a patch/manual-file-replace would do), so we abrased and 
affronted http://feeduri.xml partisans can jaw-clenchedly manually 
replace the feed:// URIs in our themes and  have the spiteful 
satisfaction of subverting the dominant paradigm.

(Even CSS will do actually, XSLT can come later)

We don't need an option for this, it's just in the template. feed: is 
only appropriate for places where you expect people to click a link,it 
wouldn't be right for <link> in the <head> for example.

Only thing is, above mentioned "RFC" does not allow feed:example.com/ , 
it proposes feed://example.com/ .

There have been multiple pushes for similar things in the past.. The plugin 
stuff is obviously not going to happen after the previous discussion on the 
subject.

I think feed: takes us backwards, rather than forward. Comparing feed: to
DOS file extensions would probably make sense. It is redundant.

Technically, and as point out in a previous message, feed: is not a
protocol. And usability-wise, it would make more sense if the browser
handled feeds automatically, without any need for feed:. When you open a
Word document in IE, IE asks if you want to save it or if you want to open
Word to read it. Likewise, IE and FF should go: "Hey, my user just opened an
RSS feed; I'll ask my user if he wants to subscribe to it or if he wants the
raw XML."

Thus, and on closer inspection, I find myself wondering if MS will implement
feed: at all, in IE7 and Longhorn. Surely, some MS usability person will
pinpoint the above two points. They are strong arguments against. And
possible show stoppers for widespread feed: adoption.

Message-ID: <428D01C3.80304@netherclift.net>


This is a proposed change to the function the_ID() in the file 
wp-includes/template-functions-post.php, which I needed for a couple of 
templates I created.
It simply allows the ID to be returned instead of printed. I adopted the 
coding style from wp_title(), which already has this option.

The change is simply this:

function the_ID($display = true) {
    global $id;
    if ($display) {
        echo $id;
    } elseif (!$display) {
        return $id;
    }
}


Best regards,
Achton.

It's only redundant if you're talking about using mime types to 
differentiate a feed from web content, and as I've pointed out, this 
doesn't work because the browser would forward the content of the page 
to the feed reader, not the URL of the feed.  This isn't useful.

Telling the browser to open a link with the feed: scheme means without 
doubt that the referenced URL is to be opened with a feed reader, and 
includes the required information to make it work.

Since a web site may wish to render any XML as a web page in a 
requesting browser, I don't see any way to automatically detect whether 
XML is a feed or a web page other than using the feed: scheme.  I would 
be really annoyed if my browser starts asking me whether to subscribe or 
view every web page that is written in XML, thinking that it might be a 
feed.

It's unlikely that MS will ever implement feed: in IE, since protocol 
handlers are built into the OS, and so when a request for a feed: URI is 
  handled, it is passed of to the registered application for that 
protocol.  (Windows calls these protocol handlers, even though they're 
not protocols but schemes.)  If your email client wasn't registered to 
the mailto: protocol, your browser would churn wondering what to do with 
links that point to it.

Since all feed readers that implement feed: in Windows are accomplishing 
it by registering their app for that protocol (and if they're not, they 
should because it's uber-easy), there really isn't a reason for MS to 
adopt the feed: protocol directly into IE - and this also doesn't imply 
that their lack of support for it implies a general lack of support.

Agreed. However, "feed" is also not properly a MIME type like your Word 
document example. All feeds do not have a unified format.

A feed is probably best described as "a URL that serves snapshots of a 
flowing channel of atomic particles (articles)". Mailto: says, "what follows 
is an email address." Feed: says, "what follows is a feed." Though it may be 
transported over http, a feed is not a web page.

That concludes the philosphic portion of this letter. My opinion is that any 
user who cares about feeds should be able to digest some documentation and 
alter their feed links according to taste.

Until the proposed feed: spec takes hold in more mainstream apps, we are 
really only arguing about taste. And we should all be wise enough to know 
better.

There's probably a good reason, but why the differing approaches (two 
functions as opposed to a modifier parameter)?

Well, it's 6 of one, half-dozen of the other. Meaning, whether it's done 
via a function, or done via a parameter, the end result is pretty much 
the same, and I doubt the code difference is much either.

Most functions that echo have a "get_" counter part, and those that 
don't probably will in the future.

As far as the codex, developer documentation has always been a little 
lacking. Feel free to go add some stuff if you like, it is a wiki after all.

Very basic, but you get the idea. I tried to make a plugin out of it, 
but there's no hook in the right place in the wp-rss2.php file for that 
to work. (and yea, I only got it working with RSS2)

I had to add:

<?php echo '<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" 
href="http://jrm.cc/rss.xsl"?>'; ?>

Right under line 14 in wp-rss2.php



Mmm?

I was unlucky about thi on polyglots ML, that looked the right place,
so now i try here:

Time ago I read on Forum that if a theme is "gettexted" and a .mo file
named the same of the language specified in the config.php file is
present the theme will show up using the .mo file translations.

It talks about the load_theme_textdomain() funztion to be inserted at
the top of the theme (I suppose index.php) to load the ranslation file
if present.

Now I have a user that made a theme and localized it generated the
it_IT.mo file put it in the theme directory but the them show up still
in english. I Inserted the load_theme_textdomain() funtion as first
line of the index.php with same result.

The similar function load_plugin_textdomain() works as a charm.

What's wrong with it ? Thanks

_e('Translate this!', 'atheme');

The domain identifier must be in every call to _e() and __().

Subject: [wp-hackers] 1.5.2 or on to 1.6?
Message-ID: <428F9627.6090903@mullenweg.com>

I wanted some community feedback on where we should go next with 
development. There are basically two directions we could go right now, 
one is to a 1.5.2 release which focuses on incremental changes and 
improvements to the very-solid 1.5 base, or we could start working on 
adding some major functionality changes for a 1.6 release. (I realize 
this could happen at the same time, I don't think we should branch 
development.)

There has been some excellent usability feedback has come in from 
Gabriel White's paper, some upcoming feedback from my friend Jane Wells, 
and WordPress will be a project at the next FLOSS usability sprint at 
the end of July. I think there is lots of room for improvement in the 
administration interface and improving that experience could definitely 
be a focus of development for a good while. Improvements in usability 
and inline help would also ease the burden on the support forums.

There are some pretty ambitious things on the table for 1.6:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_1.6

(Note, if we call it 1.6 doesn't that break the fibbonaci sequence?)

As much more core code will be touched it's likely that compatibility 
with some things will be broken and there will need to be a long testing 
period.

Anyway I'm curious to hear thoughts about either direction.

I guess we should think about how stable 1.5.1 is before answering
this. If it feels like there are too many critical bugs (read:
crashes, major problems) so that further development would be haunted,
there's no point starting work on 1.6.

If you're looking for personal opinions, I think we should start work
on 1.6. Prioritise the front end overhaul (so work on the usability
enhancements pointed out by Gabriel White and others). Once we've done
that, we can start working on the back end ideas in the codex [1].

I would have thought the best direction would be to start work on 1.6 with an eye on adding some new features and
leave the idea of 1.5.2 open for a incremental improvement/bug-fix release based on a corpus of worthy bug fixes minor
improvements having built up in mosquito^H^H^H^H^H trac - maybe create a target release to which they can be assigned
and then go on a small patch fest to create a 1.5.2 if enough stuff turns up.

This list looks long an unwieldy!  Maybe the need expanding a bit with more description and maybe some sort of rating
scheme could be applied to them - maybe the work better as a list of features that you/we would like to see in a
future version of wordpress.

Could you specify which crashes and major problems you're referring to 
with links to the relevant tickets?

If we decide to focus on 1.6 then 1.5.x would not be updated except for 
critical security fixes. We've tried dual development in the past, it 
didn't work at all.

I would vote for 1.6. Mostly because I want to see a major overhaul of 
the user system. I few things are on that codex list (wp_user_meta, for 
instance) that are quite hot. But also, I want *way* better function 
calls for permissions, and better control over what user "level's" mean.

So, not to get into any more detail on that, as it is off topic, but I 
would say 1.6.

I'd personally vote for v.2.0 :)

I think there's room to make WordPress XML-based, and I regularly bump into
the limits of the plugin system. Namely, I would like to do something like:

$xml = post2xml();
echo post2html($xml,$xslt);

Both with built-in caching, of course.

I vote 1.6 as well, leaving 1.5.2 as a possible bug fix release. I
would especially love to see exhibit 2 in WordPress 1.6. I remember
Owen said he'll release it once 1.5.1 is out, but there was no word
from him regarding this for some time so I'm guessing he's going to
leave it for 1.6. Oh well...

I think 1.5.2 would be a good idea.  I think addressing the usability
issues would be a good thing. To gain that market share WordPress
needs to be really simple for the novice. It needs to gain a
reputation for stability and security.

I also am quite concerned with the quality of testing we have. I think
some of the last minute bugs found were quite unnecessary. That is to
say, they should have been caught earlier.

I'd like people to consider an automated formal testing setup for
Wordpress. I'm specifically thinking of the xUnit unit testing
frameworks. Has anyone had any experience of phpUnit [1]?. I'm using
jUnit for Java everyday at work and it makes a huge difference to
quality and speed of development.
It would be great to have a suite of automated tests that could be run
which would verify all the core functionality before every release.

The usability changes, which I would vote for as first priority, seem  
a 1.6 thing to me (perhaps this is what you intended with your first  
email).  Naturally, the items listed on the [[Version 1.6]] page on  
Codex, which look pretty hot, but I'd say come second to usability,  
are also 1.6 material.  So we've got a fairly clear idea what would  
be involved in 1.6 and its development, but when you say

I, at least, am unclear on exactly what that would entail.  What  
sorts of things would be taken up in further 1.5 development?

I personally think that development should head on to 1.6, with usability 
coming first and the things listed on the Codex afterwards (updated 
usability is not enough on its own to constitute a new release imho). Not to 
say that development and bugfixing to the 1.5 branch should be discontinued, 
but focus should shift to adding new features, and bugfix releases should 
come as needed.

And a question about the Version 1.6 page on the codex. Is that supposed to 
be RFC 3229 instead of RPC 3229. Not much came up for RPC 3229. There's also 
some talk about the same thing, so maybe someone knows?

Mike's idea seems excellent. As a generic non-coder, I don't grasp
much of the discussion, but I do understand the need towards subtle,
yet distinctive usability features (especially some colors preferred
in the menu) would really do wonders for the less-techy inclined or
non-techy users that just want to use the software. You'll be
surprised to know how many generic users actually choose a software by
just looking at the screenshots. Stupid as it may seem, but a lot of
them do, and that includes me.

Dashboard could avoid news tiling (that takes much space) and instead
look like miniposts.

It would be nice if it is possible to add the "increase writing space
area" for textarea for writing posts, similar to those that we've seen
for comment boxes.

I still think a generic database backup system should be part of the
core, and not as a plugin. I think priority one here. I may be
paranoid about backups (who isn't), but it defeats the purpose of
writing a blog if we don't have an easier way to have a safecopy.

For the Admin menu, is it possible to include links to Codex for all
the options present, so that for those that do not know what a
particular field does, can look-up the awesome Codex.

I was also wondering if Pingbacks and trackbacks moderation could be
made part of the core, instead of the plugins that are available. The
idea is that the owner should be able to control everything,
no-involuntary receipts to the blog of any kind. I think in light of
spam, you'll agree with me.

The version number probably is best left to the lead-developers to
decide based on the extent of work done in the new revision.

Finally, a huge thank you to you all for making my software beautiful
on the inside. I love it.

Chetan's point reminds me of the potential in pure-CSS cascading menus at the
top of the dashboard. Not only is it quicker to use, but also it is more
natural to amateur users who perceive menus this way. Regarding compatibility,
with all the forms and advanced CSS, one can assume that the dashboard is used
within a rich browsing environment.

Everybody does, but some are reluctant to admit it. That's what the Internet
allows you to do.

Remember the days when you went to the shop to buy some nice quest? What would
you do first? Flip the package over and watch the 'screenshots'.

It probably should be customisable. Never decide for a reader what he/she
supposedly wants to read.

> It would be nice if it is possible to add the "increase writing space

In both cases, it is probably better to have a large textarea and avoid the
extra widget.

Everyone's got good ideas for both, why not do both? If Matt can find
someone he's willing to put in charge of maintaining the 1.5.x branch,
just for bug fixes and what not, while the core dev team moves on to
1.6, why not handle it that way?

Even if we move to 1.6, there will be need for immediate (And
semi-immediate) fixes to the 1.5 branch, which means someone will need
to babysit it. Personally, I'd like to see most of the guys working on
1.6, incorporating the community feedback about 1.5 to resolve major
issues and add in the things that were wanted for 1.5, but not really
ready yet.

As an aside, if we version bump it to .8, the fibinacci sequence is covered too!

Sorry if any and/or all of this is a rehash of what's been said, I
haven't really had time to read the 60 or 70 some-odd emails that you
guys have tossed at me since thursday!

Yeah, that's the plan.  Poorly coordinated with a server move, second 
child rearing, and paid work ramp-up, but that's the plan.

My other input on the 1.6 v 1.5.2 issue:

Someone says something about redesigning the dashboard.  I don't know if 
any of you stopped by my site on FFAF, but the CSS redesign work that 
Joe Kohlmann did for the admin interface is pretty darn sweet - *I* love 
it.  I can't remember if it's the same as what I have on my site, but 
this plugin download (http://asymptomatic.net/downloads/wp/adred.zip) is 
a good taste of what it offers.  I wrote the plugin, not the CSS or 
images.  If the admin menu can be made into dynamic CSS, it would solve 
the most major irritation I have with WP at the moment.  Followed 
immediately by the unsolved link manager crappiness, which would be 
solved in 1.6.

Unit testing for a major version update should be a priority.  It's not 
something I like suggesting, but getting some code coverage info would 
do wonders for working bugs out like what caused issues for 1.5.1.  I 
don't know what tool could be used for this in PHP, but something's got 
to be out there.  If everyone on the testers list used it, we could 
hopefully not only ensure that every byte of code is tested, but 
determine what went wrong while testing occurred.  Who knows, we could 
even save some time by doing proper regression testing.  A good tool 
would be a boon here.

Another wishlist item for a major revision: RSS plugin hooks.  Can we 
consider rolling in an existing class to handle this?  Something like 
this would be nice: $class->items = $posts; $class->output('RSS2');

Also, Magpie in WP is broken.  Getting it to do things other than what 
WP already does isn't difficult, but it could be made easier and more 
error-free if Magpie wasn't somewhat mangled.  And do we even use Snoopy 
anywhere? (Can't remember if I found one reference or not.)

Finally, WordPress looks good now, and the 1.6 features already listed 
on the Codex are killer.  But I think we still need a showstopper.  With 
a new release I don't want WordPress to be the software that best does 
what all the other blogging software can do - I want WordPress to do 
that one thing extra that everyone else has to catch up on, and all the 
non-WP bloggers envy.

Ignore my fantasy features if you might-- I still want all the features 
on the Codex v1.6 wishlist.  1.6 all the way.

I would like to se WP moving from 1.5.1 to 2.0, making clear that dev
team will take as long as necessary to develop it without givin' any
realease date or one really in the future to avoid what happened with
1.5.

I think this time 2.0 alpha showuldn't be made available trough
nyghtly, making forum people fighting with the nightmare of users that
complain aboutt last nightly bugs, better to set up a significant base
of alpha and beta tester making WP 2.0 public only from advanced beta
to RC.

I would care about theme and plugin developper to make them know about
changes long time before the realese of 2.0 to allow them having
enough time to adapt they plugins/theme if necessary.

Just my 2 cent

|||||So excited that it's finally gotten to this point!  I say that 
1.5.x only be extended for major bugs or security issues.  I really 
doubt there are any major bugs, so unless any security issues pop up, I 
say we move onward and upward.

Here are some of my ideas.  I'm just letting it all spill out, so don't 
take any of this as properly formatted idea... I'm just saying 
everything I've been thinking for the past year of working with 
WordPress.  So if you think something is stupid, just say so and move 
on... I don't want my half-baked ideas to start some big thing. ;-)


- Backwards compatibility
I think we should look at changes that will possibly break WP 1.2 
plugins, if the changes are warranted.  1.2 was the first showing for 
WordPress plugins, and a whole lot of that has changed since then, 
breaking many plugins in the process.  Basically, what I'm saying is 
that we shouldn't let backwards compatability with WordPress 1.2 hold us 
back from pushing the project forward.  It might be good to dedicate a 
Codex page to "changes that might break older stuff" so that plugin 
authors have fair warning of what they'll need to do for the next version.


- mod_rewrite defaults
A lot of people have problems making mod_rewrite rules because they 
choose a permalink structure that doesn't make sense, or that is poorly 
supported between different mod_rewrite implementations.  Category-based 
permalinks are especially troubling.  So for this reason, I think we 
should offer, instead of just a blank box, a list of maybe 3 or 4 "known 
good presets."

Recommended:
/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/
/%post_id%
/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%/
[invent your own]


Then the "invent your own" box should include a warning that not all 
structures will work, and it is safest to stick with the known good 
presets.  This would save a lot of time in the support forums.  People 
try all sorts of crazy permalink schemes and when they don't work, they 
do so in strange and unexpected ways, so they are hard to troubleshoot.  
I think if we offer the safe presets as radio selects, a lot of that 
will be avoided.


- plugin hooks
More hooks, please!  We should have a plugin hook brainstorming 
session.  I never want to have to hack WordPress core again, and I want 
to minimize the number of functions that I have to copy, rename, and 
modify.  Every time someone says "Hm, if I had a hook here, I could do 
X," we should consider adding a hook.


- Pages
Pages need some love.  We need page drafts, page/post versioning, 
ability for multiple people to work on pages, ability for "submit draft 
only" authors to submit a modified entry for approval without changing 
the original.


- "submit draft only" authors
I can think of lots of cool uses for this functionality, such as blogs 
that allow guest posters without having to explicitly choose authors 
ahead of time.  We need things to be as streamlined and easy as possible 
for this use.  We need better management and presentation of "please 
approve" drafts.


- echo/return/return-style
We've made a lot of progress with making sure that functions can echo as 
well as return.  We need to keep this going, as well as making sure that 
we offer ways to return the requested data as an array of objects.  
Things like this will save plugin developers a lot of time and frustration.
|

|
- get_currentuserinfo()
This is uuuugly.  It's a function that you just call, and it populates a 
bunch of global variables.  I want to do stuff like  <?php if 
(wp_user_level() > 5 && wp_user_login() != 'admin') : ?> and stuff like 
that.  This business of "did I call get_currentuserinfo()?  Are the 
variables I need declared global? is quite annoying.  Maybe there's a 
better way to do this, but I sure haven't seen anyone using it...
|

|- File Upload
The file upload feature needs a lot of work, especially when it comes to 
handling images.  Some might argue that this should be left to a plugin, 
but I'd disagree.  People expect their blog software to hold their hand 
with regards to posting images, and the current code does a really 
half-assed job of it.  We need to generate more code automatically, and 
actually check whether or not a thumbnail could be generated.  We need 
an option of a) thumbnail display, full image link b) thumbnail display, 
pop-up full image link, c) full image display.  We need better resizing 
options (specifically, max WIDTH, instead of max biggest side.  This 
really matters for fixed width layouts.)  We need to be able to upload 
images from the Write screen without losing our place.  We need the code 
we want automatically inserted into the post.  We need to be able to 
manage our uploaded images/files from within WordPress.
|

|- Theme Installation
I think we should at least consider creating a way for themes to be 
download/installed from within WordPress (or interfacing between the 
themes site and WordPress).  It would be really cool if you could choose 
from maybe 10 themes immediate after install! (not my idea... props to 
whoever suggested this).
|

|
- Critial update notification
There should be a feed monitored by WP for security updates.  Say we 
find a security issue in 1.5.1.1 and have to issue an emergency 
1.5.1.2... there should be a big red "UPGRADE NOW OR DIE!" box visible 
on every page of the admin interface.  There are still people out there 
on WordPress 1.2 or 1.5 and a lot of the time it is because they didn't 
see a need to update.  We need to have a way of clearly communicating to 
people the need to upgrade.
|

|
- MagpieRSS
We should keep Magpie up to date, and make it really easy for plugin 
devs to use it to do awesome feed-related stuff.

|

|- Content pre-formatting
I know the issue of caching the formatted post has been relegated to 
plugins (this one looks great http://www.vapourtrails.ca/wp-preformatted 
) but I think we should consider making this part of WordPress.  IIRC, 
TextPattern does this.  This could really open up a lot of possibilities 
with markup.  I've disabled the acronym plugin, because all the regex 
stuff was taking too long.  Searching every post for 200+ regexes isn't 
really something that should be done on the fly.  Obviously some filters 
have to be run live, like Google Hilight, so there should be an 
additional plugin hook created for this use (like 
"the_content_dynamic").  This would really help that "Every WordPress 
version is faster than the previous version" goal. :-)

|

|- Optimization
Ryan Boren did some excellent work on improving WordPress' caching, and 
we should be on the lookout for code that could be improved thusly.  
There shouldn't be any redundant queries or two queries when one could 
do the job.
|

|
- Dashboard
I think this goes without saying, but the Dashboard needs some love.  As 
much as I enjoy Matt's "asides," they don't belong there.  There should 
be tons of hooks for plugin authors.  I want total control over the 
dashboard.

Is the problem with mod_rewrite rules because of mod_rewrite, or WP?
My understanding of this problem is that it's WP getting these
"wrong," not mod_rewrite.

I don't like the idea of doing "presets" for permalink structures; I
much prefer fixing WP so that it can handle more permalink structures;
preferably any structure that has a good chance to uniquely identify a
post. (Barring a blogger making two posts with the same slug on the
same day, which has happened.)

Definitely more hooks.

Pages are pretty much the same as posts as far as the database is
concerned; why not just treat them equally?

Globals are bad, mmmkay? Just give me ONE at most, and make sure it's
populated by the time PHP starts parsing my plugin or theme.

I think someone's working on a WP Theme Mangler.

This is definitely a good idea. Of course, it would help if we can

This is definitely the most important feature that needs to go into 1.6!

Hi everyone.

I recently updated my gravatars plugin to provide translation support 
for the admin interface.  I followed these directions:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Localizing_Plugins

Two people have reported the same problem:
http://www.skippy.net/blog/2005/03/24/gravatars/#comment-2003

Fatal error: Class ?CachedFileReader? not found in 
/var/www/localhost/htdocs/wordpress/wp-includes/wp-l10n.php on line 72

Both users are running WP 1.5.1.1.  The plugin works for me on two 
1.5.1.1 blogs, but I'm not using any translation.

I don't know enough yet about i18n and l10n to dig into this.  Can 
anyone offer me some guidance?  Feel free to respond off-list.

Thanks!

Agreed. Even if we make it so that WordPress can understand every
unique permalink configuration under the sun, it still holds that some
structures are better than others. I think we should give three or
four suggested ones, and allow users to make their own up, as you've
said.

We do this already. Level 1 users can only submit drafts.

Yeah - it'd be really nice if we could have an official themes
repository that we could RPC from inside WP, or if that sounds like
too much work, bundle at least five themes with WP.

Yes. WordPress running 10+ queries per request is still too many in my eyes.

Unit testing, and especially PHPUnit, only tends to work with
object-orientated software. However, that doesn't mean that we should
abandon this idea -- I think the idea of a more object-orientated WP
is a great one, and a formal testing suite to go with it would be
brilliant.

The other thing I suggest for the next version of WP is a formal
release schedule, so we know when bug-fixing becomes a priority, when
we're going into feature-freeze, and when the big day will be. This
could avoid squabbling like that over restore [1].

Subject: [wp-hackers] .htaccess cleanup
Message-ID: <000001c55ef9$48bf4750$6702a8c0@DB>

While checking my .htaccess file, I found plenty of things like:

RewriteRule ^(projects/sem-theme)/trackback/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&tb=1
[QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(projects/sem-theme)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(projects/sem-theme)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(projects/sem-theme)/page/?([0-9]{1,})/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&paged=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(projects/sem-theme)(/[0-9]+)?/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&page=$2 [QSA,L]

One to a page. Given that I intend to use WP as a CMS, I expect the file to
quickly become huge. Thus, I was wondering, why something like the following
is not used:

RewriteRule ^(.+)/trackback/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&tb=1 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2
[QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)/page/?([0-9]{1,})/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&paged=$2
[QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)(/[0-9]+)?/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&page=$2 [QSA,L]

Wouldn't that rule catch just about damn near everything?

One of the clean ups I *do* find very useful is the combination of 
"page" htaccess definitions. Much the same lines of what you are 
thinking, but more specific.

Example, instead of 5 lines for each page, have:

RewriteRule ^(page1|page2|page3)/trackback/?$ 
/index.php?pagename=$1&tb=1 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(page1|page2|page3)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$ 
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(page1|page2|page3)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$ 
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(page1|page2|page3)/page/?([0-9]{1,})/?$ 
/index.php?pagename=$1&paged=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(page1|page2|page3)/?([0-9]+)?/?$ 
/index.php?pagename=$1&page=$2 [QSA,L]

Add "|pagename" as nessecary. This way you aren't catching things like 
"/robots.txt" with that last rule.

Or you could combine the two...

RewriteRule ^(.+)/trackback/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&tb=1 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)/feed/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)/(feed|rdf|rss|rss2|atom)/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&feed=$2 [QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+)/page/?([0-9]{1,})/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&paged=$2[QSA,L]
RewriteRule ^(page1|page2|page3)/?([0-9]+)?/?$
/index.php?pagename=$1&page=$2 [QSA,L]

Granted it's not *as* specific... but probably faster?

These would eclipse all other rules and break links.

RewriteRule ^(.+)(/[0-9]+)?/?$ /index.php?pagename=$1&page=$2 [QSA,L]

This rule would result in infinite redirects since it will match
anything; an internal server error would be issued once MaxRedirects was
reached.

Faster, no idea...gosh, I wouldn't even know how to test that for speed.

Well, I'm just assuming that saying (in code of course) "match any
character" is faster than saying "match this phrase, or that phrase, or
that phrase, or that phrase". But yeah, I wouldn't know either.

That's not necessarily true.  While some structures could be improved by 
tweaking WP, some others are due to quirks in mod_rewrite.  Check out 
Ryan's two different plugins to get /category/ permalinks working on 
quirky mod_rewrite implementations.  Of course, there's nothing 
preventing us from recommending default presets and improving the 
WordPress code as well...

Pages are designating using `post_status` which can be 'publish', 
'draft', 'private', 'static' or 'object' according to my database.  We 
don't have any way to do private drafts yet.  Maybe we should have 
'static-draft'.

Yes, we do it,  but it needs improving.

Not sure if anyone has taken a look at this, but BigJibby (aka Matt) in 
#wordpress saw this code written by boren and it is pretty simple, gets the 
job done I think:


   1. # WordPress Stuff
   2. RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   3. RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   4. RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /index.php/$1
   
I've been using that code for quite a while now and nothing has ever been 
broken and it has worked perfectly. Just my 2 cents for you guys to think 
about.

If you say so, I imagine... Though... If you put the rule at the end of the
.htaccess file, as a catch all, wouldn't the infinite redirect only occur of
the .htaccess file is evaluated several times?

I have those rules commented out in my .htaccess, but I haven't put in a
comment on why I'm not using them.

I did some experimenting now, and the rules work fine except that I never
get a 404 error for URL's that don't exist.  I just get the "root blog"
page (i.e. most recent posts).

Regards,

Typically regexp parsers stop as soon as they can determine a failure
(no match).  So a limited number of characters (as both in options for
each position of the string and in total length) should be faster than
something that can match the whole string.

Not so much.  Matching something specific with a regex is *always* 
faster than maching anything because when the regex engine hits the end 
of the string that it matches, it backs out of the match to find what's 
next.

Consider: .*a
Match that against this:
bbbbbbbbacccccc

This would first match the '.*' part against the entire string, and then 
backtrack one chracter at a time to find the 'a' that would come next.  
7 assertions on 'c's would fail before it found the match.  As you can 
imagine, '.*?a' is worse on 'bbbabbba'.  All of this is subject to 
optimization that might improve the performance of the regex, but 
speaking generally you shouldn't match against anything when you know in 
advance what set of things you want to match against.

Whether this general case can be applied to the regexes mentioned, I 
don't know, and whether an inefficient '.*' regex would be faster than 
multiple not-'.*' regexes I also can't say.  It's a tradeoff that you 
would need to measure, and I  really don't think my WordPress serving 
bottleneck is in the regex configuration.  If I was looking to optimize, 
I might start elsewhere first.

It is, to me, just a reading optimization. I had to edit the htaccess by 
hand to get a few custom redirects to work for my site, and starting 
down at 5 ruls for every single page was a bit much.

Firstly, I think the bug system needs to be stabilized and organized before 
any talk of development progress is made. A custom field needs to be added 
to the new ticket system in Trac for a "Patch?" boolean. At that point, all 
bugs that are assigned and have patches should be immediately committed and 
tested for a 1.5.2 release.

After that, a huge effort needs to be put into assigning, prioritizing, and 
triaging the bug list[1]. I don't know exactly how many people have 
privileges on the bug system, but it seems to be a very small number. I 
think the team needs to allow more people to help with triaging and 
organizing in Trac. "Bug days" like those over on
irc.mozilla.org<http://irc.mozilla.org>could help this process along
greatly.

Also, I think it would be good to set up a "review" and "super-review" 
system whereby contributing developers can get their bugs approved by core 
devs and can commit their own changes to the tree. Having only two 
developers commit changes makes development slow and disorganized and I 
think WordPress needs to look ahead to the future where there is a much 
larger developer community behind it. Of course in the meantime it would 
still be simpler with only Matt and Ryan committing if they could pull up a 
list of all bugs with a patch and r+sr, allowing them to commit and move on 
to the test cycle.

After the bug system is worked out, all of these new features in the Version 
1.6 wiki entry can be added to Trac and prioritized.

With a stable 1.5.2 release behind us, we can then start to make the larger 
changes slated for 1.6. I do think that we should definitely go toward
1.6and maintain backwards-compatibility, however. Software that breaks
b-c too
often and increments major version numbers regularly ends up in a bad 
position (v13.0 sucks).

In summary, I think we need organization and a clear set of goals and 
development processes before moving ahead to the next release. (Just my four 
cents.)

WP itself should handle issuing a 404.  There was a bug with this in 1.5
where the 404 wasn't always issued properly, but that should be fixed in
1.5.1[.1].  WP will also display the 404 template, if present.  If not,
you will see the regular index.   Well-behaved themes should have a
separate 404 template or handle the is_404() condition in their index.
The default theme has a 404 template.  The Classic theme does not.

Thanks for the explanation. In which case, I think the
(page1|page2|page3) one should be implemented, unless anyone has a
reason why it'd be a bad idea? I filed a bug:

Ryan -- thanks for the pointer -- that's it!  I'm not checking for
is_404() in the embedding index.

Yet another reason to do the embedding "the other way around," i.e.
by calling the non-wp parts from within a custom theme.

Thanks again!

If you ask me, all of this is a bit of premature optimization. If
anyone care to look up mod_rewrite benchmark, you'll see that it
easily handles thousands of rules without a hiccup. Unless the
intention is to make things easier on someone that wants to have their
own rules in their .htaccess, I think all should stay as is. Why
change something that has been proven to work well?

That one worked fine indeed, thanks a lot.

I did bump into a bug, though, but I suspect this comes from the wp source
code rather than the htaccess: WP then allows two pages to have the same
slug. Or might this be a feature?

There's a fairly complex class to change the mod_rewrite rules. It looks
very interesting. And I'm sure it's quite powerful. Problem is... it's
rather hard to find the documentation I would need.

Basically, I'd like to do:

http://www.semiologic.com/feed/ returns latest posts rss
http://www.semiologic.com/feed/updates/ returns latest updates rss

>From the looks of the class, I imagine a hook can let me do this somehow.
Any lead to which one would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I bumped into a couple of search related permalink structures in the
.htaccess and in the rewrite class. Sadly though, get_search_permastruct()
is apparently only called within the rewrite class. Is there any
undocumented yet 'official' way to get:

http://www.semiologic.com/search/blahblah/

Without the need to check the permastruct each time?

FWIW, my web server cannot write to .htaccess and having to cut&paste
the rules every time I add a page is an extra step I can do without.
*I* am not looking to optimize performance with this.

P.S.  I know more than one way to enable the web server to write to
the .htaccess file, but I prefer keeping the file under "manual"
control for now.  I run other sites with WP writing the file and it
works perfectly.

That would be a bug in WP I believe. I think that it's there so that you can 
have the same slug name if you're using a parent page or something of the

create duplicate slug names. It should probably run a check to make sure it 
doesn't already exist (whether under a parent or not) and then create it.

Apologies if this message comes off as harsh.  I'm satisfied with 
WordPress and I understand how difficult managing a large OSS project 
can be, especially with a large surge of users/interest/development.  
That being said....

I started on WP with 1.2.1 when the 1.3 betas were out, and didn't 
upgrade/try them because I was still getting my feet wet.  Then, 1.5 
released and I figured I would lurk the hackers list and found out how 
the new release was.  I read about a few minor to major bugs and knew 
there would be a 1.5.1 release and decided to wait until that.  Then, 
after 1.5.1 there were quite a few bug reports noted immediately after 
the release, and I read a 1.5.2 release would quickly follow to address 
some of these.  I'm still waiting for that release (although checking 
the download site now I see a 1.5.1.1 release that I didn't see 
announced here -- come to think of it, I'm not sure I saw the 1.5.1 
release announced here either.)

I'm still at 1.2.2 waiting for a "very-solid 1.5 base."  New development 
and major functionality growth are important, but IIRC a few of the 
1.5.1 bugs were not 1.5 bug fixes but new features that were not tested 
well enough before a release (and are still awaiting a public release to 
fix them.)  So my two cents goes for splitting the trunk -- getting the 
claimed "very solid 1.5 base" (via 1.5.2 or 1.5.3 or...) and leave the 
new development for 1.6+ versions.  I'm not recommending dual 
development, but we should be quick on the 1.5 point releases to fix 
bugs, especially while 1.6 is in the roadmap stage.

I think you should solidify/freeze the 1.5 feature set, and aggressively 
resolve all of the bugs in that feature set, with multiple point 
releases if necessary.  Once that's done, 1.5 should be "very-solid" and 
you're free to put the new features in 1.6.  But don't hold back the 
existing fixes in a 1.5.2 release because you want to redo/refactor 
something else. 

I don't lurk the testers list (because I'm not testing the nightly 
builds,) so some of this might already be happening -- but I think the 
best development improvement in WP would be improving the WP release and 
testing practices.  This is especially true when looking at majorly 
restructuring how things work in 1.6.  Would a better 
pre-release/release-candidate for 1.5.1 have fixed some of the first-day 
bugs?

Well, as far as the 1.5.1 release not being tested heavily, nobody can point 
the finger at anybody for this. A few days before the release it was posted 
on the testers list that a release was nearing and to try to push everyone's 
installs to the limit to find bugs. The list was literally silent for about 
3 days, so with nothing breaking, 1.5.1 was released. Then bugs started 
popping up left and right.

The whole point in 1.5.1 development was to freeze the feature set and do a 
bugfix release, and in fact that is all that has happened. With
1.5.1.1<http://1.5.1.1>,
I think we're already at that very solid 1.5 core, and ready for the next 
release development. If major bugs are found in 1.5.1.1 <http://1.5.1.1>, 
then sure, release 1.5.2 and such, but don't hold back on developing
1.6waiting for bugs in
1.5 to be found and fixed.

I've only been using WordPress since February, but what has struck me
as the biggest problem is the coding standard used.  I've written a
longer piece[1] about it on my blog, but to summerize:

* Global variables are used all over the place, making it difficult to
  track the dependencies between various parts of the code.

* There are no comments in vast parts of the core code.  To understand
  the core functions one has to read the body of the functions, which
  is really bad, IMHO.  Doccomments which specify argument and return
  types would be a very good move.

If such a development should be 1.6 or 2.0 I don't know, but I do
think that WordPress should look into it's guts and make the code as
good-looking as the XHTML it produces.

Additionally, when well commented there are scripts that will create 
function refs automatically. That'd be pretty sweet.

Would a set of patches that added documentation in a format such as phpDocumentor [1] be welcome?

If so I'm quite willing to sit down and work on them as a way of giving back to the community

I'm not sure how best to address your concerns, except to say that the 
codebase of WordPress is very mature (from b2 goes back almost 4 years?) 
and such over time it has development a number of idiosyncratic quirks 
that may seem strange to a newcomer.

I'm as aware as inconsistencies as anyone, like post.php not using the 
wp_insert_post function, but the highest priorities in development are 
focused at our two primary audiences, end-users (who never look at core 
code) and plugin authors (who use the documented APIs). If you want to 
be a core hacker, then you'll have to get used to some different 
stylistic tendencies. However entries such as yours (which I've seen 
dozens of) are akin to someone coming into your house and criticizing 
where you put all your furniture and organize your books.

If you look at code from much older releases, like .71, you'll see that 
it gets cleaner and more streamlined with every release (less global 
usage, etc), but things usually get cleaned up when another improvement 
is happening to that part of the code. Rewriting things for no good 
reason other than rewriting them tends to introduce bugs. Bugs hurt both 
of our core audiences.

Commenting is tricky. Some "well-commented" code I've seen had a bunch 
of lines of repetitive filler that "documented" what you could easily 
see by just looking at the code itself and doubled the size of the 
program. APIs should be documented religiously, but I think spending a 
ton of time on redundant comments for code only a few core hackers will 
ever look at will bloat the codebase and waste everyone's time. I also 
believe that well-written code usually doesn't need comments unless it's 
doing some sort of voodoo or workaround. (See gettext.php.) If you're 
doing something that is so long and complicated that it needs a lengthy 
explanation, it probably is worth breaking it into several simpler pieces.

I think if we surveyed our users, very few (if any) would bring up the 
"coding standard" as an issue they care about. We need to focus more on 
things like the excellent issues Mark J. raised in his response.

Yes, I've seen that kind of code too and that's just stupid.

Is this not a rather bad example?  I mean, that file comes from an
external project, who obviously know how to write proper doccomments.

And the idea that there can be such a thing as well-written code
containing no comments is bogus: it is only in small toy examples that
the function and argument names are enough to determine what a
function does.

Comments are *very* important in a weakly-typed language like PHP
where you cannot tell anything at all from looking at the function.

Sure, that's classical features --- but having a well-commented code
is also a feature, and for attracting developers and plugin authors I
believe that clean code is a very attractive feature.

Comments are _extremely_ helpful to fledgling programmers and hackers.
I've been cutting my programming teeth on WordPress, and it's been an
awful lot of trial and error as I work through the code at different points.

For some things, it's enough to look at a function name and it's list of
accepted arguments, plus its return value.  But the return value can be
sent back at several different points along the way, which means I need
to work through the function to see what may be returned, and where.

For other things, it can be quite a challenge to determine what's
happening, and why.

I'd love to see all the functions at least have a modest comment block
stating accepted input, and what it returns.  This would help other
fledgling coders.  Yes, it will bloat the file sizes a bit, but text
compresses well, and comments won't add any delay to program execution.

Having read that piece, there was a lot of questionable advice in there. 
I hope the intent isn't to implement it all just because it came from
someone claiming to be an expert.  Beware "usability experts", they are
much like the engineers who design cash registers for your local grocery
store.  They spend all their time in the lab, and don't actually shop in
grocery stores.  For example, the elimination of pop-up windows
(regardless of their purpose) has been a major usability feature added
to browsers at the direct request of *users*.  The paper submitted here
was in favor of making a step backward, by adding such abominations to
WordPress.  That most assuredly would detract from, rather than enhance
the user experience.

Like the replies said, it's not a WordPress issue.

However, a little script could be written that evaluates the hosting setup 
and makes recommendations, or even carries out some simple fixes such as 
creating null index.php files everywhere.

Not it! :-)

I agree. The obessive phpDocumentor style comments just adds far too
much bloat to the code. I'll vouch for general comments to point out
where the code is going, along with specific comments that explain
individual lines if, like you said, 'it's doing some sort of voodoo or
workaround.' The general comments are still pretty important in my
mind, though, so don't discount comments in all cases apart from a
select few.

Of course not. 'Work on' is not the same thing as 'Implement unquestionably'.

But don't discount the feedback. The admin interface has a lot of
possible improvements, and just because someone points them out
doesn't mean we should shoot the messenger down. That isn't going to
help anyone. Of course, I don't agree with everything in there, but
things like replacing the numerical user-level system with brief
descriptions sounds like a good idea.

As other answered in the forum thread I think it's a sysadmin issue
more than a WP issues, a solution for a standard installation shoudl
be to have a special index.php that redirect to main index.php but i
doen't see it as a serious "security" issues

Hm, and I was just reading something about how WordPress doesn't take
security seriously. And this is such a simple fix, too... Options
-Indexes in .htaccess, for instance. A blank index.html or something
for those sites where .htaccess won't work.

Provided "Override Options" is allowed in .htaccess -- if not, you get
a server error.  A blank "index.html" or "index.php" is assuming that
one or the other is included in DirectoryIndex ("index.html" is the
default, so I guess that would be a better choice than "index.php").

There are so many ways to misconfigure a web server that I'm not sure
implementing workarounds for the possible mistakes is time well spent.

I think "Options None" should work fine with WordPress, so the install
document could include a section about Apache configuration recommending
that.  I guess "AllowOverride FileInfo" should be mentioned, too.

Regards,
+ Kim

I second this. Given local context it is difficult to figure out the  
proper pre- and post-conditions. And in this case JavaDoc style  
comments can be very helpful.

Internal documentation (and code-cleaning) shouldn't be a top  
priority, but if there are people who are ready and willing to work  
on it, I'd say let them go for it.

phpnuke is more well known for its security flaws than for its security concerns.

I sincerily do not want to start a troll or anything. I'm sure Gabriel is a
very cool person to hang out with and that he has a keen artistic sense when
it comes to making a button look pretty. It's just that when it comes to
usability and HCI, I encourage you to trust someone else.

I kept this to myself when the report was released, but sincerily...
WordPress is a publishing software. Anyone with a clue in usability would
have pointed out three obvious and major points:

- A preview button is missing in the default package
- A spell checker is missing in the default package
- A wysiwyg editor is missing in the default package

Yet, the 'expert' missed all three. He instead concentrated on hardly
significant details such as the looks of external links.

What more, many of his suggestions were irrelevant. For instance, it's
immediate to notice that users go to the admin section to check for news,
for comments in need of moderation and for links from the dashboard. And
then head straight to create new post, page or link.

A clueful expert would have suggested to put more focus on the dashboard's
main uses, and that the three relevant 'New' links should be available in
one click where the Dolly text is at. And with a minimum of common sense, he
would have suggested to make the three links available from the blog when
the user is logged in, near the link to the admin menu.

That said, Gabriel arguably isn't too bad at self promotion and public
relations.

My $.02.

I would like to read it too, I didn't see any serious exploit in WP
code till now (i mean in 1.5.x) the serious bugs were related to
funtionality not security.

I agree that adding a blank index.php in dirs that have not to be
readable is an easy thing to do, on other front (.htaccess) it's
really technical, depending a lot by the web server setup etc, the
average user will probably get lost making changes that turn the
installation totally unasable. Better let this to web hosting help
desk ;)

Since WordPress itself relies on index.php being a functional
DirectoryIndex, we can safely assume that blank index.php files will
function correctly inside our sub-directories.  This is an easy thing to
do to calm some reactionary folks.

Better still, perhaps, to make these subordinate index.php files
redirect to the main blog page.

If we had a diff it would make merging easier.

BTW, as far as exploits on the 1.5 codebase, there was one, an SQL
Injection vunerability in wp-trackback.php. Although not easily
exploitable, it still exist(ed). I don't remember if this got fixed or
not, but I do remember seeing it on the gentoo bug tracker

That diff took care of a tb_id vulnerability, which is the only
wp-trackback related vulnerability that I am aware of.

I find that it helps to import 3rd party software into a vendor branch
so that it is easier to produce diffs between the imported version and

- the modified version used locally
- future vendor versions

Just my 0.02e  :-)

Gabe's recommendation to use popup's is questionable to be sure. 
However, this does not invalidate any of the other recommendations he 
makes. Rather than discount his paper in it's entirety, evaluate each 
recommendation on it's own merits.

Ron, I find your comparsion to engineers designing cash registers 
amusing. The engineers from your example are, in the case of Wordpress, 
the developers not the usability folks. The role of usability analysis 
is to bridge the gap between people who make things in the lab and 
people who use things in the real world through informed observation 
and decision making.

WP fares reasonably well for usability compared to other OS efforts, 
yet there remains plenty of room for improvement. For example, in the 
manage posts screen:
   * What is the relevance of the id column when using permalinks, is it 
needed?
   * Why are there three buttons (view, edit, delete) for every post, 
when you can only perform one action at a time on only one post?
   * Why do some links dump you into the live blog, while other perform 
admin functions?
   * Why do some buttons have double borders, some are flat, and others 
are text links?
   * Why does the page layout differ when there is one result (i.e. 
comments shown) vs. many results (no comments) when filtering the list?
   * Why is the main navigation a mixture of task orientation ("do 
something") and functional orientation ("work in this area")?

All of these questions can be answered by usability engineering or, if 
you prefer a different label, interaction design. Some are visual 
design issues, while others are software engineering issues. They all 
impact on usability and regardless of what label you use, at the very 
least there should be some sort of deliberate  and informed effort in 
addressing these issues in WP prior to the next milestone release.


regards Terrence Wood.

Hi Denis,

Thanks for your comments. I'm glad to see that people are taking the
report I produced seriously.

I think that your comments about the topics that I overlooked are
valid, and this is one of the reasons I released the report as a draft
(but time commitments have meant that I haven't been able to update
it).

I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at here, so if you can
elaborate this for me, that would be great.

As for self-promotion, I have the luxury of getting the jobs that I
dream of without needing to go crowing about myself. So that wasn't my
motivation at all. This report was my first foray into giving back to
the OSS community that has given me some really cool software.

Like Terrence said in a subsequent post, take a look at each of the
recommendations and evaluate them.

First off, I'd like to apologize for the cold wording. No offense was
intented, just a mere pique. And I feel like a sorry jerk for having been so
cutting.

http://redwing.hutman.net/~mreed/warriorshtm/jerk.htm

Regarding your question, user behavior is goal driven, implying that the
easier and faster a software allows him to fulfill his goal, the more
usable.

Now, notice the way you suggest to reorganize the admin menu. You group
similar items together and you add a menu level. This makes sense from a
classification stand point.

However, I'm afraid it doesn't make sense when you take a closer look at
user requirements. The key requirements (say, 80% of the accesses to the
admin menu?) are:

- Create new post, page, link
- List of new comments
- (for multi-user blogs) List of new posts
- Check latest WP/Blog news in dashboard
- Moderate comments, quickly get rid of spam

Edit post, edit page and edit comment are very common too, but I count them
out because you typically access these via edit links on the blog.

The secondary requirements (say, 80% of the remaining accesses?) are:

- Manage posts, pages, links (as in: change category, page template, etc.)
- Create/Manage post and link categories
- (for multi-user blogs) Create/Manage users
- (for the more geeky) Play around with plugins

So in the end, the admin menu is not so bad in its current state. The
dashboard set aside, the main improvement would be to ease access to those
things that users use the most, i.e. create new post, page, link. For
instance, a quick jump menu could make it more immediate to navigate to the
admin menu's key areas:

  New: Post - Page - Link | Dashboard | Logout

Arguably, the blog could use the menu as well. I got extremely positive
feedback when I added this to the theme I'm maintaining.

Also, the suggestion to place the menu where the Dolly text is at is
everything but random. Top corners are among the more valuable areas in
terms of screen real estate, because they get eye focus even when users
probe a screen.

I don't know about you, but I approve moderated comments far more often
than I post new items.  So a quick link to my moderation queue would be
more useful for me, shaving three clicks:
* click my wp-admin bookmark
* click Manage
* Click Moderation

Admittedly, I could bookmark my moderation queue and click right in; but
that's not my preferred solution.

I also approve moderated comments more than posting new items.  (And it 
bugs the crap out of me that when I approve from email it doesn't show 
the comment I approved in the list any more, so I have to re-locate the 
email, copy the URL, and pste it into the address box to leave a reply.)

A dynamic CSS/javascript menu instead of the static one that's there 
would save me a ton of clicking, and would make all parts of the admin 
interface equally accessible.

Well, personally, I tend to edit pages far more often than anything, but
then I'm not a good example as I'm using WP as a CMS rather than as a
blogware.

Regarding the comments, I use my fuzzy recent comments plugin to access them
from the sidebar. That way, I get a 1-click access to all comments, grouped
by post. I'm in the process of making the v3, which will list -- and
emphasize -- comments in need of moderation to admin users, grouped by post
for easy access. It makes more sense imho than a quick link to the list in
the admin menu, which I only find useful for mass moderation (e.g. getting
rid of an IP). I'm also considering to insert a 'delete' link next to the
'edit' link for comments in my menu template, so as to get redirected to the
originating post rather than to the admin menu when I delete a comment.

Not me, I tend to create a lot of posts, and get very few comments to 
moderate. Should I assume I am a more 'typical' WordPress user, with few 
readers/commenters? (Oh, the shame!)

I think that a customizable dashboard is the way to go...

I typically write entries and check on the moderation queue on my main 
blog but on another blog, i write and edit pages more often.

Thanks! Does it only work with WP 1.5.1.1?

WP-Cron, the underpinnings for the Future Pings plugin, works on 1.5+;
but for Future Pings to function as advertised you do need 1.5.1.1.

If you can't / won't upgrade to 1.5.1.1, you could apply the necessary
change to /wp-admin/post.php yourself:

cool. I've been working on something similiar and have a solution that  
works with `register_shutdown_function` calling lynx to load a php  
script.... unfortunately, AFAIK, it's not platform agnostic (I don't  
know if lynx is standard on IIS), and it's only testing on my local box  
and dreamhost.

lynx isn't a server thing, its a plain program, one that Windows is bound 
not to have, so good luck with cross-platform work.

But on windows, you can't specify it in your $PATH or anything afaik, so 
just calling 'lynx' on a commandline would do nothing. ;-)

Hi Denis,

I appreciate the apology. No offense was taken.

I agree that making posts and moderating comments are the two most
important (and frequent) actions. Managing existing content then comes
second.

Maybe the thing that was missing in my document was the statement of
something along the lines of "the second level item would be selected
by default" - i.e. that if you selected "Comments", the default
selection would be "Awaiting moderation". That is, it wouldn't take
two clicks to get to comment moderation. Same goes for all the other
parts of my proposed IA.

I've gone for sticking most of the other stuff under Configuration
because these are things that are not frequently accessed in most
cases and are a distraction in the current IA.

So, the result is a better organized IA, along with efficient access
to the important stuff.

So, given my clarification above, I'm not sure that the issue you
raise is still a major concern.

BUT, the IA was the one part of the document I would have liked to
spend longer working on. And I'm not wedded to my proposal. I think
that the key things to achieve in a redesign are:

- Quick posting, comment moderation
- Quick content management
- Grouping together config stuff that's now scattered around the place

Given that direct access to posting and comment moderation is
available from the standard horizontal navigation, I'm not sure it's
necessary to provide additional links on the body of the dashboard
page; this is likely to cause confusion. Though contextual access to
these actions (i.e. if new comments listed on the Dashboard looked
something like "Gabriel on Latest Post - Approve | Delete | Edit")
could be a useful thing to explore.

Hey lets just take all responsibility off of the end user, or their
webhost and do everything ourselves!  Geez people, why should we be
held responsible for a mis-configured web-server?

Put it this way: linux users can deal with dependancies, Windows can't
(generally). If lynx doesn't come by default on Windows, it's unlikely
your average user will want to download it.

Well that particular issue that Ryan referred to was a security hole
within Wordpress that could have been exploited as looking at the diff
it wasn't checking to see if $tb_id was an integer or not and could
have been used for an SQL injection attack on the query: SELECT
ping_status FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE ID = $tb_id, it would be easy
enough to terminate that query and then piggy back a DROP DATABASE
statement on the end of it without the proper checking that was added
with the patch.

Now the issue with displaying the contents of directories that is a
different story, that isn't even really much of a security problem
anyway, if you have stuff in those directories you don't want anyone
to know about then you already have a problem right there. Security by
obsfucation as we all know isn't security at all and that is all what
hiding directory contents accomplishes.

Regards,
Jason

I thought it was obvious I was referring to the directory listing
issue, since the $tb_ bit was an obvious problem...

Good Idea. It would also be great to turn help off for experience

I'm not sure why you are quoting my message in your reply.  I was simply
correcting the misinformation that there is no PATH in Windows, or that
it cannot be modified.

WP Database Manager uses passthru() which eliminates it from
consideration.  Mark's backup plugin eliminates the need for passthru()
by stealing code from phpMyAdmin and making use of PEAR/Tar.  It might
make for a better candidate.

i cannot speak for the quality or appropriateness of the guts of the WP 
Database Manager plugin but i like the interface.

I've posted a link in the meetup notes to screenshots of One Click 
Backup as well to add to the discussion.

There seemed to be no-one ideal to quote. I would have quoted further
up the discussion, but the discussion had moved on from there, so I
quoted at the end. I realise that your response only served the
purpose of pointing out there is a PATH in Windows, and I realise it
was something of an inappropriate quote as my response was really
directed at you.

Sorry :)

Message-ID: <aa74b19105052704125bc8ba41@mail.gmail.com>

This is a request for feedback, I guess. 

Multiple installs were too much bother, so I wrote this multi-blog plugin:

    <http://rephrase.net/days/05/05/wordpress-multiplied>

I couldn't find anything similar (just drop it in and go).

It works, though comment notification links in emails are broken at
the moment, and getting pingback working requires two small edits to
wp-blog-header.php. Per-blog themes, plugins, users etc. work fine.

Anyhow, I was hoping someone could glance over it for gaping security
holes I missed. It abuses the plugin system to give per-blog user
levels, for example, which has some pretty obvious ramifications if I
screwed it up.

Feedback on UI issues, functionality, optimizations etc. is also welcome.

Thanks in advance. :)

As an aside, is there much chance of getting hooks/filters added to
the core if they're not likely to get heavy use? There's some really
dodgy code in here that uses cookies and referrers to get on-post edit
links to work *some* of the time, for instance, and it'd be much more
reliable if replaced with an edit_post_link filter or similar. Adding
more hooks was one of the things that came up the other day in the
list of suggestions for 1.6, but is it worth asking for stuff that
probably no-one else is going to need? (How often have any of you
wanted a delete_category hook? Thought so. ;)

It looks like a neat solution.  WPMU, vhosts, and multiply all aim to
solve similiar, but slightly distinct, problems.  More solutions in this
space is a Good Thing(tm).

I'm not the authority on the matter, but plugin hooks are pretty cheap,
computationally: if nothing is registered against that hook it becomes
basically a no-op at execution.  Submit a diff to trac.wordpress.org
with an explanation of the value of the new hook, and you might get lucky!

Message-ID: <42971CDF.9060201@skippy.net>

When was 1.5.1.2 released, and what's in it?

I don't track Trac (ha!), so it came as a surprise to me when I say
1.5.1.2 on the /download/ page.

Is a formal announcement pending, or are all WP users going to be
expected to manually visit /download/ on a regular basis to check for
the latest version?

If the query variable 'cat' was non-numeric (e.g. 'ALL'), after applying
intval to it it would be 0 (zero).

Uppercasing the result of intval() would never match 'ALL' (or any
other string), so the comparison is actually a constant false, i.e. the
condition after && is always true.

>From what I understand the code still works correctly, but that second
condition could just be removed due to being a constant.  (The !empty()
check is sufficient due to all strings becoming zero in the intval()
call.)

In addition, it could be noted that passing 'all' or any other string
(or zero) as 'cat' in the query variables results in all categories
being shown.

Obviously something very important came up that necessitated a release, 
and we wanted to double-check the fix before making a formal 
announcement. The timeline is Report -> 40 minutes -> Release -> next 
morning -> announcment. The code wasn't able to be immediately reviewed 
last night because it was 12 AM on the west coast and most of the other 
devs had already gone to be for the night. Thank you for your 
attentiveness, but a little benefit of the doubt at times would be 
appreciated too.

Matt: I give you benefit of the doubt all the time.
This isn't a personal attack on you: it was a question about procedure.

I understand the need to get fixes out; but I don't think un-documented
releases provide much value to users.  Worse still, the /download/ page
has conflicting version numbers: the headline reads 1.5.1.2, while the
body text reads 1.5.1.1.

"Old guard" and newbies alike are left scratching their heads.

Is there a body of WordPress contributors you trust enough to form a
Security Team?  Between all of us, I'm sure a reasonable selection of
qualified participants can be available to review urgent items like
this, and to help draft update notifications.

That was a typo that was fixed. The release is not undocumented, it is 
being documented and priorities are being dealt with.

I can continue responding to your emails saying "why isn't the 
announcement written?" or I can finish writing the announcement. Your 
pick. In the future when you're impatient or confused feel free to send 
an email directly instead of cluttering up the public lists once again. 
There are more appropiate and less annoying fora for trivial questions 
of "procedure."

Yes there is.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Strange file permissions
Message-ID: <002501c562f8$542d3ef0$6401a8c0@k9>

Hi,

Not sure if it's Wordpress doing it, but my WP file permissions keep changing to 755 of their own accord, even after I've reset them to 644. It could be WP (1.5.1-RC-2.7182818), or it could be something else. I've searched through all the files in the distrib to find a chmod 755, but there is no reference to this. Only the WP .php files are affected (plugins included). Files unrelated to WP are not affected. I'm stumped as to what's doing this.

And one more thing, I get an empty 'test' database appearing in my database every now and then. I'd drop it, then sometime later (not sure how long - days, months) it'd reappear.

So far with these weird events, nothing bad has happened but I'd still like to know what's causing all this. Any insights would be great. Thanks!

The first is because of the default umask that PHP/the server is  
running under.

The test database is the first database that MySQL makes and by  
default everyone has permissions to touch and create a "test"  
database unless that permission is specifically removed.

  wp_post_out_start
and
  wp_post_out_end

...Or something along those lines.  The concept is actions that (in future 
templates, or added to current ones) would execute inside the post DIV, one 
right at the start, one right at the end.  I'm working on plugins that allow 
you to insert custom content into The Loop without editing the template, and 
figure why have people call a custom function, when they could just have 
do_action('wp_post_out_end');   Y'know what I mean?  Seems like sprinkling 
new action hook locations is more useful than adding another function call 
directly because:

1. it insulates the 'disabling plugin wrecks the template' issues.
2. it allows for further plugin development to extend across templates, 
making better plugins AND themes.  might even spark ideas for plugins when 
you see where you can insert things dynamically.
3. as templates add the 'generic' actions, switching themes should retain 
functionality.

Thoughts?  Are those names self-explanatory?

Thanks,

Even with the simple hooks we have already in the templates, lots of 
plugin authors have had to deal with the hooks not being there because a 
theme doesn't contain them. It's also a slippery slope to go down, in 
theory we could have a hook between every HTML element on the page, but 
that'd be pretty silly.

A better solution might be...

Scan the plugin file for function definitions, then scan the templates 
and warn the user before actually deactivating the plugin that there are 
still function calls in their templates.

1. I figured better to use a new action hook that others might start to use and spread, rather than a custom function.
2. Applying filters to the_content doesn't work (needs to be able to insert before the start of the post data, like before the title, and after the body, like after the posted-in -- or 'between' posts, if that's clearer ;) ).  Also breaks if the person uses the_excerpt. ;)
3. I'm not assuming a hook is preexisting in the slightest -- but wouldn't we rather people update their current theme to have the "right hooks" that then support LOTS of plugins rather than adding a custom function call PER plugin?  Again, I thought this a better approach.

And maybe we need to start a different thread about 'verification'.  Like testing that THEMES have references to all 'core actions' they should! ;)

    that'd be pretty silly.

    A better solution might be...

    Scan the plugin file for function definitions, then scan the templates 
    and warn the user before actually deactivating the plugin that there are
    still function calls in their templates.

I and many others have tried this multiple times, check the archives. 
Nothing's happened yet, so I assume it probably never will in the near 
future.

This was discussed at the last IRC session. Would you like to volunteer as a 
Theme Gardener? :)

A plugin that depends on standard hooks should not have to include 
documentation on fixing broken themes. A plugin that requires extra, 
non-standard hooks must document the procedure for adding those hooks to a 
theme.

The question of what SHOULD be a standard hooks will always be a balance 
between what the plugin authors WANT (everything) and how far the theme 
authors are willing to go. Either way, it's not a core issue.

If you're REALLY adamant about filtering every little thing, use the output 
buffer and what hooks you have available. Somebody is always going to echo 
something you wanted to filter.

/me climbs back in sopping wet after going overboard.

    Hi,

    Not sure if it's Wordpress doing it, but my WP file permissions keep changing to 755 of their own accord, even after I've reset them to 644. It could be WP (1.5.1-RC-2.7182818), or it could be something else. I've searched through all the files in the distrib to find a chmod 755, but there is no reference to this. Only the WP .php files are affected (plugins included). Files unrelated to WP are not affected. I'm stumped as to what's doing this.

    And one more thing, I get an empty 'test' database appearing in my database every now and then. I'd drop it, then sometime later (not sure how long - days, months) it'd reappear.

    So far with these weird events, nothing bad has happened but I'd still like to know what's causing all this. Any insights would be great. Thanks!
    John Ha




  The first is because of the default umask that PHP/the server is running under.


  The test database is the first database that MySQL makes and by default everyone has permissions to touch and create a "test" database unless that permission is specifically removed.

http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/

Becca was an easy first choice because her themes looks great and they 
were already in the wp-themes.org repository. Mike Little is the new 
theme gardener and he will be adding some more of the GPL themes to the 
repository in the coming days that will end up on the featured themes 
page. We're checking themes for the basic action hooks and making sure 
they function at least as well as the default with regards to pages and 
such.

The order of the themes will be randomized so you get a peek of 
something new every time you visit. The downloads are going through the 
BRAND NEW repository-driven download system which generates the archives 
directly from the repository and also tracks all of the downloads so we 
can provide fun statistics to theme authors. This is the same DL system 
that will be used for the upcoming plugin directory. Hopefully this will 
alleviate some of the bandwidth problems people have been having!

Ideas? Thoughts? Suggestions?

Very sweet. UI wise, I would suggest:

Make each "theme & title & download link" section take up the entire 
post width. That little 30 pixels of extra theme is annoying.

Once that's done, you'll say "How do they know to go to the next post!?" 
Add a JS link that auto-scrolls the pane X pixels left/right for "Next 
Theme" and "Previous Theme".

That would be pretty awesome.



I am, also, suprised that the typical 120x80 thumbs in rows method 
wasn't used (like http://www.bloggingpro.com/wordpress-theme-gallery/ )

This is brilliant, but the presentation is odd.  Can these been done with 
nice screen shots in a vertical list instead of a horizontal list with a 
scrollbar? Simple list.  The scrolling sideways It makes viewing awkward.

Congrats to Mike Little and thanks.

It's so people know to scroll, which you correctly called.

I can put anchors on the page, could you code up the JS using that 
smooth scrolling thing you've got? It would be awesome if we had:

Theme | Theme | Theme | Theme
Theme | Theme | Theme | Theme

--------------------------------


theme box ------->


--------------------------------

              << prev | next >>

When you click on a Theme it should highlight that link and then do a 
smooth scroll to it. (Like on Dunstan's site.)

By the way, credit should go to Chris Messina for the idea for the 
layout for this page.

Matt,
I don't seem able to check-in any changes. I'm using my username
(mikelittle) and password from the forums which seems to work for trac
and worked for mosquito.

Do I need my password resetting or something?

Okay I've basically got this working now, it's pretty sweet.

Bonus points to whoever can make location.hash autotrigger scrolling to 
that ID in the frame, which would make the individual themes more 
linkable. I tried to put something in the ss_fixAllLinks link loop but 
it never triggered SmoothScroll right.

Would something like the attached work? I haven't tested it but it
seems simple enough.

I don't actually think smooth scrolling here would be desirable. When
you enter a specific URL, you expect to be taken to that URL, not
taken to a similar one then redirected to the actual URL you entered.
When you enter /extend/themes/#foo, you expect to be taken directly to
theme 'foo', not taken to /extend/themes/ and be redirected (or
scrolled) to theme 'foo'.

As far as usability is concerned that sideways scrolling is a
nightmare, scroll down, then move your mouse to the left and then
scroll sideways (even worse as the majority of people won't have tilt
scrollwheels), not very intuitive at all and what purpose does it
actually serve to do it that way anyway?

Why not have smaller thumbs along with the name at the top and then
use something like http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05/sack-of-ajax/
to change the theme displayed?

I think it's cool as a gimmick, but has usability problems. It will
become unwieldy long before the site even begins to approach the number
of themes available on Alex King's theme switcher, for example.

The whole point is there will never be as many themes as on the various 
theme switchers.

So the aim isn't to become a themes one-stop-shop, but to act as a
showcase for the "best" themes? What's the selection process?

I sometimes want to access other data from the post before applying a
filter, because the result would depend on the context. And with the current
system, well... You just can't.

Imho, a more correct approach would have been something like:

$post = apply_filters('post_main', $post);
$post = apply_filters('post_meta', $post);

$comment = apply_filters('comment_main', $comment);
$comment = apply_filters('comment_meta', $comment);

Or even something along the lines of:

$post->apply_filters('post_main');

The '_main' filter would be used when a post or a comment is displayed as
data in its own right. The '_meta' filter would be used when the post is
displayed in a recent posts list, for instance. Likely, there is room for a
'_excerpt' filter that is in between. Nonetheless, I would expect there is
little or no need for formatting filters beyond this.

Was there any discussion in the past regarding a step in this direction? If
so, I'd be curious to know why it was rejected.

There are already seperate filters for the_title, the_excerpt,
the_content and so on. What exactly are you asking?

He is asking for hooks for content based on where it is used on the site, 
like the post_main would be when its displayed on the home page, post_meta 
would be when its in the sidebar, etc.

Well, I can filter the_title, straight and simple. But if I want to filter
the_title this way when post meta blah blah is this, and that way when it's
that, but not when that other post meta is so... WordPress will only allow
this via global variables. Add then, if you add a few more constraints, as
in do not interfere with the next main loop on the page or with the recent
posts loop used a bit later.

Also, it makes more sense to just keep track of a half dozen formatting
plugin hooks, rather than several dozens.

Wait a sec. You want to change formatting of "the_title" when the post 
has a meta key of X value, and do it differently when it has a post meta 
key of Y value? That should be possible...

function title_meta_filter($r) {
	global $id;
	if( get_post_meta($id, 'meta_keyX', true) ) {
		//filter for X
	} else if( get_post_meta($id, 'meta_keyY', true) ) {
		// filter for Y
	}

	return $r;
}

Something like that should do the trick in that case.

Or are you seeking something else?

Well, in my case, it was more on the lines of apply smart links this way
when the post is the 'main' post, and that way when it is not. I predict
disasters in the long term for relying on wp globals to do this.

Likewise, feedwordpress changes the url of all of the permalinks of my
recent posts plugins when I enable the 'posts point to their original
source' option.

In any event, the point remains. To take the example of my recent comments
plugin, I would feel much more comfortable with:

$comment = apply_filters('comment_meta', $comment);

Than with:

if ( $comment->comment_author != '' )
	$comment_author = apply_filters('get_comment_author',
$comment->comment_author);
else
	$comment_author = apply_filters('get_comment_author',
$anonymous_name);
$comment_author = apply_filters('comment_author', $comment_author);
$comment_author_email = apply_filters('get_comment_author_email',
$comment->comment_author_email);
$comment_author_email = apply_filters('comment_author',
$comment_author_email);
$comment_author_url = apply_filters('get_comment_author_url',
$comment->comment_author_url);
$comment_author_url = apply_filters('comment_url', $comment_author_url);
$comment_date = mysql2date($date_format, $comment->comment_date);
$comment_date = apply_filters('get_comment_date', $comment_date);
$comment_date_normalized = mysql2date('Y-m-d H:i:s',
$comment->comment_date);
if ( $comment->comment_type == '' )
	$comment->comment_type = 'comment';
$comment_type = apply_filters('get_comment_type', $comment->comment_type);
$comment_excerpt = apply_filters('get_comment_excerpt',
$comment->comment_content);
$comment_excerpt = apply_filters('comment_excerpt', $comment_excerpt);
$comment_excerpt = strip_tags($comment_excerpt);
$comment_excerpt = preg_replace( "/\s+\S{". ($max_word_length+1)
.",}(\s|\S)+/", "...", $comment_excerpt);
$comment_excerpt = preg_replace ( "/^\s*(\S+(\s+\S+){". ($excerpt_length-1)
."})(...)?\s*(\S|\s)*/", "$1...", $comment_excerpt);

There's two things involved here: iffy programming, and not enough control 
of filters. ;)

At some level what Denis is asking for is more control of when filtering is 
done on certain types of content.  However, I'm guessing that the 
permutations may be highly complex...

On the iffy programming side, KNOWING that other plugins might filter a 
given field, OR that other data MIGHT need to be left intact, a plugin can 
be engineered a bit, well, 'smarter'.  For instance, FeedWordPress could 
have (should have!) embedded something into a meta field of its posts, so 
that when it DOES go to rewrite urls, it ONLY does it on ITS posts... That's 
just plain common sense, versus 'shortcuts' to not code the more proper 
solution.

I think the filters/actions stuff needs to be expanded, but not sure what is 
truly needed.  This won't be a quick process, probably something to put on 
the v2 list but start discussing now. ;)

One thing that might be useful is an optional param for 'where' the filter 
is being applied from (in theory, something like main (loop), secondary 
(loop), sidebar, etc.).  Add to that all requests for data are migrated to 
specifying their 'where' location, and you're close.  Also, could then 
request data without filtering maybe, or better would be to have plugins 
specify whether they are core/required filters or secondary processing. 
Something like that.  Dunno, just brainstorming here! ;)

Mm, actually, it does something along the lines of what you say already:

A) global $post;
B) Check for appropriate meta
C) Change permalink

So that when my recent comment plugin comes by, the same filter goes:

A) global $post; (still set to last in loop)
B) Check for appropriate meta (false positive)
C) Fuck things up

The real issue imho is to reduce the number of plugin hooks rather than
expand them, to make them more rigorous (more consistency in naming), and to
give developpers more control on the way they are applied. Hence my
suggestion to use something along the lines of:

$post = apply_filters( 'post_meta', $post );

With a couple of hooks that define the main contexts of use. To the plugin
developper, it makes two difference:

- There are few hooks to know, as opposed to many
- You change $post->post_title rather than $title, and return $post
- You can filter things based on the context

So far everything has been a bit hazy for me, but this is starting to 
come across. The idea of filtering content based on context is nigh 
impossible.

The big assumption here is that there are only two types of display. 
_main and _meta - this, however, is very much not the case. In my site I 
have several different instances in which I use the excerpt of a most 
for different things. To put it in context, I have _main, _summary, and 
_single.

I don't think that could be accounted for.

However, as to WordPress's reliance on globals, we're in the same boat 
-- more object passing, less confusion, more reliabilty.

Hopefully this should help people out with the bandwidth trouble they've

As many of you know as of 1.5 the link update system started using the 
Ping-O-Matic API instead of processing the 3MB+ changes.xml file. This 
was a lot faster for everyone, and weblogs.com seems to be stabler since 
we stopped all the WP blogs from hitting it all the time, but as several 
people noted the PoM API was only returning blogs that it knew about, 
which was much fewer than go through Weblogs.com. Anyway it's all the 
same now, Ping-O-Matic is now parsing several sources including 
weblogs.com for update information, so the quality of updates should be 
as good or better as when everyone was manually parsing changes.xml.

Can this, or something like it, be used to download specific
tags/branches? I tag my releases by version number, and do development
on the trunk or on the branch, so this is not very useful to me just
yet!

Precisely my thoughts too. Also, I tried downloading some, but I always
get an error when trying to unzip them:

[/tmp/authimage.zip]
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of /tmp/authimage.zip or
        /tmp/authimage.zip.zip, and cannot find /tmp/authimage.zip.ZIP,
period.

But don't get me wrong, this sounds excellent : ).

Ahem.

However people who have non-numeric tags are probably going to be 
generally out of luck, as there's no good way to tell which is the 
latest and greatest.

This should be working now.

Also, downloads update about every twenty minutes.

Get everyone to create a 'latest' symlink in the tags directory that
points to the latest tag? That's pretty standard behaviour.

Or, at least, create a simple interface to allow users to specify
which is the latest tag, then create the simlink automagically.

Great, thanks. One more thing: why does the most recently downloaded
package go to the top of the list? It makes things confusing IMHO; it'd
be much better to keep things alphabetical so that plugins are easy to
locate.

Cool! Great idea.

Have you fixed the "www." subdomain problem, too?

Message-ID: <24d658f4debe708d52512edf008ac9ac@michelf.com>

Hi,

I've written an analysis explaining why it is so difficult to integrate 
*correctly* an alternate syntax into WordPress. It's all done in the 
perspective of Markdown. It explains all the workarounds I have to 
implement to correct existing problems in the plugin.

I wrote this in part hopping it will inspire someone to improve the 
text filtering system for WordPress. The current one is very powerful, 
but in my experience it's a mess to work with.

If you read it, don't forget to take a glance at the text-flow diagram 
I made. Here is the text:

It was ordering based on # of downloads, now it's alphabetical.
