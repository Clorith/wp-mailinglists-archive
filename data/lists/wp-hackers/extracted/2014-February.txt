Subject: [wp-hackers] transients and non utf 8 chars
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2o3X_frAspNOj-rqVOUg+2U3fWOMXwUj_J_HDY-JuMSg@mail.gmail.com>

I stored 10 news items in a bulleted list HTML in a transient.
One of the news items was this:

Century of Violence:?What World War I Did to the Middle East

When I retrieve the transient and display it on the screen, browser stops
displaying the stored html exactly at

Century of Violence:

That is right before that funny char "?".

I was grabbing the text on the fly from another web site which I have full
control over. (I will go ahead and fix the code on that site as the why the
heck we got that funny char to begin with in there so it won't be a problem
) but... I'm still interested in how deal with this kind of stuff...

Is there a way to run the transient HTML ( beofre it gets stored ) thru
some sort of a utf8 filter that would filter out such unwanted chars? -
even better - replace'em with *reasonable alternatives* from the utf8
world.This way, no matter what the original text contains we can be sure
that it will be tamed.

how do you deal with such problems?

Greetings all,

I heard about an interesting library some time ago called Zepto js. It's
apparently a very lightweight, jQuery-compatible library that in some cases
can be much faster than jQuery (see http://www.greensock.com/js/speed.html)

Considering that the only downside of this seems to be that it doesn't
officially support ancient IE9 or older browsers, I was curious if
Wordpress developers had considered swapping it out or using some other
jQuery alternative at some point in the future?

Best regards,
Luke

Hi Luke,

That's a little bit off the topic, but I don't think IE 9 is ancient - I
personally don't use it, but I think IE 9 is a browser that should be
supported(IE 8 is questionable, but I don't bother with it).
It's fine for a specific project(where you have a target audience) to drop
support for IE 9, but it's not acceptable to do so in a massively used
product such as WordPress.

Besides - you can always use Zepto.js in your projects - I assume you'll
still end-up loading jQuery, since pretty much any plugin that uses
JavaScript on the front(or back)-end uses jQuery.

All the best,
Nikola

Given that IE9 and earlier still represent something like 5-10% of a
random sampling of various browser stats sites, abandoning it is done at
your peril.

All of that, and if you look on the front page of jquery.com you'll see
that WP is listed as a "corporate member". :)

OT to something OT

Sadly some of us are stuck with ie8 (running in compatible mode) due to other more important business system only running on ie7 (we want to upgrade, but our supplies won't upgrade their software). 

Just a reminded that not every one using an old version of ie can upgrade :(

In many organizations the dominant restriction is ANY change, not
specifically what the change is.

I'm several hundred hours in the development of a complex web application
where I would LOVE to rely on only standards capable browsers (e.g. IE10
or greater).  But alas, I'm not sure the target will even have IE8...  And
no amount of push to upgrade -- to ANYTHING -- will gain traction.

Good point, I suppose Zepto wouldn't be compatible with jQuery-dialog and
other plugins as well?

I see that example I gave was using jQuery 1.10 which is probably the speed
difference.

We have no plans to drop jQuery.

Few libraries are more battle-tested than jQuery. They account for things
that most libraries dismiss as edge cases. And yes, that includes edge
cases in "modern" browsers, not just Internet Explorer < 8, 9, 10,
whatever. See also https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7153630. They also
have been moving forward with their jQuery 2.0 branch, along with newer
tools (say, modularization), all which show they are willing to continue to
evolve.

jQuery also keeps our barrier to entry for core development low, because
we're using a common "language" that is easy to understand, ubiquitous, and
handles a lot under the hood so we don't need to. They also well-backed by
a strong team of contributors and they're going to be around for a long
time. And even if it is slower than some other library than may be out
there (note -- jQuery is by no means slow, and even then they've been making
huge strides), it's absolutely worth every penny for the convenience and
wide knowledge factor. All libraries and languages add some sort of
overhead. The key is to weigh whether the performance cost is worth making
things easier. Otherwise we'd all be writing in ARM machine code.

We also happen to have a fantastic relationship with the jQuery core team.
This cannot be overstated. They help us, we help them, and when bugs in
WordPress or jQuery affect the other project, things get escalated and
fixed very quickly (like, in a matter of hours). They also share our
philosophies not only of an open web and a willingness to work everywhere,
but of backwards compatibility. Shared vision is probably the most
important thing to consider when we look at third-party libraries.

Nacin

p.s. If you re-read this replacing '"jQuery" with "WordPress," you could
re-use this as a spirited defense of using WordPress over some other new
hotness. They are the WordPress of JavaScript libraries.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wordpress shortcodes
Message-ID: <CAHERW=3kNokdqfheq+69tdE7w6r7F9A+D_bEVoK0j_bwGfLMfQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a shortcode like this;


    [shortcode
        _arg1="val1"
        _arg1="val2"]
    [/shortcode The way it stands, it does not work.

I know that if I were to remove the carriage returns in between the
attributes, it would work.
but hey, that's not news...

The problem is that I'd like to keep those carriage returns in the post
editor for visually clarify purposes.

I did some tests on built-in shortcodes.

It turns out that [caption] shortcode tolerates any number of empty lines
in between the
args. But audio shortcode on the other hand suffers from carriage returns.

you can copy this section from this email and paste it into a new post and
see it for yourself.
<begin_copy>
caption shortcode example. this works with any number of carriage returns.
It's rock solid.

<hr>

audio shortcode example. this one works in a limited fashion. It works with
one carriage return but fails if there are more than one:

working example of the audio shortcode with no carriage return :

<hr>

working example of the audio shortcode with 1 carriage return :
[audio
mp3="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/demo/_mp3/rain.mp3"
][/audio]

<hr>
Not working example. The following audio shortcode would not work. It does
not like that extra line in its definition. Therefore, you won't be able to
see third audio player.
[audio

mp3="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/demo/_mp3/rain.mp3"
][/audio]

The fact that you do not see that 3rd audio player here puzzles me.. The
question is why is it that extra line causes a problem in the audio
shortcode but that's not an issue in the caption shortcode?

I tried this with many other shortcodes. It looks like none is as robust as
the caption shortcode. Most suffers from carriage returns.

Below also works;

class="size-medium wp-image-6" /> The Great Wave


[/caption]

</end_copy>

My question is two parts.

How can I remove those carriage returns (on the fly) before the WordPress's
shortcode parser kicks in?

And what makes the caption shortcode so robust?

Actually, your caption code doesn't work at all for me. Inserting blank
lines causes the caption to not appear.

The extra blank lines aren't accepted inside shortcodes because the regex
being used for them doesn't like it. If you want to try to sort out why,
then you can examine the regex in the get_shortcode_regex() function.

But there is no functional difference between the caption shortcode and the
audio shortcode, because shortcode functions do not parse their own text,
generally. The core parses the shortcode including the attributes, then
calls the appropriate function to handle it. Shortcode functions never see
those blank lines, they only get an array of attributes.

Not sure why Otto didn't point you to 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14050 but go take a look there, 
too. I put in some work on these problems, not sure whether your 
multi-line attributes use case is something I'm covering so far though.

Since wp_oembed_remove_provider() is basically a wrapper function for the
first example, my choice would be this function.

There was a similar question on WordPress SE (
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19466374/filtering-wordpress-oembed-provider-list)
where the filter was recommended because the user wanted to only allow a
couple of providers.

Ya my example is for only youtube videos.

I eneded up using the 1st one, as I saw the other one was a wrapper.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Static string in permalinks and page with the same
	name, bad?
Message-ID: <CAFaCOgw1aW1rNPHNdEwAq0u0ducRCUVwMRwom161ONRYLr2A=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am using a static string 'archives' in my permalinks. My blog's permalink
structure looks like this: /archives/%postname%/

And my blog has two pages: About me (about-me) and a blank page called
Archives (archives)

In Dashboard > Settings > Reading, the 'Front page displays' option is set
to a static page, with 'about-me' acting as the front page and 'archives'
acting as the blog archive.

Considering that I am already using 'archives' in my permalink structure,
is this to be considered a bad practice?

NOTE: The very reason why I am using a static string in my permalink
structure is to avoid those edge-case performance issues seen when a blog
happens to have a large number of pages with complex relationships
(sub-pages, sub-sub-pages), etc.

With the current settings in place, will the 'static string' still help? Or
should it be changed to something unique (e.g. different from any page,
category, tag, or post slug)?

PS: Would love to know what Otto has to say! =)

best,
Aahan

Those performance issues you speak of were fixed in WordPress 3.3.

Hello Otto,

I should have been more clear. I do know that the performance issues have
been fixed in 3.3. I wasn't talking about that.

If I am not wrong, WordPress builds the rewrite rules and stores somewhere
in the database for quick lookup. So when a post/page is requested in
quickly goes through the rules and shows the relevant page. The complex the
permalink structure, the bigger the no. of rules (or something along the
lines).

I want to make it *as easy/fast as possible* for wordpress to differentiate
between posts, pages and other post types. One way to do it, I read, is to
start the permalink structure with a numeric (Post ID, Year, Month, Date)
or static string (as in my case "archives") and end the permalink structure
with something unique (Post ID or Postname).

Considering that, theoretically, these permalink structures would perform
best (descending order):

- /archives/%post_id% or /archives/%postname%/

- /%post_id%/%postname%/ or /%year%/%postname%/

Of course, I do acknowledge that there are no "performance issues" with
other permalinks, but better is still better, IMHO.

Considering that I am correct so far, does using the static string
'archives' help in *my case*? (Because I also have a page with the same
slug, all explained again below.)

..........

I am using a static string 'archives' in my permalinks, and my blog's
permalink structure looks like this: /archives/%postname%/.

I want a static homepage to be displayed on the home page, so I created two
new pages: 'Home (home)' and a blank page called 'Archives (archives)'. In
Dashboard > Settings > Reading, the 'Front page displays' option is set to
a static page, with the page 'Home (home)' acting as the front page and the
page 'Archives (archives)' acting as the blog archive.

Considering that I am already using 'archives' as a static string in my
permalink structure and there's a page with the same slug, does the static
string actually help as it usually would in normal cases?

Or should the static string be changed to something unique (e.g. different
from any page, category, tag, or post slug)?

I am doing a plain old the_content filter, and instead of returning the

previously, so I am not sure what the issue is.  

The rewrite is for a real state API, maybe some of you have worked with it. 
GOIDX is the name.  I am just rewriting the urls so they look nicer, and was
aiming to auto include the content on page this way.  

Here is the error: Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in

The wordpress title returns a Page Not Found error.  Here is the code in a

Any help is greatly appreciated!

Ah, nevermind. I didn't know that verbose rewrite rules aren't triggered
anymore for permalink structures like /%postname%/ and
/%category%/%postname%/. That makes this question irrelevant. Puff!

Hello,

I have a problem with CPTs. It's not about creating or using them, but
knowing whether they are suitable (or meant) for my use-case.

This is about my personal website. The major part of the site is very
blog-like. I use the permalink structure /%category%/%postname%/ to
organize posts by subject (e.g. notes, science, maths, etc.).

Now I am also planning to list Books and Movies I've read/watched or plan
to read/watch. As for books, I also need three custom taxonomies --
subject, writer, and publisher.

Given the case, should I use CPTs, or simply create 2 new categories
(movies, books) and the three custom taxonomies for use with these
categories? What's the right (or better) way to go about doing it?

PS: I did read Otto's article on this very topic (
http://ottopress.com/2010/wordpress-3-0-and-custom-post-types/), and it
only left me even more confused -- he can only cover so much in a single
post.

CPT are posts. Same behaviors, but they are automatically listed in posts
lists (you need to add code to add them in main query or uses CPT archives).
CPT don't use permalinks with the % category% - only the % postname% will
work out of the box.
So if you plan to deal with those posts to be listed and accounted with
regular posts, just use categories.
If they are going to be on separate lists and pages, use CPT.

Is there a reason you are matching the same rewrite twice?

The first one appears to have a square bracket too many.

Can you line 15 "$matches[1]]" and then update permalinks in your admin

Subject: [wp-hackers] Paypal Donations
Message-ID: <52F650AC.2090306@gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I've just seen a paypal donation form on the ottopress.com website and I 
would like to have something similar on my sites, I've had a nosey at 
the HTML source code and it looks like to be a widget of some sort, but 
I've not been able to find any plugin that has the same options for 
Amount, Currency and so on.

I managed to find the link below but this mentions that you cant have 
the amount, and currency drop downs on WordPress. 
http://en.support.wordpress.com/paypal/

If someone could perhaps point me in the right direction as to how to do 
this, i'd very much appreciate it.

Thanks

You could have just emailed me directly and asked. :)

The widget code I'm using is basically the same as the code here:

Message-ID: <CALh8u3k2310Zkkxjt6AQbKCioVPo7hJ5a6U05oytKxApPVd4Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm just a beginner to wordpress so it might sound a little naive, in
wp-config.php file we have following lines of code just before including
'wp-settings.php'

if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )
define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__) . '/');


Seems useless to me as we already define ABSPATH in wp-blog-header.php and
suppose if we directly open our wp-config.php file then also if it is a
level above the wordpress root directory the ABSPATH is set to the
directory a level above the wordpress root directory which gives a fatal
error when we include the wp-settings.php file in the next step.Can't we do
it like this?

if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )
define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__) . '/');

if(file_exists(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php'))
         require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');


It helps in removing the Fatal error which might occur.

It's actually defined in wp-load.php and the correct way of including just
WordPress(without parsing the request and displaying the correct template)
is actually by including wp-load.php and not wp-config.php.

Basically wp-load.php looks in two locations for wp-config.php:

ABSPATH . 'wp-config.php'

and

dirname( ABSPATH ) . '/wp-config.php'

In the second case, wp-load.php also makes sure that in the directory where
the wp-config.php resides there is no wp-settings.php, because if there is,
that means that this wp-config file is actually part of a different
install.

What I meant was let my wordpress be installed in a location like

http://example.com/web/wp/

but my wp-config.php file (not any other) is in

http://example.com/web/

folder, then if I open

http://example.com/web/wp-config.php

it will give a fatal error on the line :

require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');


because of the condition

if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )
define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__) . '/');


Thanks for pointing out that it is defined in wp-load.php  probably mixed
up the names (being still new to wordpress).

I'm still not sure why you would open wp-config.php :)

wp-load.php was new in WordPress 2.6 when we made it so you could put
WordPress in its own directory but leave wp-config.php outside of it (for
SVN externals & git submodules reasons). The include from wp-config.php is
there for backwards compatibility reasons, and yes obviously doesn't work
in this setup.

@Andrew Nacin
Won't adding this condition be better?


if(file_exists(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php'))
         require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');

That's a wasted stat call to see if the file exists. If the constant is
already defined (as it should be, if wp-load.php is the entry point), then
nothing will happen. If wp-config.php is somehow the entry point and WP
isn't in a subdirectory (by far most common), then it'll still work (this
is the back compat).

Hi! I'm a student from India. I am interested in participating in Google
Summer of Code - 2014 with WordPress.
I want to take up the  "Forms Plug-in" project idea from the ideas page
[1]. Has there been any work on this? I guess that the idea would involve a
Plugin/Widget with a Settings Page to add new Surveys and Forms while also
providing the controls to edit the Saved surveys. Themes for the
Surveys/Forms and Other Complementary things can always be  added later. As
per my understanding, the project would require a good amount of PHP and
WP-based interaction with the MySQL Databases along with JavaScript and
AJAX for Data Validation.

Please correct me on this if I am wrong and advise me on how to get started
and get more acquainted with the community / development process.

- My background -
I have developed two simple plugins for Wordpress [2],[3] and have a fair
knowledge of the process. I have worked on several hobby projects with PHP,
MySQL, JavaScript, AJAX and Python [4]. I have also programmed in C and
Visual Basic and have a know-how of svn. I am on the
SSMS(Student Society For Mess Services)
 committee of my college, in which I'm responsible for developing and
maintaining a data oriented application to handle student billings. I was
also responsible for building a registration portal for an all-India event.

That variable exists if it is an already post and is created from
the $postarr array on extraction. It would be the ID of an existing post if
it is the case.

Line 2719 in posts.php, just above the lines you asked about it.

If empty, it doesn't matter, status becomes new, check line 2742.

You should read the full function as it's pretty selfexplanetory.

Subject: [wp-hackers] special shortcode processing for a certain CPT
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2HE6JU3NJ+jBXfubU7ATfKWAjnEDZD4tL_F4bKCScWWA@mail.gmail.com>

I wish the content of my custom post type to be preserves AS IS all the way
until shortcodes API kick in.

When I run my shortcode in that post type, I'd like that shortcode's
$content variable to 1 to 1 access what I entered.

As of now, I'm getting <p></p> and <br />s plus the &#1234; stuff.

I can use the

remove_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop' ); to take care of the obvious but
I could not figure out a way to take care of the &# stuff.

Are there other processes that turns special chars into their html char
code equivalents, such as

&#8216;
&#8217;
&#8221; and so on?

How do I prevent this from happening so that when the shortcode API gets a
hold of the $content of my custom post type, that content is exactly what
was entered into the text editor?

Well, you can conditionally move the do_shortcode filter higher up just for
that post type(I assume you're expecting those results on the single
template for that post type), but I don't know what side effects this might
have.

I think the &#....; is added by the wptexturize function.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC Idea: WordPress Backup and Migration
Message-ID: <CAF+VQp-0Uk-gErZAC-bytw+06M+JtJQ03de=s0Nvn3w2U4iWMA@mail.gmail.com>

*I know its quite early for presenting and idea, but I am really excited
about WordPress for GSoC 2014. So, here is my idea:*

Current Problem:

   - There are a large base of user who use WordPress for their
   personal/small sites. In most of these cases, they are the only
   administrator and generally have no knowledge about making backups, using
   plugins,...Even a lot of experienced WordPress users make mistake of
   ignoring backups


   - There are lot of cases when the WordPress installation get corrupted
   due to a numerous issues. Because of this, WordPress installation including
   databases get corrupted which cause a big trouble to a lot of peoples those
   don't have backups.


My Idea:

   - There should be *core functionality* that will allows them to make
   backups. Before starting an upgrade, users will asked to create a backups
   and download them.


   - It will also have an inbuilt feature that will check if user is
   restoring a backup on the same directory of same site or not. If website
   URL is different or maybe directory is different, it will automatically
   update the URL's and path's after getting a confirmation from user.


Its functionality:
It will have two functionalities: Backup and Restore

   - *Backup:* There will a form that will ask confirmation from user to
   create a backup. Once confirmed, it will export the database and zip
   database along with all files in an compressed archive and save it in a
   directory chosen by user. It will also prompt user to download the archive.


   - *Restore:* It will be a small wizard that can be loaded after
   extracting a backup on the server and visiting it through the browser. It
   will first check if it is loaded on same URL from which site is backed and
   also if the database exist. If they are different, it will ask for a new
   database setting, restore database settings and finally correct the links
   if site is on a different URL.


Advantages:

   - It will encourage users to create backup before upgrading WordPress.


   - Corrupted WordPress installation and hacked sites can also be easily
   restored by users.


   - Since it will be a core functionality, a lot of people who are not
   aware of making backup and making will start creating backups.


   - Creating backups will not require much technical knowledge so the
   process will be smooth for even beginner users.


   - Lastly, it will helpful to people who are planning to change their
   domain names, web host or the developers who generally keep develop on
   their PC and later upload it to the hosting service.


If you have any question or feedback, please let me know.

*Thanks,*

order to bypass the error (The HTTP response test get an error "Peer 
certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates").

Mi question is, would this harm the regular use of the SSL certificate 
for the rest of the web? (validation of logins for example)

Thanks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Importing from xml
Message-ID: <CAHERW=2_VNP7b20UFERUVezYy0QxXNsnNbTNWf+-ia-f03r_MQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm moving one Go Daddy account website into another Go Daddy account
I'm about to do the import xml but the checkbox there which is about the
"important file attachment" is confusing to me.

I already have the uploads folder uploaded to the new empty site.

It appears to me that the export file should have the  image file
name/folder references so my uploading of the backed up upload folder
should just fit right in.

And therefore,  I should not check the import file attachments checkbox but
just wanted to double check with you...

No. This is referring to verification of SSL from a client perspective, it
would not affect your server's ability to send responses to HTTPS clients.

On some server configurations, a "local" request made from a server back to
itself will have a different IP than if the request was coming from an
outside connection. This can be problematic if the request is SSL, because
the certificate won't match up properly.

Turning off the https_local_ssl_verify flag will basically allow it to
ignore this certificate verification failure for local requests only.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Get terms from wp_query when using tax_query
Message-ID: <CABCyq-nd3oq317OhJeYfYRn4mNUZSEyUzReQZj6i5WmD502_sw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I was wondering if there is a smart/quick way to obtain all terms attached
to a post when querying posts through WP_Query();


This is the scenario:

$query = array(
    "post_type" => "post",
    "tax_query" => array(
        array(
            "taxonomy" => "my_tax",
            "fields"        => "slug",
            "terms"       => "my-term"
        )
    )

);
$posts = new WP_Query($query);

It would of great hand if it could also return all terms attached to a post

foreach($posts as $post){
    var_dump( $post->terms['my_tax'] ); // could store all terms grouped by
taxonomy
}

The only way to obtain the same result, as I know, is to loop through each
post and query for terms attached to it:

foreach($posts as $post){
    $post->terms['my_tax'] = wp_get_object_terms($post, 'my_tax'); // very
expensive
}


What do you think? Is there a way to modify posts structure returned by
wp_query without writing custom sql queries?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Two instances of wordpress media library?
Message-ID: <1392224416655-43350.post@n5.nabble.com>

I have a plugin I have been working on, and part of the plugin includes file
uploads (images).  I would like to make the users file uploads visible in
the backend, but without merging all the user content with my admin content. 
Is it possible to load another instance of the media library, as a plugin
option page, and have it contain only files uploaded to it specifically?  

I have already read through the codex, and it appears it is not possible,
but this forum is always full of great answers to hard questions.  If I am
right, and its not possible, are there any alternatives?  I am considering
creating a plugin page named user gallery and styling it similar to the
wordpress gallery- but since I would like to take advantage wordpress' image
uploading, meta data, thumbnails, and other features it makes sense to ask
first.

Hi Deven, thanks for your interest :)

The forms project is something that WordCamp Central (the team that 
organizes the global WordCamp infrastructure and WordCamp.org) has 
talked about and wanted for a long time, but we haven't written any code 
for it yet, so the student who works on it will be able to build it from 
the ground up.

It would be a plugin and would most likely be created around Custom Post 
Types.


> Themes for the

It should be compatible with any theme, but that will mostly happen by 
default. It will require some basic CSS rules to define the generic 
layout of the forms on the front-end, but will inherit most of the 
visual elements from whatever the current theme is.

Definitely good amounts of PHP and the WordPress API, and also some 
JavaScript. AJAX could be involved, but it wouldn't necessarily have to 
be. You can check out the WordCamp Organizer Application to see the kind 
of branching that happens based on how the questions are answered:

http://plan.wordcamp.org/become-an-organizer/organizer-application/

There probably won't be much MySQL (if any); at least not directly. The 
WordPress API handles 99% of that for you. I'd recommend playing around 
with custom post types to get a feel for it:

http://codex.wordpress.org/custom_post_type

Development for WordCamp.org happens on the Meta trac, and most of the 
source code lives in the Meta repository. Other than that, the 
processes, guidelines, etc are similar to the development of WordPress 
itself.

Here's some links if you want to dig deeper:

WordCamps:

- WordCamp.org tickets on the Meta trac
* 
https://meta.svn.wordpress.org/sites/trunk/wordcamp.org/public_html/wp-content/ 
- The SVN repo for WordCamp.org code
* http://central.wordcamp.org/ - The home page for WordCamp.org
* http://plan.wordcamp.org/ - Documentation about WordCamps. Mostly 
geared towards WordCamp organizers, but there's lots of helpful 
background info in there.

WordPress development in general:

Hi Ian! Thanks a lot For Replying so nicely to all my queries!

I will surely go through the links that you have posted and see what I can
take up from there.

Meanwhile, I will state what I had in my mind.

1. A *Settings Page* where you will design the Form through a user friendly
interface like what we use while designing forms using Google Forms. (*Please
suggest if this will be possible to make in the Required Duration* ).

2. The Settings page UI, thus, will be used to make new *Forms with an
unique ID*.

3. The Plugin will have a function to generate *a short code* which will
have *arguments like the Form ID* etc.

4. The user can just go to the *'page/post'* that he wants to add the
survey and *use the Short Code with the right ID *as an argument and get
the survey running. !

Thanks,
Deven Bansod

Hi,

I'm a sophomore student of Mathematics and Computing from India interested
in participating for GSoC 2014 under Wordpress.

I've already thoroughly been through the wordpress ideas
page<http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014>for Gsoc 14. I'm really
interested in working for the "Multisite Plugin-for
sharing database data between sites". I've already been through the links
provided in the description (thanks, were really helpful in giving me an
idea of what you really want). I've a basic layout in mind for the plugin.
I just wanted some guidance regarding some of the more specific
requirements.

I've designed two to three websites on wordpress, one for a national
level entrepreneurial
summit <http://udgam.in/?home=true> held in India. I've also got a fair
knowledge about the wordpress codebase. I've also provided a patch for bug
#23691 <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23691> (yet to be reviewed).
I would further like to work under Wordpress in this GSoC, Hoping for a
positive reply.

Thanks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] the template tags and their default safe contexts
Message-ID: <CAHERW=08Y24JvaYTG+St5hfOW1Pc6pQyYnFDoehvcsf8SdTs=A@mail.gmail.com>

Right off the bat, I'd like to express that this post of mine is not a
criticism of the current system, whatsoever. I know security is a complex
matter.
I'm only trying to get the hang of the issue I will be trying to point out
below to pick your brains for ideas. That's all there is to it.

Having said that...  here we go.

To make my point, I will just pick the template tag the_title().

The the_title() outputs the title.

And it's very easy to learn this fact, thanks to the codex and the
countless articles that are out there.

Since it's a WordPress core function, it's also pretty human to think that
it should be safe to use it is as is. At least, I would not blame the many
who think so, from the get-go.

But the fact of the matter is HTML is a complex thing. And dealing with XSS
or simply writing valid HTML is even more complex. And most people can
easily get lost in this.

Take a look a this piece for instance...

It uses the_title() in a straightforward HTML.

<a href="#" title="<?php the_title(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a>

The question is - Is it safe?

Obviously not...

Well, it is %50 secure. :)

The part within the HTML context ( which will eventually be falling in
between > and < ) is fine but the attribute part ( which will be falling
into title=" and " ) is not.

The the_title() call within the title attribute above is like a military
mines which is waiting to detonate for the wrong title.

Considering so many different contexts, and some many template_tags and so
many esc_ functions, and millions of people out there, what do we do? or
should do?

And what do you guys do to sort this kind of matters when writing your own
template files that outputs stuff? What handle or conventions do you use?

obviously, we do not have
the_title_js()
the_title_attr() and
the_title_html() versions for each and every template tag - which would
follow the esc_API context conventions in a one to one fashion ) as Mark
demonstrates here->
http://wordpress.tv/2011/01/29/mark-jaquith-theme-plugin-security/

I do know the fact that here, we have "the_title_attribute()" available to
us, but hey, you just have to know that.

What if, I needed to use the the_title() within a javascript context as
below. Which way do I go about it - and how do I know  which one would be
allright?
Stackoverflow it?

<Script>
$the_title = '<?php the_title();?>';
$the_title = '<?php esc_js(the_title());?>';
$the_title = '<?php the_title_attribute();?>';
$the_title = '<?php esc_js(the_title_attribute());?>';
</script>

Is the only way to sort this out to know each-and-every-template_tag and
their safe output contexts? Or are there tips or conventions you guys use
to sort these things in a convenient way?

I'm just curious.

Hi Haluk,

I see your point there and I guess that it's a matter of experience and
being aware of things.
Like being aware, that using the_title() is not safe to use within HTML
attribute values. And to know that you should instead use esc_attr(
get_the_title() ) - note the use of get_the_title() - using just
the_title() won't work, since it will output it and not return it :)

If you are aware of the escaping functions and in which cases they should
be used, then that should give you a pretty good start. For instance if you
want to escape text that will go in a textarea, you use esc_textarea().

The best thing to do in my opinion when writing a theme or a plugin
template is to use the correct escaping methods. This way I think that
there are higher chances for the user to keep the escaping functions in
place even if they tweak something on the template.

Subject: [wp-hackers] wp_get_image_editor and updating metadata and
	thumbnail references
Message-ID: <1392636817622-43358.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am making use of the wp_get_image_editor, but am finding the resized image
does not get saved into the media library, or with any metadata, etc...  Is
there a way to store the newly resized images in the library and update the
original image references so the new resized image is referenced as a custom
size? Maybe by name, rather than thumbnail call it newsizethumb, for
example.

The terms for all posts in a query should be fetched while WP_Query is
going through it's various motions. They are saved to the object cache so
you won't find them in each $post, but once a post has been queried you can
fetch it's terms for free (no db queries, fast access to object cache).

I think that answers your question. Yes, you'll have to loop through all
taxonomies you are interested in to act on them, but it shouldn't be any
harder than looping through a $post->terms array, and avoids cluttering up
WP_Query objects with tons of metadata.

Nikola, thank you for your reply.
I think, it would be necessary to create a matrix.  and keep it handy...
sort of like...

the template tag   safe-in-HTML     safe-in-JS   safe-in-Attr
safe-in-Textarea        safe-in-HREF     etc...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the_title()             TRUE                FALSE      FALSE         FALSE
                   FALSE

This because WP_Image_Editor isn?t for that. It only does resizing and you have to do the storing yourself.
You could look into https://github.com/markoheijnen/WP_Image.

I guess that would be a good place to start. With suggestions what to use
in the context where it's not safe.

Well, if anyone does know of a way to do this, the assistance would be
appreciated.  I looked through some plugin code that works to replace the
image size 'file' field witha custom image name of the same size, and it
works for them. I just dont understand it.

You can use wp_get_attachment_metadata() and wp_update_attachment_metadata() for that.
Read the data, do the image manipulation and if it worked save the data.

Thanks Marko, My issue is my unset, and array_push isnt sticking.  I can
get the new array of information in the array, but when I run
wp_update_attachment_metadata()
with my new array, nothing updates. I think my understanding of how to work
with arrays is just not good enough.  Reading up on it though.

If you want to swap an image then unset and/or array_push. You can just find the location in the array and change the value.

Thank you for offering your help, believe me I appreciate it.  I got the
data updating, but this code seems really ineffecient.  However I owe you a
thanks, I took your advice on finding the location and just named it
directly.

$attachmentMetaData = wp_get_attachment_metadata($lastImage['id'], false);

$replaceWith = array (
  'file' => 'testing_array_replace.jpg',
  'width' => 500,
  'height' => 500,
  'mime-type' => 'image/jpeg'
);


if ($attachmentMetaData) {
    $attachmentMetaData['sizes']['User Crop']['file'] =
$replaceWith['file'];
    $attachmentMetaData['sizes']['User Crop']['width'] =
$replaceWith['width'];
    $attachmentMetaData['sizes']['User Crop']['height'] =
$replaceWith['height'];
    $attachmentMetaData['sizes']['User Crop']['mime-type'] =
$replaceWith['mime-type'];

   wp_update_attachment_metadata($firstImage['id'],$newArray );
}

Thinking about it, you never could have used array_push() due the fact that it is an associative array.
This would be the same and simpler.

$attachmentMetaData['sizes']['User Crop?] = $replaceWith;

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC2014's Idea
Message-ID: <CABu0MO+zyXDVH9Tg9VXaA6eGKfCf1ZwcwUL=zo4kXW_vcJKkMg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friend,
It is my pleasure to write here for you.I want to apply GsoC2014 and work
for GlotPress.

> GlotPress <http://trac.glotpress.org/> is a web-based collaborative
> translation tool. It is a web alternative to poEdit and the rest desktop
> gettext editing tools. Code-wise GlotPress is based on BackPress and a tiny
> MVC layer on top of it. The project will be to add functionality to
> GlotPress:
>
>    - fuzzy strings -- probably the most interesting part -- new strings
>    should be matched with old ones. If they are similar enough the old one
>    should be updated instead of inserting a new string.
>    - tags -- users should be able to tag strings in addition to some
>    machine tags (for example all strings in the admin panel should be tagged
>    wp-admin)
>    - comments for translations
>
> But I think it's a little difficult for me and I have other idea:
I think the plugin will make developers easlier translate themes and
plugins into other languages and make uesrs  use themes and plugins in
their languages easliy.The project will be to add functionality to
GlotPress:

   - Creating a language packs including the common words in Wordpress.
   - Introduced automatic translation.

Lots of themes and plugins only use English.It's difficult for
other-language novices,but it's also difficult and boring to translate them
into other languages for developers. I tried to use Poedit to translate a
theme,and excessive quantities and tedious process make me know how
difficult it is.In this process I found Google Translate can almost
correctly translate 50% at least,and others about 20% are common
professional words.
The plugins will prvoide new functions that is automatic translate,check
and change mistakes easliy of themes and plugins for developers and users.
Please forgive my mistakes in this email,because I'm a Chinese and bad at
English.^_^
Thank you and look forward to your feedbacks and suggestions.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Pagination & Custom Table (not posts)
Message-ID: <1392750012133-43372.post@n5.nabble.com>

I am almost done with my first plugin, largely thanks to the help I have
received here (*Nikola* & *JD* specifically). One of the last things I want
to implement is pagination.  I read about  query_posts
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts>  , and I see
that if you are working with a custom post type, really anything thats
within wordpress by default- you can paginate that automatically using the
'paged' parameter.  

Is it possible to also use the built into pagination on table data that is
not a post?  I assume this is a NO, and if I am right- how would a person go
about implementing paged results for a custom table?   The obvious route in
my mind is to register the query_var 'page', query $wpdb with a pageLimit
and all that.  

But, Maybe its possible wordpress offers a solution for this so a person
wont need to do all that?

Hi,

I am Kshitij Prasad, a fourth year undergraduate in Computer Science
student from IIIT Hyderabad, India. I came across Wordpress through the
GSoC 2013 project list. I am quite interested in php development. I would
love to work for this organization during this summer as a part of GSoC. I
have a proficient knowledge of PHP and JavaScript.

I have downloaded the code and integrated it with Netbeans. I am also
currently going through the documentation available on the website. I have
read the codebase documentation and have some basic knowledge of the
workflow of the code. I am interested in the plugin development. I have
read the documentation regarding plugin development.

This is the first time I am working with Open Source development and it'd
be really helpful if a mentor could guide me through the process of
contributing to the organization. Also, if someone from the community has
some useful links/resources for new comers, that'd be great!

Thanks,
Kshitij Prasad

Can anyone point me to where the data returned by this function is cached?

It is continuing to include a blog that was deleted days ago, I'm having to
check against get_blog_details() in order to stop SQL errors trying to look
up against tables that don't exist.

Thanks!

The wp_get_sites function isn't cached. It selects the data directly from
the database. You can see the code yourself at the bottom of
wp-includes/ms-functions.php.

If you want it to not return deleted sites, you need to pass it deleted=0
as an argument.

Hi Tom,

the function cache via wp_cache_set(), but the expire is 0.
Maybe you have a other function, there change this expire value?

It's not that it is set to be deleted, it is that the row in the database
has been deleted and the tables dropped (probably via the 'delete site'
network admin menu, but it's a dev environment with other developers).

I've not had time to look into something re-createable, but to illustrate
my point, this would be the pseudo-code steps to replicate the issue (the
aim being here to explain that there is no row in wp_blogs to match the
blogid that the function returns).

1. Set up WP Network
2. Create 2 new blogs (you now have blog IDs 1,2,3)
3. DELETE from wp_blogs WHERE blog_id=2
4. DROP tables like 'wp_2%'
5. $sites = wp_get_sites();

At this point, assuming the issue is that simple, $sites=array( 1, 2, 3 ),
even though blog 2 has been deleted.

That's why I assumed that the SQL cached somewhere.

I'll add a little context here, for any googling:
This is the code:
function tcb_find_blogs_to_archive(){
  $blogs   = wp_get_sites();
  $archive = array();
  foreach( $blogs as $blogid => $blog ){
    $state = get_blog_option( $blogid, 'my_blog_state', 'live' );
    if( $state == 'archive' ){
      $archive[$blogid] = $blog;
    }
  }

  return $archive;
}

Generates this error:
WordPress database error Table 'testdb.wp_4_options' doesn't exist for
query SELECT option_value FROM wp_4_options WHERE option_name =
'my_blog_state' LIMIT 1 made by require_once('wp-admin/admin.php')...

I don't understand how the 'deleted' argument would make any difference in
this case (unless it is being cached somewhere)?

Or am I just not grokking this? ;p

If the database has been manually altered, and you're running an object
cache.. the simplest solution is to just reload your object cache (ie.
reload php-fpm, clear memcache, clear apc, whatever) and let WordPress fill
the caches back up.

If it's a development platform that shouldn't be an issue - and tell the
other developers not to alter raw data while there's caching involved next
time..

There are no cache defines in wp-config.php

Neither memcache, nor apc are installed on the host.

I used the example of deleting table rows to emphasize that there is no row
(with 'deleted'=1) in the database.

So, I can see no reason why anything other than WordPress is caching the
existence of the blog.

Well, if there's no caches defined, then it's not a WordPress caching issue
:)

Looking at wp_get_sites(), there is indeed no caching at all (as Otto
rightly pointed out), so even if WordPress DID have caching enabled it
wouldn't do anything.

So you've got a fault in either:
a) MySQL returning the wrong data - or caching the return (unlikely)
or
b) Something loaded in WordPress which is caching the query.
WordPress doesn't have query caching, so that points to a plugin or custom
DB dropin. W3 Total cache comes to mind as one plugin which does do query
caching.

No caching plugins active to my knowledge.

This is the list of all directories in /plugins/

all-in-one-seo-pack
broken-site-checker
debug-bar
debug-bar-extender
force-strong-passwords
gplus-comments
image-widget
limit-login-attempts
mce-table-buttons
media-links
meta-box
multiple-post-thumbnails
option-tree
plugin-toggle
posts-to-posts
redirection
regenerate-thumbnails
social-media-icons
user-switching
wordpress-importer
gravityforms
my-blog-management

Not all are in use. There are no mu-plugins. The bottom one is the plugin
calling wp_get_sites() (I grepped /wp-content/).

Anyway, I see that I have hit some edge case of my own making. Thanks for
trying to help. I'll be quiet now.

Hopefully I'll get the time to either move off the edge, or make it
re-creatable and submit as a bug (be that core, plugin or theme).

Hello list,

We write and publish light-touch inspections of WordPress plugins that 
we do for our clients. They are just a guide - we conduct some basic 
checks, not a thorough review.

Would plugins which fail this inspection be of general interest to the 
list and therefore worth posting? Is the list also interested in 
vulnerability advisories, or do people tend to get those elsewhere?

Here's an example report:

https://security.dxw.com/plugins/pods-custom-content-types-and-fields/

Grateful for a steer...

Harry

Harry-

I am the community manager for Pods we were made aware of your evaluation
by a user who reported it in our GitHub issue tracker. Our leader
developer, Scott K. Clark, has responded to your claims, which we do not
consider to be fair, here:

https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/2043#issuecomment-35538379

I would encourage you to contact the developers of plugins before releasing
vulnerability reports. This sort of vague report doesn't help us improve
our plugin, something we are constantly doing based on input from users. It
only serves to potentially confuse users.

Take care,
Josh Pollock

I certainly can't speak for others, but I would venture to say that your
business model is evil at best.  You do fly-by character assassination
(oops, I mean "light-touch inspections"), based on personal bias ("this
plugin is large"), and then broadly publish the results as if they are
somehow authoritative.  Worse yet, you then hold plugin developers at
ransom for changing the review: "If you would like to commission us to
inspect or review the latest version, please contact us."

How this is of value to anyone, and how you sleep at night with this
specious business model, is completely beyond me.

I had the exact opposite reaction to Chris Williams. Literally a week 
ago I was talking to someone about the need for more rigorous evaluation 
of plugins. I find that I now use only a small handful of plugins that I 
have extensive experience with because of the lack of any quality 
standard.

If that sounds a bit harsh, I'd suggest enabling DEBUG and mysql slow 
query (at something like 1 second) and then test out various plugins. 
And that's just the blatantly obvious stuff. I won't point fingers, but 
I recently had issues with one pretty popular plugin and when I went 
into the code to poke around I found that it is fundamentally flawed in 
the design -- so much so that I rewrote it and will be sending the 
author the new code and explanation.

I understand that a cursory review is subjective and prone to 
misstatements, but it's at least a step in the right direction. Perhaps 
the next step would be for Harry to formalize some kind of process for 
responding to / contesting reviews and to encourage community 
involvement (maybe via this list) to "review the reviews" if you will. 
I'd be happy to get involved in a process like that if the end result 
were a base of plugins that had been scrutinized by some of the WP 
brains on this list.

And if, at the end of the day, he harnesses that power to help build a 
business, I don't see anything wrong with that either. I think 99% of us 
are using WP to make money and it seems to me like he's identified a 
clear need and at least attempted to address it -- which is pretty much 
the story of every successful business.

I find the example "light-touch" (what does that mean?) inspection to be of
very little value at all. Phrases like "very likely to have", "contains or
is likely to contain", and "probably contains" mean nothing when it comes
to security: is it, or isn't it? More complete reviews with definitive
statements and examples would be of much more interest to myself.

Jamie-

The ability to easily do an independent security review of open source
software, is one of the strengths of the open source model. But publishing
vague results, and not contacting the developer, and/ or
security at wordpress.org, with any concrete details of a threat doesn't help
the developer, the community or the users. If anyone can identify a
specific security threat in Pods, please email Scott at pods.io and we will
address it, like any other responsible developer would.

Take care,
Josh

- Who elected DXW as the keeper of the standards?
- How does DXW establish their standards ("this plugin is large")?
- Can anyone have input into those standards?
- What value is there in a "cursory review"?  If you don't understand the
code, you don't have a leg to stand on.
- What recourse other than paying them is there to a bad review?
- If an author takes their input and fixes their plugin, will DXW redo the
review without payment, and then repair all the negative publicity they
have generated?
- If I use a plugin that DXW has reviewed as safe, and I get hacked, can I
sue DXW?
- How does one insure that DXW doesn't have ulterior motives in their
reviews?  Competitive products, products they don't like/use, authors who
pay for reviews being treated better than authors who don't?

This is just like Yelp -- a half-baked idea made even worse by little or
no validation of the source of the review.

Hi Josh,

Thanks for the heads-up. I've had a quick look at the github issue - 
I'll reply to that feedback there.

Regarding a private report - this isn't a vulnerability report. We do 
those too (see the Advisories section) and we have a disclosure policy 
for those which you can see here (https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/).

Inspections are a very light touch thing, and we don't think they go 
into enough detail to be able to make categorical claims about 
vulnerability. The idea behind an inspection is to give a general sense 
of the sorts of issues which might exist. I'm about to reply to Chris's 
post with more explanation on that point.

Harry

BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO!  Your website has a bold red mark that
says "Unsafe for use" on many plugins!

For me, the incongruity happens when a "light touch review" leads to an
"Unsafe To Use" conclusion. I don't see how you can justify such a
conclusion without actually evaluating the code.

The security email is for WP core security.

Plugin security issues should go to plugins at wordpress.org

I totally understand the particular criticisms being made here, and 
agree 100% that if you're going to put out a review it should be 
thorough, transparent, have an ability for redress, etc.

Still, I think the basic concept has merit. Right now plugins are a bit 
like Russian Roulette -- install one, cross fingers, see what happens to 
site. And for those who don't program or have limited knowledge you're 
really taking a chance because you truly have to trust that what you're 
installing isn't introducing vulnerabilities that you'd have no way of 
discovering or remedying.

If I put out a plugin I'd love to have people on this list tear it apart 
so that I can improve it. And I'd love to see some sort of a good 
housekeeping seal for plugins that have undergone a more rigorous 
evaluation.

I haven't released any of my plugins publicly thus far -- they've all 
been for private client projects -- but I do have a handful I hope to 
put out this year. But as it stands, I have no skin in this game, just 
chipping in my opinion.

Hi Chris,

I'm sorry you feel that way, and I can say categorically that we are not 
trying to hold anyone to ransom. I'll try to explain.

Going back a couple of years, our clients expected us to give them some 
sort of assessment of plugins before we suggested using them. For a 
while, we did this informally, and the results were very mixed. We found 
that sometimes we would miss things. There was no set of criteria that 
we applied, and we didn't record the results. This also led us to waste 
time by checking out the same problem twice.

To solve these problems, we decided have a list of things that we think 
are important (https://security.dxw.com/about/plugin-inspections/) and 
to record the results of inspections somewhere so we didn't duplicate 
work. We did this in private for a while but then thought that this was 
probably information that others might find useful. So, we decided to 
publish the results.

We have tried very hard to make sure that the results of these 
inspections, and our confidence in them, is obvious to people who read 
them. We've published the process. We've made sure it's clear that 
inspections deal with likelihoods, not certainties. We've said that 
people should always conduct their own checks. We've set out our terms 
of service prominently, which include contact information for anyone 
who'd like to tell us we're wrong. And we're totally happy (within 
reason) to revisit things if people do that.

I would very much like it if these inspections could be more thorough, 
but unfortunately, we're subject to the same commercial realities as 
everyone else. We care more about security than most of our clients. 
Most people are not willing to pay for security assurance work. 
Inspections are light-touch because we don't charge existing clients for 
them, and that's the only way we can make it economical.

I hope we can figure out some way to make some money out of this (hence 
those messages saying we can be commissioned) but so far, we haven't 
made a penny. We're just trying to make the outputs of something we do 
anyway useful to a wider group.

If you have feedback on practical ways we could do that better, I'd love 
to hear it.

Harry

Hi Chris, Chip,

We do evaluate the code. An inspection usually takes about an hour, and 
we review the code for the things listed.

I can appreciate the point you're making here, but we do need that 
process to result in some conclusion that we can use to decide what to 
do. And as far as we're concerned, plugins which are littered with XSS 
and don't prepare their queries are, in fact, unsafe to use.

That said, we have tried our best to make it clear what that means. The 
red box links to the explanation of the process, which states:
> This plugin should not be used unless very careful consideration is 
> given to the vulnerabilities it probably contains and ways to mitigate 
> them.
Which, I think, is generally good advice.

Harry

You are filled with double-speak.  You say you don't want to make
categorical claims about people's code, but that's exactly what you do.
You say you don't want to hold people ransom, but then below admit that's
precisely what you are trying to do to make a business out of it.  You say
your inspections aren't worth the bits it takes to express them, but then
highlight the results in red, with vague caveats to try to hedge your bets.

Here's my advice:  Keep your opinions to yourself (and maybe your clients).

Unless and until you provide a clear/clean/transparent method for
evaluation, that isn't subject to the many issues I raised in my other
note, that has well-defined and very public methods for redress, and that
doesn't result in random and spurious claims about code you've barely even
bothered to understand, keep mum.  As your grandmother said "if you can't
say anything nice, don't say anything at all."

Want to see how ugly this can get?  Enable comments on your reviews, and
sit back and watch.  You'll get plugin developers passionately trying to
defend themselves.  You'll get their competitors jumping in to throw mud.
You'll get fanboys and haters jumping all over each other.  It will get so
ugly so fast...

I appreciate that you feel there is some value to you and your clients in
this work.  But please, don't try to be the "Good Housekeeping" seal of
approval without a whole lot more thought into it than you've clearly done
so far...

Hi Chris,

I think you raise some good points.

I'm going to change the commissioning bit. I agree that it is prone to 
misinterpretation.

I think there's no way to do this without some caveating, and I think it 
is useful notwithstanding the caveats. But I agree that they're perhaps 
not clear enough, and that "unsafe for use" might be a little too 
categorical. I've had a couple of emails privately from developers this 
evening which do make it pretty plain that the current approach is 
confusing people.

We have published a clear and transparent set of criteria, and those are 
what we apply. We have done our best to make this as clear as possible.

We are doing our best to do something useful, and I strongly believe 
that this site goes some way to filling an important gap. On this we may 
perhaps have to agree to disagree. But I do value the points you've made 
and we will make some changes based upon then. I'd be keen to hear any 
other feedback you might have later (short of "stop doing it"!)

Harry

I love these rules for failing a plugin:

Poor coding style
Exhibits the characteristics of poor coding style, including (but not limited to):
    Lack of indenting
    Inconsistent indenting
    Lack of clear commenting where it would be appropriate; ie, to
    explain complex functionality or dense code

The lack of good style must materially reduce the tester's ability to
understand what the code is doing, thereby indicating that the lack of
good style has reduced code readability and maintainability.

Does the end user really care how the code is written?
The grade depends on the expertise of the testers. What makes them
qualified to give this grade? Do they have a PHP certification, what's
their background?

Let's hear! What ARE the quals of these "testers?" That's a reasonable request.?


Also, style is only dictated by the individual or org that's producing the plugin, and not to be defined generally by other than IEEE or ISO for example.?




The critique might be interesting for other coders to read, but must be published//presented in an anonymous fashion and with the owners permission noting that it is a fair critique.?

This isn't about aesthetics - code that is written in such a way that it 
is very difficult to follow is also harder to maintain. It's more likely 
to contain bugs, some of which may be vulnerabilities. And it's much 
easier to make mistakes when editing it after you haven't looked at it 
for a while. It's also evidence that the developer may be inexperienced. 
These are all important factors. That said, I can't imagine that a 
plugin would fail an inspection on this criterion alone.

The inspections are carried out by experienced developers. I can 
appreciate that that might not be clear at the moment. I'm not sure how 
we'd go about reassuring people on that front, though: what would you 
consider to be good evidence that we're knowledgeable?

Hi Eric, Madalin,

That seems reasonable. For the moment - since this is not a service that 
makes us any money at all - I think that it's probably not a practical 
option. But I will keep it in mind.

You might perhaps draw some comfort from the advisories section. All of 
these specific vulnerabilities have been identified by the same testers 
that carry out inspections, have been responsibly disclosed and fixed by 
the relevant developers.

Harry

Hi Harry,

I agree with your idea with the reviews on dxw.com, but as Eric mentioned,
you need some certifications to become an authority and trusted in this.

If not, this will just cause just a dispute and fight on each side.

My personal opinion, I would not trust 100% your reviews as you "green"
some plugins I'd run away from and "red/yellow" a few that really need a
more relevant review, but you have some good points on a few "red" labeled.

Mentioning here on almost all your responses about this service doesn't
makes you money it's pointless, you should be proud that you want to
contribute to the WordPress community and stop complaining about money. If
you want only money, then I suggest you review more on "premium" stuff, as
WordPress.org has a team of members that do reviews and
approve/disapproving plugins and themes and in WordPress.org case we should
have a really nice chat about how we can improve this service so plugins
and themes that would not respect all standards we vote for should be
excluded until corrected as should.

That's the basic idea, yeah. It would actually be a custom post rather

Yeah, that's all correct. There'll also be some features specific to 
WordCamp.org, like supporting pre-defined base forms that organizers can 
customize. For instance, a "Call for Speakers" form that potential 
WordCamp speakers can fill out. It would have some standard fields like 
Name, E-mail Address, WordPress.org username, etc, but then the 
organizers could also add their custom questions to the form.

Another feature we're thinking about is having the results of certain 
forms automatically populate some of our other custom post types. For 
example, when someone fills out the Call for Speakers form, it could 
automatically create a drafted Speaker post, so that the organizers 
don't have to copy/paste the data between the two.

Good. That's exactly how it's supposed to work!

Sorry if I've come across as complaining. I'm not, at all. We are doing 
this in order to contribute to the community - if we didn't care, we 
wouldn't have bothered. I hope the site may make some money one day but 
that is not it's main motivation.

I'm all for that. I think there's room for both! And up for a nice chat 
any time :)

Hi Harry

I think there is potentially a very useful idea and service here, but I
really think a lot more care, depth, clarity (and possibly right to reply
for plugin authors) needs to go into the reviews.

Here's an example that really stands out to me:
https://security.dxw.com/plugins/relevanssi-premium


"This plugin also has a history of broken releases, including one which
> contained malicious code added to the distribution after the author's
> website was hacked in July 2013."



I was the person who discovered that Mikko's website had been hacked and
the resulting attempted malicious code that was inserted into his plugin (I
say attempted, because due to a typo by the hacker it didn't actually do
anything). I reported it responsibly by emailing him privately at 11.30pm
on a Friday night. By the Monday he had fixed it, released a new version,
installed additional security measures on his server and emailed all his
users to openly explain and apologise for what had happened, which is
pretty much a textbook exemplary way to deal with this sort of thing.

It seems unfair therefore that you have turned something that happened
seven months ago that was resolved so speedily and responsibly into a very
public black mark against this plugin, especially in a format that doesn't
give the author any right to reply.


"We have sampled a quite a few of these queries and none appear to be
> injectable, but we suspect this is more likely to be due to luck than good
> judgement."



What you're saying here is you conducted an incomplete test, couldn't find
anything wrong, yet you then decided that this must be luck, so you're
going to count it against the plugin anyway?! The word 'suspect' really
shouldn't have any place in a professional and public vulnerability review
- either you test fully and find a vulnerability (which you then report in
the proper manner to the author) or you don't.

You've then failed the plugin on three code-related criteria, but then
state in the box on the right that you haven't actually done a proper code
inspection.

Finally, it's very unclear to me who the reviews are aimed at? If it's for
non-teccie end users, then they are very unlikely to understand concepts
such as "unprepared SQL statements", but as a developer, an incomplete high
level review that hasn't delved comprehensively into the code is no use to
me at all.

All the best
Simon

Hi all


I'm looking for something like 
http://snipplr.com/view/8121/html-test-page-for-css-style-guide but I'm 
thinking it should have ongoing life and development (probably on 
Github), unlike random snippets off pastebins.

Elementary GH searches didn't really turn up anything meaningful, so 
before I waste a few hours, maybe I'll just ask here if anyone knows any 
such repos?

Idea is to stick such a style guide page into my every WP project to 
test the stylesheet for basic typography and themsuch.

Wouldn't be the Them Unit Testing good for this, or for more wptest.io?

I'm using them for all WordPress themes I do for my clients and since

A few tings:
"Harder to maintain", for the tester maybe, but for the developer it
might make sense, but even if that is not the case, so what. If the
plugin works as advertised, and is being compatible with the latest
WordPress version, why would it be downgraded?

"More likely to contain bugs". More likely? So now we are presuming
that it contains bugs? The first lesson I was taught during my coding
lessons "Don't assume anything!"

"editing it after you haven't looked at it for a while" - Uhmm, I
thought the rating was for end-users not the maintainer of the plugin,

"I can't imagine that a plugin would fail an inspection on this
criterion alone." Coding style is all very subjective to start with,
you can't give a grade to subjectivity. Now if you said the coding
style has to conform to WordPress, okay but still not a valid case to
downgrade a plugin.
What are your criteria for coding style, Cyclomatic complexity, Design
Structure Quality Index, Halstead complexity measures? Does every
tester follow the same criteria? Where can one find your criteria?

"what would you consider to be good evidence that we're knowledgeable"
Like people already stated: Certification is one, but I personally
don't care if somebody is certified, I rather look at their
track records, in other words, what have these testers written
themselves.
If Mark Jaquith, Nacin, Taylor Otwell or Fabien Potencier would tell me
how to improve my code I would be more likely to listen then if is was
some schmuck who hasn't written any significant PHP program with every
PHP certification in the world :)

Let's see if I can summarize: you are using arbitrary criteria
administered by people of unknown skill/experience and using the results
to publicly condemn other people's work with an overly broad brush, and
without any mechanism for recourse.  The result has no positive benefits.
It demeans the plugin authors and their work, and by reflection your firm
and its work, raises alarm in the community you claim to support, and
garners you no goodwill.

I'm sorry, but given the train wreck this has become, my best advice is
precisely that: stop doing it.

Harry,

It seems you've created quite the stir, so let me try and put it in
perspective for you.
If someone walked into your building and started tearing out wall sockets
and checking your electrical wiring then walked up to you and handed you a
sheet of paper saying you failed an electrical inspection, wouldn't you
want to know this person is a qualified electrician?

I agree that we do need something like this, transparent reviews on such
things. However if it isn't making you money, then maybe for now the best
thing to do would be to actually not do these reviews as you lose money on
them. I realise you said that you don't want that kind of advice but it is
what I will give.

I had a quick look at your review of the PODS plugin, as any user would,
without going too far in depth and it looked like a dangerous plugin from
your review. Then I had a look at the github response, and thought "Maybe
it's not that bad". Without having done my own review I can not be certain
any more, is this the kind of response you want? Uncertainty? Who should I
trust? Why should I trust you over the plugin developer? It comes back to
qualifications.

Also, my understanding is you submit such reviews without letting anyone
know. If you wish to improve your current system, you should have some
method of contacting the plugin developers to at least let them know of the
review. If someone was secretly going around telling people not to do
business with you because you don't use recycled plastic in your printers
(or something equally as ridiculous), you'd want to know, surely.

As for your point of requiring payment for a review... Most WordPress
plugins are released open source. As such, the developer makes no money off
it. They invest their time in it for no gains, to find someone has
published a "light-touch" review saying it is dangerous. They will have to
spend their own money, after giving up their own time to have this
re-reviewed (if that's even a word), in the hopes they will have a better
review.

Also, what are you doing to ensure the reviews are not biased to your
programmer? It's very easy to be biased in any circumstance, even in your
profession. When I was in school, my Computer Science teacher did this one
thing to ensure that he was not being biased - instead of writing our names
on our tests, we would write our birth-date. Essentially it came back that
he was not being biased, which is great. But what are you and your
organisation doing to ensure there's no bias in these reviews? Google does
something with their code where it must be submitted for review, and
reviewed by 2 people before it is committed to the code-base. Maybe
something similar could work for you?

Having said all that... If you could address all these issues and make your
reviews transparent, as others have said, and fix these few other issues,
this could be quite a handy resource. However if you are unable to fix this
due to it not being commercially viable to do so, it might be best to
"suspend" the service until such time you can afford to fix it.

If your car is not road-worthy, do you keep driving it until you can afford
to fix it? No, because it is dangerous to do so. So why would you do it
with a service like this?

My advice would be:
1. Set up a standard for these reviews. It needs to be open to criticism.
2. Make it clear that such reviews are simply advisory and are not to be
taken as anything otherwise.
3. Your guys need some credibility. Someone said third-party
certification...
4. There needs to be a way for developers to get back to you, and you
should contact the developers to let them know of the review.
5. Your reviews also should be open to comments, perhaps others could share
their opinions. This would obviously have to be moderated (refer to Chris's
comment on mud fights).
6. You also need to ensure the reviews are not biased.

I realise that doing something out of your own pocket is hard, and quite
respectable when it is for the benefit of others. However unless these can
be fixed you might actually be doing the opposite of what you intend.

Best Regards.

Hey everyone,

Can we please keep the list reasonably civil? There's no need to use a 
tonne of exclamation points and upper case to make your points, not to 
resort to name-calling and personal attacks.

Harry is publishing internal reviews that presumably DXW is doing 
regardless, and thought this might be useful for everyone else. He 
didn't claim to be the singular authority on this, but merely that these 
reviews might be useful for others.

Thanks,
Ryan.

Harry,

Criticism is hard to take, but important for improvement.

Now that I?ve learned of your reviews, I?m anxious to find out if your team has reviewed any of my plugins, and what issues that might have uncovered.

Because I?m not the only one who has to read my code, and pull requests or patches make my day, I know I how important it is to make my code easy to read and use consistent style.

I have no idea who the reviewers are, or what their skills might be, but it?s probably fair that code that might be questionable to them is worth looking at on my part. If I?ve got a really good reason to do something that raises flags for others, then that?s a really good reason to put comments in the code explaining it. That?s especially true for security and performance issues.

Two requests:

* Consider filing bugs. Just a generic bug with a link to the review so I?d be aware of it would be great. Most of my plugins are in Github, https://github.com/misterbisson?tab=repositories (the others are sort of abandoned by now).

* If I update my plugin to address the issues, are you willing to review the updates in a reasonable time and update the public review?

Thank you,

?Casey

New topic to spice things up.

One of my dedicated servers recently starting giving me problems with 
GIT. I'd ssh in to pull the latest version of a plugin and would get 
error messages about the resource being unavailable or whatever. Tracked 
it down to too many processes running, specifically calls to 
admin-ajax.php.

Googling turns up lots of threads on the topic, but none that has really 
helped nail down exactly what's going on. If I select one of the 
processes hitting admin-ajax and kill it, they all disappear and 
everything goes back to working.

It seems that auto-save could be the culprit, though I've changed the 
auto-save time period to much longer than stock. I have a sneaking 
suspicion that it's a theme that was just installed on a site (multisite 
network) which has its own page builder framework.

So, anyone have a suggestion as to how I might track down where the 
request to admin-ajax is originating? grep gives me the list of 
potential candidates, but that would only help if I were to start 
disabling / enabling things and then watching to see what happens -- not 
an option on a live network of sites.

Disappointingly, we'll perhaps have to agree to disagree.

I think the site is a positive contribution to WordPress's security. 
Hopefully, in time, we'll earn some trust. I'm not expecting that to be 
instant. I don't think we're condemning anybody: we're pointing out 
issues which are widely accepted to be indicative of problematic code.

In the mean time, people are - of course - free to vote with their feet 
and not visit the site. Or set up a better one.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for your reply and the kind words.

I would love to be able to make these reviews more thorough, but we're 
subject to the same commercial realities as any other company: our 
clients want these reviews, and don't want to pay for them. So we're 
doing our best to make them as good as we can, within the resources we 
have. I'm definitely open to ways we can make them better and have 
already made some changes to these pages based on the feedback in this 
thread.

I've had a read of the Relevanssi one, and I agree that it's not quite 
right at the moment. It's kinda judgemental and the server hack thing 
doesn't have enough context. It's got Glyn as the author but I'm pretty 
sure I rewrote that one, so it's my bad. We're still quite early on in 
the process and we will get better.

I've edited those findings to make them a bit more objective. Here's the 
original one, QFT:

> generation. This plugin contains a large number of long and 
> complicated SQL queries and there is no organised or methodical

I do stand by the rating, though. This plugin has not "failed" (there 
isn't really any such outcome). It's assessment is "use with caution" 
and I think that is right.

That the author does appear to be safely escaping queries without 
preparing them saves it from being rated "potentially unsafe", and the 
lack of systematic SQL preparation is an issue. This plugin is more 
likely than something systematic to have a dangerous query someone has 
overlooked, or to introduce one in the future. And that likelihood is 
made more significant by the very complex query generation in functions 
like relevanssi_search in search.php, where the generation of one query 
is spread over 100+ of lines of code.

The reviews are aimed at anyone running a WordPress website. We've tried 
to strike a balance between adding enough technical detail to the 
findings for developers and security people to follow them up, and 
having a clear recommendation, so that non-technical users gain some 
benefit as well.

Hi Peter,

I share your view that certification is of limited value :)

However, I don't think I'm going to get into a debate on this one. I 
think it's pretty obvious that spaghetti code is more likely to be bad, 
and this is all that criterion means. So I think I'll leave it at that.

Harry

Thanks Ryan! And spot on.

I hope people find these reviews useful, but if not - of course - they 
should simply not use them.

Hi Casey,

Thanks for the feedback and questions.

Really good point about the comments - inspections are a manual process 
and I would hope we would notice any comments like that and take them 
into account. We haven't spotted many yet though! Generally the comments 
are along the lines of "// TODO: I know this is bad but I'll fix it 
later" :)

On those requests:

Filing bugs is something we'd love to be able to do, but I just don't 
think it's practical for us. An inspection is a very time-limited thing 
and it doesn't usually result in enough information for a good bug 
report. If we find something that's definitely vulnerable, we do 
generally write an advisory and report that, either directly or via 
plugins at wordpress.org. We would also like to be able to notify plugin 
authors, but for it to be practical, it would have to be automatic. We 
can't automatically email authors as WordPress.org (entirely reasonably) 
does not publicise author email addresses. I suppose we could put a 
robot post on the plugin forum, but that seems... questionable. What do 
you think?

Of course, we do want to keep everything as up to date as we can. 
Unfortunately we don't have nearly the time to be able to monitor all 
the inspections for updated versions and check them again proactively. 
Inspections will get update if a client asks us to review an updated 
version. We do currently always do an updated inspection if the author 
drops us a note to ask for one, but that is a bit dependent on our 
availability - I can't guarantee we'll always be able to. But certainly 
for now, if you have a new version, send an email to contact at dxw.com 
with the details, and we'll have a look.

Cheers,

Harry

We do for advisories - which identify specific vulnerabilities - but not for inspections, ?which more generic. It wouldn't really be practical for us to do it for inspections.

This has come up elsewhere in the thread, ?though - and we've pondered automatic notifications going to the plugin's forum. What do you think?

Listen I don't disagree that spaghetti code is bad, I just understand
the reasoning that this would downgrade a plugin for it's usage.

What you are saying is that you would consider to downgrade a safety
test of a car because the car is dirty, and well that means it's likely
to have bad welding but if it's all shiny it's fine.

You can't say code is bad without giving reasons why. How can you
expect a developer to improve his grade if you don't tell him what's
wrong.

You don't even let developers know you are testing their plugin.

You created this business model and it seems you forgot a few things
in the model. It's clear you underestimated the shockwave it would send
through the community.

You can't sue them Chris, no mater how they reviewed the code.

Rule 3 in their Terms of Service
"Accordingly, we make absolutely no guarantees. If we are wrong in our
assessment you accept that you are not able to sue us for that reason."

On an updated review:
Rule 4
"If you object to any of our assessments, for example if you are a
maintainer on a project about which we?ve published some information,
please contact us at contact at dxw.com giving full particulars of your
objection and we will try to consider your objections within a
reasonable time. We do not guarantee to change or remove anything
merely on request." and in another email Harry wrote:

"Of course, we do want to keep everything as up to date as we can.
Unfortunately we don't have nearly the time to be able to monitor all
the inspections for updated versions and check them again proactively.
Inspections will get update if a client asks us to review an updated
version. We do currently always do an updated inspection if the author
drops us a note to ask for one, but that is a bit dependent on our
availability - I can't guarantee we'll always be able to. But certainly
for now, if you have a new version, send an email to contact at dxw.com
with the details, and we'll have a look."

So what is it? It can't be "always" if you can't "guarantee you'll
always be able to"

 purpose of markup only?
Message-ID: <CAFaCOgziC7gQcZ30Pw_8TnwnH+6tXr1X_=kBUQk4nS=uqY_XLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'd like to create a language pack, en_IN i.e., Indian English, based on
the default WordPress language (en_US). All I need is the markup `en-IN` or
`en_IN` instead of the defaults (`en-US` or `en_US`) where appropriate.

For e.g.

   <html lang="en-IN">

Instead of:

   <html lang="en-US">

And, another instance:

   <meta property="og:locale" content="en_IN">

instead of:

   <meta property="og:locale" content="en_US">

So, what'd be the simplest way to create a language pack so that it has the
same translation string definitions as en_US, but outputs the right
language attribute values (`en-IN` or `en_IN` depending on the attribute)?

Thanks!

The community would be better served if you first contacted plugin authors
and the maintainers of the WP plugin repo regarding security issues.

If the door on your neighbor's shed was broken, making it easy for thieves
to enter, would you first announce it to the whole community in a letter to
the editor alongside an ad for your door repair services, or would you be
Dudley Do-Right and tell your neighbor directly?

If you've reviewed enough code to make the claims, you can certainly reveal
specific vulnerabilities to the plugin authors and allow them to fix them.
This is pretty much the way any open source community handles security
issues. If you do enough of that, the money will come - if that's what you
want.

After a reasonable period of time after security updates have been released
(or not in cases where plugin authors are unresponsive), the public service
announcement could follow.

As an example of an interesting way to handle crowd-sourcing security
reviews, check out what Github does with their Bug Bounty program:
https://bounty.github.com/

Basically, interested parties look for errors, report them to Github when
found, and get public credit and applause for finding the problem (and the
opportunity to disclose what they found) after it's been fixed.

Hi John,

This - more or less - is exactly how we operate.

We have a look. If we see indications of badness, but no specific 
vulnerabilities, we write that up and publish the inspection.

If we see vulnerabilities, we write up an advisory and disclose it 
responsibly, exactly as you suggest (details: 
https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/).

I don't think it is necessary to disclose in advance for an inspection, 
because we're not announcing that the neighbour's shed is broken. We're 
announcing that neighbour's shed's looking a bit old and tatty, and that 
people might not want to keep their stuff in it until it's fixed.

Quite a few people have suggested that we should reach out to plugin 
authors, though. I am, in principle, happy to do that. But such a 
mechanism would have to be at least partly automated, and we have no 
private contact details for plugin authors. So, the best we could do is 
probably to have a bot that posts on people's forums. But that's more 
notification than notice, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the idea 
of such a bot in any event.

If you have an idea for how we can reliably, semi-automatically give 
authors notice, and then publish after some predefined time - I'm all ears.

Harry

So basically, it sounds to me like after spending "much time" on a
(still unproven to be) comprehensive review, you can't simply Google
the name of the author, look their email up on their GitHub repo, or
plug their name into Twitter.

 It seems your entire business is based on providing mediocre (at
best) subpar reviews, which are then published to the public to
encourage users to not use what very likely could be a perfectly fine
plugin (since the highly subjective criteria of the review doesn't
even sound, by your own account that comprehensive), and then not
alert the author before publishing. Then, when said author finds out,
they in essence have to purchase your service to get their plugin
re-reviewed since, by your own account while you'll review it for
free, you may or may not have the time, and a plugin author doesn't
want false reviews online for long. And since said reviews are done by
employees of unknown skill, the outcome of said review could just as
easily be determined by rolling a dice.

 So basically an author has to pay to remove what could very likely be
slander from the internet.
 It very well seems your entire business model boils down to
monetizing the practice of slander, correct?

 Here is, based on your own account, what such a report could be:
 Avoid at all costs security.dxw.com, it is ABSOLUTELY RIDDLED WITH
MALWARE (imagine that in a giant red banner). See, we didn't really
actually review the code of said site that well, or even at all. It
was done by someone who is still learning HTML, and while we didn't
really review it, there's a possibility it contains malware, even
though we haven't proven it to exist yet. Therefore, our firm
recommendation is to avoid said site at all costs until said author
pays me $1,000,000 to re-review his site.

Hi John,

 This - more or less - is exactly how we operate.

 We have a look. If we see indications of badness, but no specific
 vulnerabilities, we write that up and publish the inspection.

 If we see vulnerabilities, we write up an advisory and disclose it
 responsibly, exactly as you suggest (details:
 https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/).

 I don't think it is necessary to disclose in advance for an
inspection,
 because we're not announcing that the neighbour's shed is broken.
We're
 announcing that neighbour's shed's looking a bit old and tatty, and
that
 people might not want to keep their stuff in it until it's fixed.

 Quite a few people have suggested that we should reach out to plugin
 authors, though. I am, in principle, happy to do that. But such a
 mechanism would have to be at least partly automated, and we have no
 private contact details for plugin authors. So, the best we could do
is
 probably to have a bot that posts on people's forums. But that's more
 notification than notice, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the
idea
 of such a bot in any event.

 If you have an idea for how we can reliably, semi-automatically give
 authors notice, and then publish after some predefined time - I'm all
ears.

As an example of an interesting way to handle crowd-sourcing security
 reviews, check out what Github does with their Bug Bounty program:
 https://bounty.github.com/

 Basically, interested parties look for errors, report them to Github
when
 found, and get public credit and applause for finding the problem
(and the
 opportunity to disclose what they found) after it's been fixed.

The community would be better served if you first contacted plugin
authors
 and the maintainers of the WP plugin repo regarding security issues.

 If the door on your neighbor's shed was broken, making it easy for
thieves
 to enter, would you first announce it to the whole community in a
letter to
 the editor alongside an ad for your door repair services, or would
you be
 Dudley Do-Right and tell your neighbor directly?

 If you've reviewed enough code to make the claims, you can certainly
reveal
 specific vulnerabilities to the plugin authors and allow them to fix
them.
 This is pretty much the way any open source community handles
security
 issues. If you do enough of that, the money will come - if that's
what you
 want.

 After a reasonable period of time after security updates have been
released
 (or not in cases where plugin authors are unresponsive), the public
service
 announcement could follow.

 Do you contact the developers privately about your findings before
 posting them to the public?

Again: you're announcing that the neighbor's shed *should be condemned*
("unsafe to use"), based on "indications of badness, but no specific
vulnerabilities".

That is precisely where I have a problem with what you're doing.

This is definitely out of the question. If you're bothering to contact
them, most likely it's a security issue, and these should definitely
not just be posted out in the public view in an automated fashion.

You're right to continue reporting them to plugins at wordpress.org.

Hi Chris,

I've agreed previously on this thread that "Unsafe to use" was too 
categorical, and have changed that text to "Potentially unsafe". We'll 
continue to make changes to ensure we're being as clear and useful as we 
can.

On the rest of your post, we may have to agree to disagree. It is not 
commercially viable for us, or anyone else, to do comprehensive code 
reviews for free. It is not acceptable, in my opinion, that people with 
serious WordPress sites so frequently install plugins with no idea as to 
their quality or security. We're trying to help by giving people enough 
information to make slightly better decisions - for example, by focusing 
the resources they do have on more thorough examination of candidate 
plugins that are most likely to be problematic.

I hope it's clear by now that I am committed to making this site and 
process better, and I'm very happy to take criticism and feedback that 
helps us to improve. But I think, for now, for this thread, I won't 
respond to more posts that say -- more or less -- "just don't do this". 
Because I think that what we're doing does more good than harm, even 
with its imperfections.

Cheers,

Harry

I think frankly, your entire business model is backwards. As opposed
to publishing reviews without even asking for clarification, you
should instead do what bugcrowd does. Get paid to find issues. That's
a service I know I for instance, would pay for. Why aren't you doing
something like that?

(still unproven to be) comprehensive review, you can't simply Google
the name of the author, look their email up on their GitHub repo, or
plug their name into Twitter.

 It seems your entire business is based on providing mediocre (at
best) subpar reviews, which are then published to the public to
encourage users to not use what very likely could be a perfectly fine
plugin (since the highly subjective criteria of the review doesn't
even sound, by your own account that comprehensive), and then not
alert the author before publishing. Then, when said author finds out,
they in essence have to purchase your service to get their plugin
re-reviewed since, by your own account while you'll review it for
free, you may or may not have the time, and a plugin author doesn't
want false reviews online for long. And since said reviews are done by
employees of unknown skill, the outcome of said review could just as
easily be determined by rolling a dice.

 So basically an author has to pay to remove what could very likely be
slander from the internet.
 It very well seems your entire business model boils down to
monetizing the practice of slander, correct?

 Here is, based on your own account, what such a report could be:
 Avoid at all costs security.dxw.com, it is ABSOLUTELY RIDDLED WITH
MALWARE (imagine that in a giant red banner). See, we didn't really
actually review the code of said site that well, or even at all. It
was done by someone who is still learning HTML, and while we didn't
really review it, there's a possibility it contains malware, even
though we haven't proven it to exist yet. Therefore, our firm
recommendation is to avoid said site at all costs until said author
pays me $1,000,000 to re-review his site.

Hi John,

 This - more or less - is exactly how we operate.

 We have a look. If we see indications of badness, but no specific
 vulnerabilities, we write that up and publish the inspection.

 If we see vulnerabilities, we write up an advisory and disclose it
 responsibly, exactly as you suggest (details:
 https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/).

 I don't think it is necessary to disclose in advance for an
inspection,
 because we're not announcing that the neighbour's shed is broken.
We're
 announcing that neighbour's shed's looking a bit old and tatty, and
that
 people might not want to keep their stuff in it until it's fixed.

 Quite a few people have suggested that we should reach out to plugin
 authors, though. I am, in principle, happy to do that. But such a
 mechanism would have to be at least partly automated, and we have no
 private contact details for plugin authors. So, the best we could do
is
 probably to have a bot that posts on people's forums. But that's more
 notification than notice, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the
idea
 of such a bot in any event.

 If you have an idea for how we can reliably, semi-automatically give
 authors notice, and then publish after some predefined time - I'm all
ears.

 Harry

As an example of an interesting way to handle crowd-sourcing security
 reviews, check out what Github does with their Bug Bounty program:
 https://bounty.github.com/

 Basically, interested parties look for errors, report them to Github
when
 found, and get public credit and applause for finding the problem
(and the
 opportunity to disclose what they found) after it's been fixed.

Hmm. We do report vulnerabilities to plugins at wordpress.org, but not 
inspection results. I doubt they'd be terribly pleased if we did. I'll ask.

I think the idea of what DXW is doing is an okay one, but it should be
prefaced better with disclaimers and the "do not use" type of summary
should reevaluated to be a little more responsible.

At the heart of it, the issues his team is quickly reviewing are the same
things I look at when reviewing a plugin, and they are all good indicators
of potential problems or extra, unnecessary overhead.

*It is just irresponsibly reported right now in my opinion.*

Also, I would have no problem with DXWs posting this type of report in my
public forums. I am fine with that kind of transparency. Obviously, an
exploit should be private until a fix can be made available...

I definitely see both sides of this, but I don't think it is black and
white. Harry could do this in a way that would have some benefits (and
still piss some people off), but right now it isn't quite there, because it
can be misleading.

As chip said, right now you are asking to condemn a plugin because it is a
little dirty. That isn't helpful, but pointing out the dirt could be.

My two cents.
Jake.

I was under the impression that we were just talking about the

I'm actually wondering why you'd spend the time taking this on? It seems fully redundant and will be a nightmare to maintain -- for you and the plugin authors.

For instance ... suppose I get a notice that you've blacklisted a plugin for one reason or another, the author resolves the issue but you're site still reports it as a problem?

If you truly wanted to serve the community, when you see an issue why wouldn't you simply report the issue to the people at wordpress.org and let them deal with it?

WordPress.org is the only entity in the world that can enforce compliance or yank a plugin from their repository ... and therefore the plugin author is going to have to resolve any issues with them if they want their plugin listed.

I think your site is just going to create alarm and not do any real good ... unless you have someone dedicated to syncing your reviews with what's going on at wordpress.org ... which let's face it ... is going to be a big pain in the butt. I've seen sites like your's before ... here's what's likely to happen with yours: it will eventually be filled with negative reviews for issues which may have already been corrected and could turn into a real problem for some dedicated plugin authors who's livelihood may depend on their plugins.

I think you should focus your efforts into doing more to work with wordpress.org rather than trying to create a site that will likely cause more confusion and damage than it will good.

Hi list, 

I am working on a plugin that stores information in a table. In MU environments, each blog will have its own instance of that table (just like wp itself does for posts etc). Now, I am also being asked to provide a "network view" of that information. I evidently have two choices: UNION ALL on wp_*_mytable, or use a global table with blog_id. We may be talking about millions of rows per blog. So the latter approach would affect performance when analyzing the info for a given site (more frequent), I assume. 

What would you do in this case?

Thanks
Dino

Hi Dino,

Fake a materialized view (by a CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE x AS SELECT) as
MySQL doesn't support them. Update it on a regular period. This will suck
the less.

Yours sincerely

Agreed, updated as infrequently as daily. Either way your performance for
"millions of rows per blog" will take a serious hit - hope folks running
this are on their own server - not a particularly suitable situation for
VPS or otherwise, right?

So you're both saying that this would be better than putting all the records in a global table with blog_id? 

Yes, people using this have their own server.

I work for Oracle (MySQL team).

If you have an example query (and ideally can provide EXPLAIN <select statement> output), I?d be happy to tell you if it is efficient.

Hii Ian!

Thanks a ton for being so patient and helping me understand the idea well.!

I want to get a clear idea of exactly what we are going to do ! So I keep
asking you more and more Questions while presenting my own ideas as well.
And here comes again !

*Please correct me if I am wrong in the Following Idea!*

The Basic Process of Making a New Form would be as follows :

1) Website '*Admin*istrator' will go to '*Forms'* in the main admin nav
menu -> Click on a '*Add New'* Form Button(Till this Its same as we do for
a New Post) -> New Form will have *a base form* (as you suggested). He
will *customize
it* and den Save the Form(Auto-save Draft may do this) or directly
Publishes it. *(Editor has to be designed for this ! Have a basic idea, but
Cant seem to figure out how exactly would we do this on Post.php)*

2) The '*Administrator publishes the Form'*. The Form is available to
Public to fill out.

3) A '*Foreign User fills out the Form & Submits'*. As He submits, the
submitted Data is stored in *'form_submissions' table* inside the WP
database itself(Can be queried by using the "Form_ID" field)

4) The Administrator may go to '*Settings Page'* where he would be able to

Yeah, probably a dropdown of pre-defined forms, like "Speaker Proposal", 
"Volunteer Application", etc.

The Custom Post Types API takes care of most of it. You basically just 
pass the paramaters that define the post type to register_post_type(), 
and it creates a post type that has all the functionality of a normal 
post/page out of the box.

 From there, you can add meta boxes with add_meta_box() and save data in 
the postmeta table by hooking into the `save_post` action.

If you want to play around with custom post types a little bit, 
http://codex.wordpress.org/register_post_type would be a good place to 
start. There are also tons of tutorials online.

Right, like you mentioned earlier there'd probably be a shortcode that 
you could pass an ID to, so that they could embed the form into a post 
or page.

Rather than creating a custom database table, it'd be better to create a 
second post type to store submissions. It'd have a piece of metadata to 
link it back to the form ID that it is associated with.

> 4) The Administrator may go to '*Settings Page'* where he would be

If we create a second post type for submissions, then WP will 
automatically display the submitted forms for us, and we'll just have to 
add a meta box to display the custom fields.

The admins should also get an e-mail when a new submission is saved. It 
should contain all the data and a link to the post in the Admin Panels.

WordCamp.org has custom post types for Speakers, Organizers, Sponsors 
and Sessions. So, when you see a Speakers page on a WordCamp site, like 
http://2014.stlouis.wordcamp.org/speakers-list/, it's being build 
automatically from the data stored in the Speakers posts.

Right now organizers have to manually copy and paste the data (like 
their name and WordPress.org username, which is used to pull in their 
Gravatar) into the Speakers post from the form that potential speakers 
filled out.

That's something that can be automated, though. When the form is filled 
out, we can check if it's based on one of the pre-defined forms. If it's 
based on the Speaker Proposal form, then we can automatically create a 
drafted Speaker post with the speaker's name, WordPress.org username, etc.

That will save organizers a lot of time and effort. They would just have 
to publish the speakers they choose and leave the others as a draft, 
rather than having to manually create all the posts.

You can see the source code for the Speaker/etc post types at 
https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/wordcamp.org/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wc-post-types

Hi Ian!

I thought I should just make my current progress on the idea clear to you
so that you can help me in a better way. So writing this mail.

As you have always been doing, please correct me where ever I am wrong or
there is a better way to do it.

I have been conceptualizing the process of how everything will work out in
the Plugin and the functions that we may require. I am also thinking about
the features that we want to add and how exactly to go about it so as to
implement them.

I have made out the basic structure of the shortcodes which will be used to
generate the forms(done for the simple forms. For Complex ones, I have to
think).
'Any suggestions over  the Improvements/Shortcomings here are most welcome'

For Example : The UI for the Form Making will generate this sort of Short
Code which will be displayed as a Proper Form in the Form Page where ever
the Form is Placed.

"
[form_start]

[element type='text' label='Name'/]
[element type='text' label='Gender' option='M,F'/]  // Will produce two
Radio Buttons with M and F as Labels and Original Label as Gender

[/form_start]

"

For the Forms and Responses from the Forms, I read about the Custom Post
Types from the links you provided and some other links too and the basic
structure of the CPTs for forms and form_feedbacks have been laid down.

For the UI to make the Forms, I have made a Custom App( using AJAX and PHP)
(Currently Independent of WP and with limited functionality but the idea is
clear) which can be used to make the custom forms(starting from the Base
Forms). I just have to figure out a way to integrate it with WP and the its
done. 'Any Help on this would be most Welcome'.

The Email to the Admin things can be done by simply plugging the Values
into a Predefined Mail Format and using wp_mail() function.

The Feature about automatically creating the Draft of the Speakers' Post
that you told in the Previous Mail is quite interesting and would automate
a lot of work and they should be and can be incorporated into the Plugin.
And I have been trying to figure out a way to do that . I was thinking on
lines of using the Function 'wp_insert_post' with the right Variable values
to do that.



Regards,
Deven

Message-ID: <530B41D6.10504@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I've contributed a few bug reports and patches to WP core trac, but so 
far, they've all attracted no attention.

Since I'm new to contributing to core, I'm ignorant as to how to get 
some eyeballs on them. In keeping with them being first efforts, I went 
for items that were easily reproducible bugs, and easily fixed with 
simple patches. (They are all also issues that have caused me multiple 
support requests, and time spent debugging the causes, in the real-world).

Can anyone here give me a clue as to whether there's something I should 
do, or do I just lack patience? (A couple of them are 2 months old).

Tickets:
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26598 - broken methods in 
WP_Filesystem_Direct and WP_Filesystem_SSH2
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26626 - prevent avoidable unzip 
failure due to 256-character pathname limits on some platforms
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26887 - mark an implicitly public 
and important (to backup plugins) property as explicitly public (more of 
an enhancement than a bug)
https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27196 - more informative message 
when plugin install fails (I confess, I filed this one only 5 minutes 
ago - but I'm reluctant to see it suffer the same trip into limbo as the 
previous three efforts, if mentioning it can help avoid that!)

Best wishes,
David

Hi wp-hackers,

With Dino?s permission I?m sharing the email he sent me and my reply - 

???

Hi Dino,

> ORDER BY t1.dt desc
> LIMIT 0, 50
> 
> The corresponding explain is attached as explain-select-1.png.

So here is how this is working:

MySQL examines table t1 (wp_slim_stats) first and applies a sort on dt (will be expensive if there are a lot of rows).
From the largest dt value until 50 is reached, it will very efficiently do a primary key lookup on tb (wp_slim_browsers) and then tci (wp_slim_content_info).  As long as there is full participation (INNER JOIN always finds rows in this table, the joining is efficient).

Short story:
I think you need an index on wp_slim_stats.dt to avoid the sort - but otherwise it?s an efficient query.

> Now, some users have requested to get a Network View of their reports, which basically combines all the pageviews to see what post is the most popular network-wide, etc.

> In order to do that, I was thinking about two approaches: 1) do a UNION ALL of all those selects or 2) replace all the blog-specific tables with a global wp_slim_stats that includes a new column blog_id.

> The latter seems to be easier to implement, but what about performances? Think about a network with 100 blogs that make 100k pageviews/month. The new global table would have 100x100k = 10M records.

You would not be UNION?ing ALL millions of rows though, you?d be UNIONing top 50 from all tables right?  As long as you can use the indexes (like the query you specified), then the number of rows in the table doesn?t matter.  I think as long as it is efficient enough, this is probably the more desired option?

In MySQL until 5.7 (currently in developer preview) UNION ALL needs to creates a temporary table to buffer results before sending them to the client (so there is a small level of inefficiency), so make sure that each query being unioned doesn?t have too many rows.  More information on this optimization on my blog here:

I'd not advise pursuing this approach to shortcodes...

A single shortcode to output the form by id or name is the current (and best) practice.

See: every other form plugin available for WordPress.

Running dozens of short codes to output a form that's already been designed on the backend? That's going to use a lot of resources -- for what gain? Not to mention how brittle this approach is... e.g. can I intermix other shortcodes within a form? What if those also output a <form> element, breaking your form?

PS- Always prefix your shortcodes to avoid collisions with other plugins & themes.

Thanks Nick !

I had not realized that. ! Thanks for pointing it out. ! :)

I will now take it into account and start thinking of an alternative way to
do it where I just have to take in the Form ID/Name as arguments for the
short code.

I have an idea that User would make the form with the UI(opening in a new
iframe I guess from a Button in post.php?post_type=form)
and then save it. The Plugin will save the final HTML of the Form in the
"post_content" in "wp_posts" as "Draft" with CPT of "form".

User can use the Shortcode in any post/page with the Form ID if they want
or can just publish this 'form' as it is.

Will keep the mailing list posted on any new development ! Suggestions and
Advices are always welcome. !

Thanks.

Regards,
Deven

Deven,

Please download a few popular form plugins and see how they handle things -- they've already solved the problems you're facing -- the beauty of open source is that you can learn from other's code.

http://formidablepro.com
http://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/

Making a new form in an iframe popup is a interesting idea -- would be good for quick forms. However, is that the workflow users will use? Or will they author the the form and them want to insert it into (possibly multiple) posts/pages/widgets? I'm not saying either way is correct, I'm asking you to evaluate the best workflow for your users before making architectural decisions.

Saving the HTML is probably not what you want to do -- forms are dynamic things -- so the are generally best generated each time, so they can take into account the current state (required fields, errors, etc). i.e. Save the meta data about the form in custom fields on the custom post type instead, then generate the form when it's viewed.

Message-ID: <CAMg3evGz-pjtMch0K2btiTC1ZUiVZaJTL__s=gu-Xw928gTd2g@mail.gmail.com>

A while ago I posted a question which resulted in a suggestion to rely on
the "magic methods" of get_users() to  reference the first name and last
name fields stored as user meta data.

http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2012-June/043340.html

I am revisiting this because I've had a report from one user of a plugin
which makes uses of this that their first name and last name fields are
always empty.  Does anyone know of a reason why in some instances this data
wouldn't be populated?

Hi Nick & Deven

Adding to the dialogue, @Deven - Nick has some valid points.  You can zero
in on a lot of best practices by looking at other forms plugins. I have
been working on this too.

One plausible way I could come up with was using custom-post-type and its
custom-fields. I quickly hooked these and came up with a basic workflow
like this - http://i.imgur.com/VzO3UV6.png

@Nick - Your feedback on this will definitely help!

Which version of WP are they using? I think that before the introduction of
the WP_User object, objects returned from get_users() were just normal
StdClass objects which therefore don't have magic methods and would return
null(I believe) when you try to access an unset property(and raise a
warning depending on the error levels) which in turn when converted to
string becomes an empty string.

That is my suspicion as well.  I don't have an answer yet as to what
version of PHP and what version of WordPress the person reporting the
problem is running on.  According to the Codex, the WP_Users magic methods
were added in 3.3 so it is hard for me to believe this user is using a
version of WordPress that old.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How to install a new theme?
Message-ID: <20140224135956.2587eee6@mydesk>

Hi all,

I'm running WordPress on Ubuntu 13.10, installed via Ubuntu's normal
package. From http://127.0.0.1/blog/wp-admin/themes.php , I go to the
Install Themes tab, search for ryu, click "Install Now", and I get "To
perform the requested action, WordPress needs to access your web
server. Please enter your FTP credentials"

I'd rather not give someone FTP or sftp access, and besides, I'm behind
a firewall, but no problem: I just downloaded ryu myself, unzipped it
into /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/themes/ryu in exactly the same way
as the
preexisting /usr/share/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen, but
when I went to WordPress, ryu wasn't shown as an installed theme. No
problem, I logged out and back into Wordpress, same problem. I stopped
and started Apache: Same problem. I rebooted the computer. Same problem.

Twentytwelve is installed too. I think I installed it yesterday without
these problems, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I grepped the
entire /usr/share/wordpress tree for "twentytwelve" and, other than the
files inside the theme itself, I came up with the following files:

* wp-admin/includes/update-core.php
* wp-content/languages/*.mo
* wp-includes/class-wp-theme.php

At that point I decided to quit experimenting and ask for help. Ideally
I'd like to be able to install a new theme *both* the automatic way
from my WordPress site (but without giving WP an (s)ftp login), and by
downloading the theme .zip and incorporating it into my installation.

I read on the Internet various descriptions of the "ftp credentials"
problem as being a permissions problem or something you fix with chown,
but all these posts conflicted with each other in the details so I
decided to ask here. For all I know it's just because my Ubuntu machine
is behind a firewall.

Thanks,

Steve

Hi Steve,

After unzipping the theme into "ryu", is there an "ryu" directory
inside it? If so you'll need to move the files inside it up one level.

Eg. this is wrong:

ryu
 - ryu
    - index.php
    - style.css

This is right:

ryu
 - index.php
 - style.css

If that's not the problem then I've no idea what's wrong. Installing a
theme is very straight forward. The only other thing it could be is an
opcode cache, but that should get flushed when restarting the server
or the machine.

John

Hi Steve,

I don't think that the problem should be that you are behind a firewall -
after all you're accessing localhost at 127.0.0.1 so I don't think that the
firewall should matter.

The problem with WordPress asking for FTP credentials is that the
permissions for wp-content do not allow it to write files and directories.
That means that if WordPress(read PHP) is run as the www-data user then the
permissions that would allow it read/write access to the wp-content
directory are 0755. From a terminal you can run the following commands(omit
the "sudo" part if you are logged-in as root):

cd /var/www/blog/
sudo chmod 0755 wp-content/
cd wp-content/
sudo find -type f -exec chmod 0644 {} \;
sudo find -type d -exec chmod 0755 {} \;

What the above would do is to change the permissions on the wp-content
folder to ones that allow WordPress read/write access to it. After that we
would give write access to all files and directories within wp-content -
you don't have to do that, but if you want to be able to use the
theme/plugin editor you need to do so.

After you do that, open Files(the file manager of Ubuntu 13.10), go to
/var/www/blog/wp-content/themes/ and manually delete the theme folder. Then
you should be able to install the theme through WordPress(which will
automatically give it the right permissions and ownership).

If you're only going to use the installation for development purposes, you
can do what I tend to do:
 - Change the group to which of all files and directories belong to a group
that my current user belongs to(usually the same as the username).
Alternatively you can just add your user to the www-data group.
 - Change the permissions of all directories to 0775 and the permissions of
all files to 0664.

This allows me to change files via a text editor and allows WordPress to
write all of the files that it wants to.

Why don't you just add

define( 'WPLANG', 'en_IN' );

to your wp-config.php file?
This should change the result of get_locale() - which should be used in the
basis of all functions that you described above - and unless you already
have a translation file for en_IN, then all strings will remain the same as
the original strings(which are all in en_US).

It's more complex than just permissions.

Consider the most common case:
- User has username of "bob".
- Webserver runs as "www-data".

This means that the WordPress PHP files are owned by "bob", but the
webserver executes as the "www-data" user. Now, whether or not the
webserver has permissions to write to those files and/or directories is
really irrelevant. Any files that the webserver creates are going to be
created as being owned by the "www-data" user, not by "bob".

In a shared hosting environment, where there might also be "alice" and
"carl" running web software of their own, this is a security issue. If
Bob's files are owned by "www-data", then Alice can write code herself, run
it through the webserver (as "www-data") and thus access Bob's files
inappropriately. Bob doesn't like that one bit.

So, WordPress protects against this scenario. When it tries to write files,
it makes certain that the act of writing a file is not just possible due to
permissions, but also that the resulting file will be owned by "bob", and
not by "www-data". It does this by the simple method of writing a test
file, and comparing the ownership of the file to the pre-existing WordPress
PHP files already on the system (specifically, against the
/wp-admin/includes/file.php file, where the get_filesystem_method()
function is).

If the file owners don't match, then it decides not to use the "direct"
writing approach, and switches to one of the other methods instead, like
FTP or SSH. In these methods, it can use the credentials given to make a
connection back to the machine (loopback, basically) and authenticate in
the process. Any files it writes through this connection will get the
ownership of the new credentials ("bob").

The point is to make sure that the files end up being owned by "bob",
because that's the secure choice. On a multiuser environment, ownership
matters more than permissions.

If you want to eliminate that FTP prompt and use the "direct" method in a
multi-user environment, install "suphp" instead of the normal PHP, or use
one of the many methods to run your PHP process using "suexec" permissions.
Google for "fastcgi suexec" for examples of how to do this in your
environment. In this sort of setup, the PHP process switches itself to be
running as "bob". This is secure because "alice" can't write a program on
her environment as "bob", so her processes run as "alice" and still cannot
access Bob's files.

The preceding, which you label as "right" is how I did it. Its contents
looked pretty much like the twentytwelve and twentythirteen

Yeah, I was figuring it was some kind of cache, which is why I
restarted everything. John, you've given me some valuable info: What I
was doing *should* have worked, and is the right way of doing it. So
now it's just a matter of getting Wordpress to conform to its
as-designed behavior.

Hello Nikola,

I should have clarified that I am using WordPress Multisite, and as there's
only one wp-config.php file, I don't think it's possible. Or is it?

>From what I read, in my given case (WordPress Multisite) I need the
language files to enable a specific language via the individual site's
settings in the network admin.

Thanks Otto,

As a diagnostic test,
within /usr/share/wordpress/wp-admin/includes/file.php, I modified the
get_filesystem_method() function by putting $method = 'direct'; after
the code that tested the temp file's owner against the return value of
getmyuid(), and indeed, it no longer asked me for my ftp creds, and
indeed started installing something (I was trying to install k2).
However, Wordpress then aborted with "Could not create
directory. /var/lib/wordpress/wp-content/upgrade". So I created the
upgrade dir and it got a little farther, chowned it www-data.www-data
and it got farther but griped that couldn't write
to /var/lib/wordpress/wp-content/themes/k2, so I chowned themes
www-data.www-data, and it succeeded installing, but the preview was the
dreaded blank preview.

So, all this proves that what you said is true. To get it to work (in a
diagnostic mode), I probably need to fix a few other things. And then
figure out the real solution :-)

I'm curious why the Ubuntu 13.10 packager installed Wordpress has
everything owned and grouped by root, with write permissions only for
root. Is their package defective?

This stuff is exactly why I chose to learn all of this on my own
personal machine before making a blog on my web host. Thanks for this
detailed info, Otto.

WPLANG is settable on a per-site basis in multisite. Just go to the
/wp-admin/network, Sites->All Sites, pick your site from the list and
click the "Edit" link, go to the Settings tab for that site, and
scroll down until you find the WPLANG setting. Same setting, same type
of values.

Then just name your files appropriately in the wp-content/languages directory.

It is my considered opinion that using any distribution's "packaged"
version of WordPress is a bad idea. I don't know why they do this sort
of thing to begin with.

Install the webserver, php, mysql, etc. from your package manager of
choice. Then find the relevant public_html folder and put your own
copy of WordPress in there, directly from the zip or tarball from
WordPress.org.

Makes little to no sense to use a package manager for installing
WordPress, except that it might configure a database for you, which
takes all of a minute to do yourself.

Excellent, and just in time, as I was going to deinstall and reinstall
WordPress to try again. Where would I find documentation on how to do
the database config you speak of?

If you have a decent machine (Core2Duo or recent - no CodeDuo) then try
this: https://puphpet.com/

It will help you to get much more easier a proper development environment
to test and work. I never looked back since I found Vagrant and Puppet.

Thank you, Otto. It's amazing how easy it was once I followed your
advice, got rid of the Ubuntu installed WordPress, and unzipped the zip
file downloaded from wordpress.org, following the directions at
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress . 

It took me about an hour, considering I was very careful in following
the instructions, and doing stuff not mentioned by the documentation,
like chown -R www-data.www-data blogg. Yeah, I spelled blogg with two
g's because I got a not found if I spelled it with one g, probably a
defective vestige of the Ubuntu Wordpress installation I blew away.

It took me two minutes to install a new theme, and doing so required no
brains at all.

Otto, thank you for giving me detailed, correct and topical technical
information that allowed me to do this.

Subject: [wp-hackers] How I kludged a new image for TwentyThirteen
Message-ID: <20140224202138.57763748@mydesk>

Hi all,

Not liking any of the images provided with the TwentyThirteen theme, I
made my own image and thumbnail in Inkscape. I made them the same size
as the original three, and named them just like the original three (I
called mine sky.png and sky-thumbnail.png.

However, no matter how many times I logged out and in and restarted
apache2, I couldn't select my new image. Copying my images over
circle.png and circle-thumbnail.png showed that the problem was that
the list of images was something other than the contents of
wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/images/headers, and a grep command
(grepped for "circle") showed file
wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/inc/custom-header.php, which contained
an array of the three images I saw in the header image selection. So I
made a fourth element in the array for my Sky images, saved, logged out
and in again, and my Sky image is now available as a header image.

There's probably a better/easier way to do it, but I couldn't find it
with Google.

Anyway, thanks for all your help.

Hello all,

I don't know if this belongs here or stackoverflow but I'm just
wondering if anyone know if I can update a user's profile when I don't
know the user id but I do know something that will match up if I use
the *_user_meta stuff.

Thank-you for the quick reply, the only thing is that the data is in
the wp_usermeta table. Maybe I should consider moving the data from
wp_usermeta into the wp_users table.

Hello Otto,

WPLANG option in the individual site settings in network admin won't save
until there are necessary language files. Hence the question, what's the
simplest way to create language files?

Can I simply download the UK English (en_GB) version of WordPress and
simply replace all instances of en_GB in the language file names (files
residing in wp-content/languages) with en_IN? Is that sufficient?

If yes (to the question right above), where can I get the language files
for en_US? I'd prefer US English to UK English in the dashboard; I am used
to it.

The simplest way would be to contribute to the existing translations:
http://translate.wordpress.org

Alternatively, get the POT files and use your own po-editing tool of
choice to make a translation yourself:
http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/pot/tags/3.8/

Yes, it's simply reading the filenames to determine what languages are
installed.

There is no set of en_US files, as that's the fallback position. It's
what is translated from, not to.

Actually, install and activate Codestyling
Localization<http://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/>on
your WordPress site. Then go to Tools > Localization and click on the
"Add new language" button that is across from "WordPress".
Select your language(en_IN - I assume it's existing, but I haven't
checked). Once it's created click on the "Rescan" button across from the
language - it opens a pop-up and you click "scan now".
Once that's done, click on the "Edit" button across from the language.
This will take you to the screen where you can translate all the strings.
Make a simple change - for instance click "edit" on the first string you
see and copy/paste the text in the "Original" textarea to the "Translation"
textarea. On top of the screen, click on the "generate mo-file", which will
generate the correct mo-file for you, but it will pretty much be blank.

That should be it - the file should be saved in the proper location and now
you should be able to use en_IN in your site.

Hmmm - I just checked the plugin and it doesn't seem to support en_IN. You
can probably still use this approach and then just rename the .mo file(you
might have to look at the file and see if there is locale information in
it).

Hello Otto,

> The simplest way would be to contribute to the existing translations:
> http://translate.wordpress.org

I don't Indian English applies to the web. Indian English differs in the
day-to-day stuff that we hear, for example, we call it "godown" whereas in
American English it'd probably be "warehouse". If there was any meaningful
way of translating WordPress to Indian English, I'd have tried. =)

Hello Nikola,

I'll give it a shot today.

Thank you, to the two of you!

Hi!
@Teja

 : Thanks ! I will keep that in mind now on! :)

@Nick : Thanks a lot for the guidance. I will surely checkout the way in
which these plugins work. ! Will keep you posted!

Meanwhile, I had thought of an UI like this and I wanted to have
suggestions on that.

http://i.imgur.com/YrHWFC4.png?1

@Ian :
The Feature
,
that you suggested for the base forms
, 
can be added as shown.

The Form Builder Meta
 

Box will help the user to build the Forms. As soon as the User Clicks the
'Add New Element' button, the 'New Element' Box Pops up. User Fills out all
the Properties related to this Element which will include all the
conditions, custom error msgs, parent field  and all
 and clicks 'Add'
.
 The New element gets added to the Form(not shown here) and the New
Element Popup goes away. 
(Not many
element 
properties have been shown here,
They 
will be added later)

Thus,
 
the User does this for all the Elements and then clicks 'Save the Form'.
Now all the Meta Data is stored and the Form can be published.

 The area besides the New Element Box will continuously show the Live Form
fields and their order which can be changed by simple drag and drop.

Once the Form is saved, The Plugin will automatically generate a
*
Form
_
ID
*
that will be passed onto post-content to show up when the form is loaded.
The Plugin will generate the JS required for simple fields validation
automatically from the Properties that user enters for the Element while he
was adding it.

The Plugin may also provide an option to add a few lines before the actual
form starts. For example, the lines written in the text
 
box shown in the right!

Once the Structure for the forms and UI for the form making has been
finalized, I will start
 
thinking
 
on how the submitted forms will be handled and presented to the admin. !

Please provide your feedback on this and correct me if I am wrong
anywhere. ! :)

Thanks.

Regards,
Deven

Ya. I have just conceptualized the Workflow till now!
I hope most of the things I am Planning for, will be done by JS and AJAX
with a little PHP in the backend.

I am attaching two empty divs for Element Properties(Shown) and One for
Live Form Fields(Not shown) in the Meta Box itself.

Once an User clicks the Add Element button JS comes into Pic and it creates
a small form for taking in the Properties. Then as the user clicks 'Add'
button, AJAX enters. It sends it to a Handler PHP in the background which
in turn stores the current situation of the form in wp_postmeta.

This continues till all the elements are done.!

Then as the User clicks Save the Form. The Handler.php(in the Plugin
Folder) finalizes everything and passes the Form_ID into post_content which
plugin will use to display the Form when a Responder sees it.

Finally enter all the other fields on the post.php and click on 'Publish'
(Here 'Update'). And You are done !

Please correct me if I am wrong anywhere. Also advice if something may not
be possible to do or if there is a better way to do it.

Regards,
Deven

I have read the codex and i am particularly interested in working on the
"java script unit test coverage" project as i feel i have good knowledge of
js and jquery. Can somebody please tell me what i need to do and give an
in-depth idea of the project so that i can start working on the project.
Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

@Deven - This is interesting. Meanwhile, I have been thinking if post meta
is a good way to implement the forms? Each form would a number of
sub-elements and attributes. Can this be handled? Would it be better off
having a new data type. Most of the forms plugins seem to do it this way...

Ya, I understand that it would require a lot of rows. Will think about it
and tell .

But Sorry could not understand you on 'new data type'. Are you suggesting
to make a Separate table in the DB for storing all the things related to a
form ?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Post name permalinks and default post types
Message-ID: <CA+-Vqo9L1P+7BqQEruzdSGqVSfWTkYnUqAoBVNy2avcupmC3PA@mail.gmail.com>

So, I was combing the internet on how to implement the elusive%postname%
permalink for a custom post type.  I know that it can be done without a
performance hit now but I  was running into issues on how to implement it.
 Everything I tried either didn't work or worked but screwed up permalinks
for pages.  I think I have a solution but I wanted to run it by a few
people to make sure I don't inadvertantly cause any issues:

Basically, I've found that the reason post name permalinks are so tricky is
that WordPress doesn't know what post type to use.  Any rewrite I did would
override page's rewrite or cause WP_Query to default to post.  So, after
much problems and testing, I did 3 things:

1. I set the post type in question to have rewrite set to false

2. Used add_permastruct to create the post name permastructure so WP can
create the permalink

3. (the part I'm worried about) used the parse_query to resolve the
conflict issue:
$post_name = $query->get( 'name' );
$post_type = $query->get( 'post_type' );
if( ! empty( $post_name ) && empty( $post_type ) ) {
$query->set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'page', 'custom_post_type' ) );
}

So basically, if name is set and post type isn't set, set the post type to
post, page and the custom post type.

My question is can anyone with greater knowledge than I to the inner
workings of WP, think of any unforeseen side effects to doing it this way?
 So far it seems fine to me; doesn't screw up pages or my custom post type.
 Only thing tht might be a problem if there is a post of another post type
with the same name, but I'm not sure how WP handles duplicate post names of
different post types.

Thank you for any comments!

I've just been experimenting with this today. This method is working for
me:
https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/remove-the-slug-from-your-custom-post-type-permalinks/


Only thing tht might be a problem if there is a post of another post type

The default single.php template is used, but the loop will loop through to
show all posts with the same slug.

Apart from this, the only side effect I have so far discovered is that if
you trash one of the duplicate posts you will get a 404 for the other one
until you delete it permanently.

Cheers

Hello everyone,

First of all, I?m not a student. I just want to propose an idea for this GSoC: ?Inline editing of posts directly on any page.?.

I?m co-founder of Froala Editor (http://editor.froala.com) and I think that our inline mode of the editor would work very well with Wordpress. The main idea is to allow people to edit their posts directly on the webpage without having to go to the admin interface. Don?t worry about the license, we can update it to allow Wordpress users to use it for free and overcome any legal issues related to it.

Short bio about me: 
http://linkedin.com/in/stefanneculai
https://github.com/stefanneculai

I can help mentoring it and I am willing to support any changes required to the editor to make it Wordpress compliant. Looking forward to hear from you. 


Stefan

You should familiarize yourself with Qunit (http://qunitjs.com/intro/), which is the JS testing framework that WordPress uses. You will also want to familiarize yourself with WordPress?s use of JS in general. Other than that, I?m afraid I can?t offer much help.

If you'd like to collaborate with somebody to release a plugin for your
editor, you need to release a GPL 2/3 compatible version to comply with
WordPress and a question would be, what advantages would it offer above
other popular solutions already implemented.

It's not new at all, there are a few solutions that are a few years old and
quite popular.

One of the best: http://scribu.net/wordpress/front-end-editor/

Still, another one it's always good to come. Please Stefan, can you detail
the licence type you can offer if you'd like it in the WordPress.org repos
(must comply with the terms of WordPress.org)

There is currently a Front End Editor plugin in progress, which is
being developed as a feature as a plugin:
http://wptavern.com/wordpress-front-end-editor-plugin-gets-major-updates
. This means the plugin is being developed with an eye on potentially
being included in WordPress core at some point in the future. More
info: http://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/

Of course, it doesn't mean you shouldn't tackle a new approach yourself!

I should say that successful implementations of the front-end editor are
new (like Concrete5). Don't mean to jump in the middle of your conversation
Madalin, but it's an open discussion.

We are willing to offer a license that allow all Wordpress users to use it for free current and all further improved versions - as far as I know this would be compliant with the GPL license. Would that work?

What would be the steps involved in order to get it from a plugin to a core feature?

Do you think it would work as a GSoC project?

Thanks,
Stefan

What would be the best way to check if bootstrap is added (enqueue) so I
don?t load it twice.

Also any plans on adding bootstrap to core shipped scripts?

Someone doing that as a GSoC project is probably not a good idea since there are already several solutions, one of which, as John pointed out, is a potential feature developed as a plugin that I'm working on.

If anyone is interested in developing a Front-end editor, let's work together on this rather than starting similar projects independently. I'm not saying this plugin is *the* solution. It's always good to look at other approaches. It would just be better to have only one project with good discussions and communication, even if that means creating more than one plugin or branch.

The plugin can be found on wordpress.org (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-front-end-editor/) and is developed on GitHub (https://github.com/avryl/wp-front-end-editor).

The best approach in my opinion is to use "bootstrap" as it's handle in
wp_register/enqueue_style - after all you shouldn't really need different
version of bootstrap(or multiple instance of bootstrap) on the same page.

Of course you can probably hook late to wp_enqueue_scripts and go through
all of the enqueued styles and see if there's anything that contains
bootstrap. Obviously that's an overkill and will not always work.

Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com is a frontend framework that should be
available normally only on theme level.

If you're building a theme with Bootstrap, you should not worry that it
would be loaded by something else as it should not (if you find a plugin
that does it, well, the plugin author doesn't likes some good practices and
standards).

The theme is the presentation layer and the top layer of WordPress and only
it should handle this kinds of libraries.

It shouldn't be included in the core as there are dozens of alternatives
and Bootstrap isn't a standard, it's just popular; there are others better
done with more features then Bootstrap (well, maybe just my opinion).

Reason I ask, is my plugin makes gravityforms into bootstrap, and I don?t
want to load the bootstrap css and js if its already loaded.

I know I could add an admin_notices saying bootstrap css/js required, etc.

I do agree and I really like your work on it. I see that you are currently using TinyMCE there and I believe that Froala Editor would fit better for few reasons. First of all it?s lightweight and it offers all basic functionality that TinyMCE comes with too, but in addition it?s the first editor that supports image resize on mobile devices. Also, you can?t ignore the nice flat design from inline mode. 

Moreover, I will offer all my support to make the editor fit the requirements and do any necessary changes to make it fit the plugin. Can we talk more about it on Skype (my Skype id is in the signature)?

That's nice to find out of a plugin that alters gravity forms output
optimized for Bootstrap.

You could create an options page with a simple question: load bootstrap or
not?

Let the user choose.

I found the slug for bootstrap named in dozens of ways by theme authors and
you can't keep up with them as nobody respects a standard like use
something like "bootstrap" and "bootstrap-component". If everybody would do
that, we would have a better world :D

I think that leaving the option to the user to disable loading bootstrap
from your plugin is the best way, so play with conditions ;)

WordPress TinyMCE is a modified version to make the "content" in editor in
the standards that have been decided by the community.

You would need to alter Froala to make sure the "content" is preserved as
currently is. You need to check the WordPress documentation to understand
the filters that are applied to the content, how plugins and themes can
hook in this filters to add additional modifications. You also need to make
a nice usable API so plugin/themes authors can easily extend your editor on
the fly.

We can't just replace the current modified TinyMCE with another editor
without preparing it for WordPress.

And the hole "editor" system isn't just an editor, it's a more complex
system with some other components in it forming the "editor" as it's called.

TinyMCE is used is because that's what core uses. Using a different editor would mean changing a lot of code, used for both the front- and back-end editor, that assumes TinyMCE. You can't just replace TinyMCE with another editor without breaking things.
The design of your editor is not really a good argument, it gets changed anyway. :)

@Stefan - I took a quick look at your editor and I have to admit that it
does look pretty awesome!

Here are *my* thoughts on why it could be difficult/impossible to implement
your editor in WordPress:

Unfortunately since TinyMCE is the built-in editor for WordPress, you can't
just toss it out the window(I realize that this is not what you are
suggesting, but having different editors would bring inconsistencies
between the front/back-editing of content).
There are lots of plugins and themes out there that add basic or advanced
functionality to the TinyMCE editor - either enabling built-in(but disabled
by default) functionality, or adding something completely new.

That means that you should somehow offer support for that extra
functionality - or at the very least you should avoid JS errors. In order
to add that support to your editor, I assume that it would loose some of
it's advantages(like being lightweight for instance). The very minimum of
what you would need to add support for is all of the built-in WordPress
extensions to TinyMCE(read gallery shortcodes, custom link button, etc.)

Then there is the issue of the different approaches UI-wise - TinyMCE has
it's toolbar visible all of the time at the top of the content - you show
styling buttons upon selecting some text(which is kind of cool). This would
create two different experiences for the users(one when editing in the
back-end and one when editing in the front-end), which can be confusing to
some users(sadly for me not everyone is tech-savvy or sometimes not even
close to being tech-savvy).

Honestly I would be happy to see a nice editor(although I don't have a lot
of complaints with TinyMCE at the moment) make it's way into WordPress, but
it's definitely something that would either not happen, or would take a
long time.

No. The code would have to be itself licensed under the GPL or a
compatible license. Keeping it proprietary but "free of cost" is not
good enough.

@Madalin: is there a link where I can read about it? I looked over the documentation but couldn?t find more about it.

@Janneke: I see. Probably the current approach is better for the moment. It looks like there are some updates needed for Froala Editor and I think it may come as an alternative sometime in the future.

@Nikola: Thanks for your thoughts. :-)

@Otto: Got it.

oh, sorry, my bad, the official documentation about the editor is very
poor, you may start digging from here:
https://codex.wordpress.org/TinyMCEor like most of us here in WP from
the source.

It's not just updates to your editor. TinyMCE is integrated with the media uploader, autosave, wp_editor()...

Ya for example, I looked at ?the-bootstrap? on the themes directory on
wordpress.org

The handler used is tw-bootstrap

And for example strap press from bragthemes uses bootstrap-styles and
bootstrap-scripts for the bootstrap .css and .js

Probably the best way is to use an option

I'm a student looking forward to take part in GSoC 2014 , specifically the
WordCamp Mobile App Project. Part of the app's functionality is to get some
data from the WordCamp website and display it in a mobile friendly manner.

I wanted to know how will this data sourced ?Will the website provide an
API or do we have to poll the website and extract the required data from
the page's HTML code ?

If the site does not have an API , do we have to create one (server
side/backend) or is the task just to create an app (client side/frontend).

 Thanks

Hey Yatin,

Currently there are no API?s yet for that. I once started a bit but ended because of this.
You can find the ticket here https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/222.

For me this would be a great GSoC project and I would say we probably could have something working by then.
So the focus would then be the app only.

Best,
Marko

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2014: Form / Survey Plugin
Message-ID: <CANP2YWEwrccJAziFEbLS_MTfU1ZRZqbLS7P0tzQqH7Aj9ST51Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm a student looking forward to take part in GSoC 2014. I would love to
take part in the Form / Survey Plugin; "This project would focus on
creating a forms/surveys plugin based on the needs of the community
outreach team to support WordCamps and Meetups. "

I haven't been active in the WordPress development community before, but
I'm very interested to one day become a core contributor to the WordPress
project. As part of the requirements to take part in GSoC 2014, I have
written a WordPress Plugin called "Quote me".
Quote me displays a quote rotator and the admin is able to add, edit and
delete Quotes. When Quote me is install, the first time a visitor lands on
your site, she sees a Quote Rotator and she can choose to opt out. When the
visitor lands on the Quote, Quote me sets a session and the visitor won't
see the quote Rotator again until her session expires.  I got my
inspiration for Quote me from Forbes.com. When you visit Forbes for the
first time, Forbes first display a "Thought of the day" before redirecting
to the page you are requesting. I did some modifications in my version; For
instance, I display several quotes (Quote Ratator). You can find Quote me
at https://github.com/quincykwende/quote-me. Also, I just submitted Quote
me for review.

For the Form / Survey Plugin, here is a summary of my User Requirements:

   - Users (admin privilege) would be able to manage forms / surveys (add,
   edit, delete).
   - Users (admin privilege) would be able to set a variety of question
   types / form item; Multiple choice with check boxes, Multiple choice with
   radio button, Multiple choice to select from a drop down, Multiple choice
   for multiple select from a drop down, Single and multiple file upload,
   Regular questions with input field and or text-area for answers
   - Users (admin privilege) would be able to easily add question types and
   do basic theming on the forms (use jQuery to add new form item). (Similar
   to Google Forms)
   - Users (admin privilege) would be able to place form any where on their
   site, For instance on a page, post
   - Users would be able to invite their contacts, colleagues and or
   friends to participate in surveys.
   - Users would be able to share their forms / surveys via Google+,
   Facebook, Twitter etc.
   - Users (admin privilege) would be able view basic reporting / analytics
   of surveys (system shall display statistics and analysis using
   Highercharts; http://www.highcharts.com/ )

I would be glad, if I can get advice and more ideas on the above project in
order to have an awesome plugin.

> Hey Marko,

It's great to know that an API is under development.
I was thinking of developing the app using the PhoneGap framework, that way
we can not only speed up development but since PhoneGap uses standard web
technologies (HTML,CSS,JS) the Wordpress community will be able to
contribute to it easily as well.

As of the API , I have some questions (some of these may seem stupid as I
am not good at php) -

1.What does term mean in "get_terms" ?
2.What is the difference between "get_wordcamp" and "get_wordcamps" ?

Thanks,
Yatin

Another question,I was looking at the Wordpress GSoC Application Form
and  noticed that there is a significant emphasis on php experience and
knowledge. But since this my project does not require excellent php
knowledge , do you think my lack in this respect will hamper my chances of
getting selected in GSoC ?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Best way to avoid mixed http/https content
Message-ID: <53107D54.2050907@wordshell.net>

Hi,

I'm aware that there are *lots* of ways to avoid mixed http/https 
content warnings, but I'm looking for any insight into the best way of 
doing this. The use case is for a site that is intended to be available 
over both http and https.

In particular, I'm talking about content inside posts. (Not about the 
admin area, or plugin resources (e.g. JavaScript, CSS)).

The WordPress editor always inserts full links for media. i.e. It 
includes the uploads URL setting (which can of course be set in 
different ways). This is good, because it means that you can move the 
site from one place to another, and you just need to search/replace the 
URLs. However, that doesn't work well if the site is meant to be 
available via both http and https. It'll cause mixed content warnings.

So, you could manually edit the links to remove the protocol. i.e. 
change your image links from 
https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/etc.png to 
//example.com/wp-content/uploads. That's rather cumbersome, though - and 
makes the search/replace (slightly) more complex when moving from live 
to staging/dev, etc. If you change to relative links, 
/wp-content/uploads, then that's also cumbersome, and makes any 
search/replace very dangerous.

So, I think the best solution to this is probably a plugin that 
dynamically filters the post output, depending on whether is_ssl() is true.

Does this seem right? If so, any suggested plugins? 
http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/ looks like the "big beast" 
in the area, but to my mind a plugin author who can't be bothered to 
update his readme.txt beyond " Compatible up to: 3.5.2" isn't committed, 
so you're setting yourself up for future trouble by ignoring that red 
flag. Presumably this simple use case could be done with just a quick 
filter on the content and I should do that. Again, I'm wondering if 
anyone has experience/advice on this.

Best wishes,
David

A ?term? is a generic name for an item in a taxonomy (http://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies). For example, categories are the terms in the category taxonomy, and tags are the terms in the tags taxonomy.

Hi Yatin, `get_wordcamp()` (singular) would retrieve a complete set of 
data on a specific WordCamp, while `get_wordcamps()` (plural) would 
retrieve a minimal set of data about all WordCamps.

The PHP requirement is highly relevant for most GSoC projects, but the 
mobile app is probably an exception to that. Having PHP experience 
wouldn't hurt, but I'm guessing that whoever mentors that project will 
be looking mostly at your experience with mobile development.

This just came up in a recent thread, I think, but I can't find it in the archive.

The gist was: 

Either filter post content to switch http:// to https:// (or vice versa) or use protocol relative urls:
http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/

Ideally you'd switch to protocol relative URLs on save_post instead on display for maximum performance (i.e. then you're only filtering the content once).

My vote here is to use native code and not PhoneGap. I know we can use it but for the best user experience it?s best to do this native.
I think doing PhoneGap is a to easy road for GSoC but I can be wrong but I do agree with you that it will make contributing back easier.

You can compile PhoneGap into a native app using Adobe CC.

Subject: [wp-hackers] filtering uploads_dir
Message-ID: <CF36685C.8027%chris@lod.com>

What would be the proper way to filter uploads dir, even though a plugin is
already doing it, download monitor runs a filter on uploads_dir, which
stores the dir to write files, when I run a filter it adds the prefix before
the download directory specified by the plugin filter, I want to replace it.

I do want to keep the date intact.

function expire_upload_filter() {
    if ( isset( $_POST['type'] ) && $_POST['type'] == 'dlm_download' ) {
            add_filter( 'upload_dir', 'expire_set_upload_dir' );
    }
}

add_action('admin_init', 'expire_upload_filter');

function expire_set_upload_dir($upload) {
    $upload['subdir']   = '/expire' . $upload['subdir'];
    $upload['path'] = $upload['basedir'] . $upload['subdir'];
    $upload['url'] = $upload['baseurl'] . $upload['subdir'];
    return $upload;
}

This will just prefix /expire/dlm_uploads

Since the uploaddir function is already prefixing dlm_uploads

I?m talking about native code as in objective-c or Java. I do understand what PhoneGap is and does.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Best way to avoid mixed http/https content
Message-ID: <CANWKvSyBDABt=tzpDYxD3boxTvAFTToNgLMcH5Yt_tV6Jx_8BA@mail.gmail.com>

There are two "best" methods for avoiding content mismatch errors.
Personally I would argue that you should enforce AlwaysOn SSL, but that is
another conversation entirely and not what you asked about :)

1) Always reference over https. When you're in https mode, you obviously
won't get content mismatch errors. When you're in http mode, you can safely
reference https content. This ensures safety no matter how a site visitor
asks for a page.

2) The beginning of your absolute path does not HAVE to include the
protocol. RFC's many many years ago implemented the standard where you can
safely remove the http: or https: and just start from the double-slashes.
When you do this, the site visitor's browser will load the resource over
whatever protocol it is currently in... HTTP requests will load all of
those referenced resources over HTTP, and HTTPS requests will do so over
HTTPS.

My guess is you will want/need a plugin to enforce one of these rules on
output, but hopefully this knowledge helps get you where you need to go!

Dave
