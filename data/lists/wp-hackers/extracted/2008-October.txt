It appears that the upload folder setting is parsed relative to  
ABSPATH, rather than web root.  So, if I move wp-content out of the wp  
folder, it's then impossible to set the uploads folder to be in wp- 
content...?

Site is at example.com, but WP files are at example.com/wp.

Contents folder is example.com/wp-content.

Setting uploads folder to wp-content/uploads, that ends up pointing to  
example.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/.  I want it to point to example.com/ 
wp-content/uploads/ instead....

We've abstracted everything else so that people can move everything  
custom (wp-content, wp-config.php) out of the folder with the actual  
WP files (which makes updates soooooo much better thanks).  It appears  
we need to do the same for the uploads folder.

I don't see any problem with leaving the uploads folder relative to
root, since it is an explicit setting that the user can specify. In
the settings page, it states that the default is wp-content/uploads,
which is a ABSPATH relative path.

I mean, what if you want the upload folder to be at
example.com/wp/uploads/ instead? That's not relative to the wp-content
folder.

If you want it to be in wp-content and you move wp-content, then you
need to move the upload folder location as well. It's already custom,
we don't need to make it confusingly custom.

Message-ID: <EE54E3C6-42CA-47C8-B2A3-825DEC216239@mit.edu>

Hi All,

I'm writing a WP plugin that adds a new collapsible box of options to  
the Post/Page entry forms. Within this box, I would like to have  
tabbed sub-pages exactly like what you see in the "Categories" box  
right now (with "All Categories" and "Most Used" being the two sub- 
pages of that box).

It appears that the CSS & JavaScript code that supports the tabs in  
the Categories box is hard-coded specifically for that box instead of  
generalized for anyone who wants tabbed content in an administrative  
panel. Is this true? Is there any way to re-use Wordpresses existing  
tab magic, or do I have to duplicate the functionality with a second  
set of JavaScript?

Thanks very much in advance,
Ted

Actually, all that extra code is special cases for the category
handling and such. To make tabs there's only one line of javascript to
do it:
var categoryTabs = jQuery('#category-tabs').tabs();

That's literally it. jQuery makes it easy.

jQuery's tabs method basically takes the ID of a UL, and makes each LI
element in it into those tabs. The LI elements contain A links to DIVs
holding the content of the tabs, and the name of the links is used for
the names of the tabs.

Here's the category tabs UL:
<ul id="category-tabs">
	<li class="ui-tabs-selected"><a href="#categories-all"
tabindex="3"><?php _e( 'All Categories' ); ?></a></li>
	<li class="hide-if-no-js"><a href="#categories-pop"
tabindex="3"><?php _e( 'Most Used' ); ?></a></li>
</ul>

As you can see, it has the LI's with the links in it, and those links
name a couple of DIVs: #categories-all and #categories-pop. Here's
those DIVs, right below that. Note how one of them defaults to
"display:none", so that it doesn't show up. Only the default tab
should show up, by default. The jQuery javascript manipulates the
display setting to show the tabs as needed.
<div id="categories-pop" class="ui-tabs-panel" style="display: none;">
	<ul id="categorychecklist-pop" class="categorychecklist form-no-clear" >
		<?php $popular_ids = wp_popular_terms_checklist('category'); ?>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="categories-all" class="ui-tabs-panel">
	<ul id="categorychecklist" class="list:category categorychecklist
form-no-clear">
		<?php wp_category_checklist($post->ID, false, false, $popular_ids) ?>
	</ul>
</div>

That is pretty much all there is to creating working Tabs.

Otto,

Fantastic!

Also worth noting is that for that stuff to work, the jquery-ui-tabs
script must be enqueued. For the Post editor, it's already there,
however it's not enqueued for the Page editor by default since it
doesn't have anything that uses tabs. So make sure to do a
wp_enqueue_script('jquery-ui-tabs'); somewhere and hook that to
admin-head when the page.php is called. I'm unsure of the right way to
hook that in there.

It would be nice if it called something like ".tabs" rather than 
"#category-tabs" so that additional meta boxes could use tabs and they'd 
automatically work.  It's not a big deal to add in the extra JS, I just 
think it would be nicer if you didn't have to.

It's NOT relative to the web root, that's the problem.  It's relative  
to ABSPATH.

If my WordPress files are at example.com/wp. then I MUST put the  
uploads folder somewhere within the wp/ directory.  I can't do  
example.com/uploads, for example.

Okay, I see.  I wasn't registering that I could set a hard server  
path.  I guess that works.

In line with other such settings, could we add the ability to set  
WP_UPLOADS_DIR in wp-config.php?

I like these constants in particular because they help me with testing  
-- On my local test copy of the site I can use a copy of the live  
database and just override to local test paths.  There are other uses  
as well.

I don't see how that would help much, as the URL would still be wrong
for the uploaded images and such in the posts themselves.

Anyway, if you want to override the upload directory, just stick a
filter on upload_dir. It gets an array of URLs and paths and
everything related to that.

Okay, so we add WP_UPLOADS_URL also.  And/or WP can figure it out  
automatically by subtracting the web root from WP_UPLOADS_DIR

Which doesn't work in the example I described -- copying the live  
database to a test setup.  If I have to activate different plugins it  
complicates things.

A CONSTANT override for the uploads folder is every bit as useful as  
an override for wp-content, which we already have.  :)

I'm relatively new to things such as SVN and making patches.  I have a  
question:

If I want to make a patch and submit it to Trac, should I make the  
changes to the latest stable release and diff that, or change a recent  
nightly and diff that?  Is there a preferred way or maybe it doesn't  
matter?

The changes won't go into the latest stable, they'll most likely go into 
trunk (2.7), so the diff should be made from that. If they ARE going 
into the current release (in this case, 2.6.x), then the diff should be 
made from that branch (branches/2.6) rather than a stable tag.

Once something it tagged, it doesn't change. As for knowing where your 
patch will be applied, almost everything will go to trunk. The only 
things that will go to the current branch are security fixes and bug 
fixes (if they are important enough).

Hope that helps.

Still doesn't help, the URL is hard-coded in the post. You'd need to
add a filter to the_content and search/replace the URL.

Finally, a use for the my-hacks.php file!

If you have enabled my-hacks support, then you can put anything you
like in that file and it'll load just before every plugin. No need to
enable squat.

I disagree, it just makes things harder for plugin developers, and to
no real benefit for anybody else.

Wait... So if I have a blog for a while, and then change the uploads  
directory in Settings, the existing media in posts retains the old  
location???

That seems really off to me.

Duly noted.  That may actually fix a totally different issue I've  
had. :)

Is that support relatively stable, or is it deprecated?  The word  
"legacy" sounds like "deprecated" to my ear.

Why harder?  If wp_upload_dir() accounts for the change, it should be  
no difference to plugin authors using that function.

Well, if just changing the setting moved a big ton of files, I'd
consider that problematic too.

Basically, it's a problem without a particularly good solution... I've
thought of a couple of ways (like sticking an attachment shortcode
into the post instead of an IMG link), but they all have drawbacks.

Deprecated, but it's been there a long time and I haven't seen anybody
lobbying to remove it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Admin skinning
Message-ID: <3AEF7004-3A2F-47DE-B3EB-DACCB9CC369F@striderweb.com>

There was talk a couple weeks ago in which a lot of people seemed to  
like the idea of being able to "skin" the admin area.  This especially  
in light of varying regard for the sidebar menus (personally I'm on  
the fence -- they may grow on me...).

Somebody in the course of that mentioned that you can basically do  
this already using the "Admin Color Scheme" functionality, since that  
basically just links a CSS file, and there's 90% of skinning right  
there.

So I was thinking -- maybe we should change the label from "Admin  
Color Scheme" to "Admin Skin" (or "Appearance", or "Theme" or  
whatever).  Thus more conducive to entries that change more than just  
colors.

This is a simple change, as we need only change the label, not any code.

Hi everyone. Most of you don't know who I am (long-time listener,  
first-time caller, etc), but I work for Automattic doing user  
experience stuff. I worked on the usability testing and crazyhorse  
prototype over the summer before coming on full-time, and have been  
following the threads related to crazyhorse/2.7 with great interest.  
I just posted a PDF with some wireframes over on the wordpress.org,  
for anyone who is interested.

I posted them with the hope that seeing what we're working toward  
will help with some of the feelings people have expressed about not  
knowing the final design. To that end, the wireframes will and won't  
help. They outline the basic structural goals, and some layout  
niceties that haven't been implemented yet, but they don't include  
any visual/graphic design, as that is being worked on currently. When  
we have pretty visuals to show, we will.

I've been doing 2.7 previews at events like BlogWorld Expo and  
WordCamp, and so far the response has been overwhelmingly positive. I  
know that there are some people on this list who aren't feeling it  
(as one poster so eloquently put it), so I hope the wireframes will  
help illuminate what we're planning. And if you still just don't like  
it, well, please try to at least be nice when you flame me. :)

The wireframes are posted here: http://wordpress.org/development/ 
2008/10/wordpress-27-wireframes/

Thanks,
Jane Wells

P.S. The menus were not decided by the navigation poll. The poll  
helped us get an idea of what people preferred and how they thought  
about the functions in the admin panel, and some respondents made  
great suggestions. We take in everyone's opinion, but the final  
decisions aren't being made by the "committee" of 4000 respondents,  
but by the core dev team.

I don't want to sound negative about admin skinning in general, but
you can also always alter the CSS (or JS) of any site within your
browser (well, in Firefox anyway) using plugins like Stylish and
Greasemonkey. Lorelle pointed out a great example of this that changes
the functionality of the comment editing page, but the principle could
work for any change you wanted to make. Altering it in this way would
also leave your site alone and safe and limit mandatory maintenance.
You also wouldn't have to worry about browser compatibility as you'd
just see the (oh so awful) standard interface when you were away from
your main browser.

Unfortunately userstyles.org seems to be horribly parked at godaddy
right now so I can't check if there are already wp admin mods posted
there, and userscripts.org seems to be using the same search algorithm
as the wp plugin directory (
http://userscripts.org/scripts/search?q=wordpress ) so you'll have to
hunt around to find existing examples.

Just curious if anyone could give some insight on how add_users_page()  
will work in 2.7?  Specifically, where is it going to add these sub- 
pages?  Given how the navigation is now laid out on the sidebar, I  
don't really see where it would go, seeing as how there is no  
"Profile" menu item (currently).

We can move it back to top-level if we have to, although I'd rather
avoid adding another top-level.  Can you point out some example
plugins so we can see what they're adding to Users?

Well, sure, but by that standard, why do we have the "Color Scheme"  
setting at all?

All I was suggesting was a changed label.

As I said -- I don't find anything terrible about the new interface.   
(I use Ozh menus in 2.6 because it reduced click-and-wait massively,  
but in 2.7 that problem is largely alleviated.)  I just think that as  
long as the functionality is there, we should give it a name more  
appropriate to its actual potential use.

Though now that you mention it, it would be nice if that setting also  
allowed the attachment of JavaScript.  Then things such as Ozh Menus  
or Fluency could be turned on and off on a per-user basis according to  
personal preference.

Ryan --

You're probably on wp-testers, but this falls right into a thread I  
started on that list:

http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-testers/2008-October/008927.html

In short -- the top level menus are becoming so specialized it's  
reducing flexibility, and will cause problems if we're not careful.

Oh man, I didn't want to reply to that first one at the risk of being
repetitive, but for wp sites with lots of users there are a lot of
things that make sense to go under 'Profile'. We use it for uploading
avatars, for defining custom content that would overload the user
profile page, it's useful for showing per-user stats etc.

+1 for moving back to top level if at all possible, having it under
settings makes *no* sense to me. Users just aren't a setting, a
'users' item under 'settings' should be settings related to users like
maybe roles or something. The user listing and management really
belongs elsewhere.

Sure can.

WP Super Edit 2.0.3 can put a profile area for user defined  
configurations.  Only if the WP Super Edit option under  "Settings"   
is set to "Individual User Editor Settings" .

In 2.6.2 this shows up under Users. In an earlier version of  trunk  
( 2.7 ) it added a link to the profile area using the $top_submenu  
global. Of course now you just have to know the URL to get there ;)

Personally, I think admin theming is a great opportunity, and should be
supported and named appropriately. Larger organizations installing WordPress
would certainly appreciate the option to skin their admin to fit their
corporate structure.
Just my 2 cents, as a designer.

I really don't see Firefox extensions as a proper way to alter the
admin skin in the long term. And as such, it is of no use to blog
designers.

Adobe did just that with Lightroom, by allowing photographers to
replace the app's logo with their studio's own. That might be a first
step in letting designers and resellers of WP installs taylor-build
WP...

A lot of these plugins looks like they are adding stuff that would
ideally be a tab within the profile.  Regardless, we'll restore the
Users top-level for 2.7 and figure out a better way for 2.8.  I think
a tab-able profile would be nice way of aggregating the per-user
settings that are getting dumped into submenus right now.

Using WP as a platform base to build apps on is something that I see a  
lot of potential in.  Since a theme combines all of the power of  
plugins with a UI layer, it makes it easy to deploy/ship as well.   
Installing your app would be as easy as enabling a new theme in WP.   
WP + Custom Theme = New Application.

There's a lot of potential in there.

The Swim Team Management plugin (http://wp-swimteam.sourceforge.net) I
have been developing currently adds a menu under the Users menu.
There is a lot of information to collect to run a swim team and the
user's view of the Dashboard was the easiest place to capture it.

I was creating my own top level menu but it became cluttered as I
added more functionality so I moved all of the End User facing stuff
to a menu called 'Swim Team' under Users and the administrative
actions to a menu called 'Swim Team' under Management and implemented
a new tabbed interface for each type of user action.

When I took a look at the 2.7 trunk a few weeks back I wondered where
my End User stuff ended up.  It is buried and isn't as obvious as it
was under the Users menu so eliminating this menu may require me to go
back and add my own top level menu (which the Codex implies as not a
good thing to do).

+1 for an extendible user profile area. It will be fantastic to  
separate those user specific settings without menu clutter. If it's  
part of the profile then it will be easier to explain that the setting  
is just for you (the current user), and has nothing to do with anyone  
else.

If it was something that a user would change or modify often a  
developer could choose to place it into a more visible area, that's  
easy enough. It MAY also be a useful place for some particular role  
and capability specific settings. Thanks for looking at this!

Stephane,

+1 to using WP as a web framework.

Though here's the unique part about WP: Most frameworks serve a single  
application at a time, but most WP users have a handful of plugins  
active at once. The fact that the WP API is sufficiently robust and  
complete to make that work well, while also allowing development of  
sophisticated plugins that add significant new features is the truly  
amazing part. </ fanboy moment>

Scriblio, my WordPress as library catalog system, started out by  
completely highjacking a lot of WP functionality. I've learned a lot  
since my first release a few years ago, but the biggest lesson has  
been to make my plugins well behaved and leave plenty of room for  
other well behaved plugins to interoperate with them.

Hey all,

Does anyone have any experience with using MySQL Proxy as a clustered  
DB backend for WP?
http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Proxy

We're using it quite successfully for other apps, but we're wondering  
if anyone has any experience they'd like to share before we dive in  
trying it out for a WP farm.

Also, I can't seem to remember what wordpress.com uses for DB  
clustering/replication.
I could have sworn Matt had mentioned something of the kind on the  
list a few months ago, but I can't seem to craft a query that returns  
the results I'm looking for...

Thx,

Stephane

wp.com used Hyper-DB from what I recall.

Yes, we are using HyperDB on WP.com and quite a few other large MU  
installs are using it as well with great success.  Since all of the  
failover is in the code, you don't have to worry about setting up,  
maintaining, and scaling another piece of the puzzle (MySQL Proxy for  
example).

Page 13, Collapsible Navigation Column

This feature would significantly reduce the dislike I have for the  
left sidebar navigation: wasted horizontal space.

That said, you could probably get better performance from using MySQL 
Proxy, since it a binary and not PHP. It would be interesting to see 
whether that is the case. In theory, MySQL Proxy should be faster or at 
least no slower. You might benefit more if you had a lot of MySQL servers.

Sure, but my using a proxy you are introducing another layer and all  
the overhead associated with it.   A wise man once told me that if  
introducing another layer did not result in at least one order of  
magnitude performance improvement it probably wasn't worth doing.  It  
would be interesting to see some benchmarks....

While I don't think the specific implementation is worthy, bbPress 
offers a tabbed profile that could offer, at least, some architectural 
inspiration.

I guess I should have posted that on wp-hackers instead?

I'm sorry to cross-post, but I think this is important, and I think  
it's the kind of thing that a lot of people are seeing.  I'm seeing a  
lot of comments that sort of glance around this, but nobody's quite  
struck at the core of the problem.

Originally posted on wp-testers:

It seems that the menus in 2.7 are becoming _extremely_ splintered.   
Do we really need ELEVEN menus???

By breaking things out so much, I think we're making the layout more  
"brittle" -- less open to changes or additions.  Write/Manage was a  
much stronger setup than Posts/Pages/Links/Media.  Especially as  
plugins add abilities to the system, authors are going to end up  
having to make more top-level menus because we're losing the more  
generalized topics such as "write" and "manage".  Either that or we're  
all going to have a thousand things all crammed under "tools" because  
that's going to be the only logical place left....

	"Hmmm... I used the have the calendar page under 'Manage'.  Huh.  I  
guess.... Tools?"

	"Well, is the 'top of every page' notice (from plugin x) a page or  
post?  Neither, really.  It used to be under Write.  Guess I have to  
stick it under Tools...?"

That was two good examples just off the top of my head.  We're  
removing much of the flexibility of the interface by making Top Level  
menus so specialized.

As much as I appreciate feedback, I think designing this via poll is  
going to give us the proverbial "horse made by a committee".  The  
geeks in charge (in which I, some tiny bit, include myself) need to  
have a longer view of things.

We can't overlook this, guys, or we're going to end up having to do  
_another_ redesign two months from now when all these issues come out  
in real-world use.

I think we should really rethink the re-menuing of 2.7  The 2.6 menus  
were very flexible and left a lot of room for any kind of expansion.

My whole thought or opinion on this is, from earlier versions on up to 
2.7 here, there's been quite a few changes on the backend, and the 
structuring here and there. Do you really want to have the menus 
structured differently throughout various releases or what-not?

IMHO, I think it would be best, to minimize the structuring and keep it 
all at a set structure system. One that makes sense and keeps everyone 
happy. Then, use that same structuring system throughout almost all 
versions. Of course, there's the horiztonal and now vertical menu, but 
think about it from the point of view from Plugin authors and so forth.

You're going to end up having to have plugins and or admin themes (if 
that becomes another big fad in the future), needing to be compatible 
with various versions of WordPress from here on out. I guess I'm looking 
at this from the point of view of the "future" for WordPress. You'll end 
up having to have, themes or plugins for this version, that version, 
this other version, and possible future versions.

If "we" get a good system / menu structure that makes sense down pat, 
adjust all other versions around that system then. Even if they're 
horizontal or vertical. I'm not suggesting to take 2.6 horizontal menus, 
and make them vertical like 2.7's. I'm saying, some how maybe get all 
the menus working on the same similar structure or whatever.

It would keep the workload for plugin authors and possible back-end 
theme authors down alot. They wouldn't have to duplicate their themes or 
plugins to suit or fit, for so many various versions and what-not... 
Maybe this is asking for alot, I'm not sure? Maybe it's just impossible 
too, but just wanted to share my views on this...

I guess I'd rather just see WordPress grow stronger and faster, without 
all these possible little bumps and stuff in the roadway ahead. Example 
below, it's not intended to be taken literally, just example of what I'd 
hate to see happening though...

2.5 - Need to code stuff for this version. Make plugins / themes for 
just this version.
2.6 - Need to code same stuff again, for just this version. Make dupes 
of plugins / themes for just this version.
2.7 - Need to code same stuff AGAIN, for just this version. Make dupes 
of plugins / themes for just this version alone.
2.8 - Need to code same stuff ANOTHER TIME, just for this version. Make 
dupes of plugins / themes for just this version alone.

And this too, confusing much? Yes! Haha. Wow, it's like rearranging 
things in a senile old person's house, while they slept. It might be 
funny to watch them wake up and be totally lost, but for them, it's not 
so funny. It's having to learn where everything is all over again... Not 
to mention more complex for everything and everyone for structure(s).

And come to think of it, I wouldn't mind having a section below "Settings"
called "Plugin Settings". That way I can have either open without opening
the other (I have a lotta plugins).

The nice thing IMO about the "splintered" menus is that you can show and
hide exactly what you want to see and don't want to see since it remembers
your preference in a cookie.

Recall that 2.6 has 8. It's less noticeable that there are that many
due to the visual design.   The visual design for 2.7 will make the
different sets of menus distinct, with emphasis going to the object
menus.

Write/Manage created lots of problems during user testing.  It has
long been a complaint that is now being remedied.  Jane will reply
with more details on that.

I'd rather have stuff crammed under Tools than crammed under Manage
with the stuff I actually care about.  The Manage menu was getting out
of hand even without plugins piling on.  I've seen Manage menus with a
couple dozen submenus.  You have to look at all of that clutter when
you want to edit a post.  Not good.

>        "Hmmm... I used the have the calendar page under 'Manage'.  Huh.  I
> guess.... Tools?"

Yes.  Unless it is related to one of our objects it should go into
Tools.   Why should it be located next to actual content creation and
editing?  If it really is meta related to posts, it should go within
the Posts menu where the other meta data for posts resides, for
example.  Otherwise, off to Tools it goes.

>        "Well, is the 'top of every page' notice (from plugin x) a page or
> post?  Neither, really.  It used to be under Write.  Guess I have to stick

Not sure what you mean.  A notice needs a menu?

Retaining big buckets in which to dump for the convenience of plugins
is not a compelling reason to stick with the flawed Write/Manage
split.

My intent is to add new menu API for adding pages to the new object
menus.  add_posts_page(), add_pages_page(), add_links_page(), and
add_media_page().  Also, add_object_page() will allow adding a new
top-level object menu that is grouped with the other objects.  Notice
also the bump out in the Media menu (see wireframes).  That will
accommodate adding new media types such as polls, slideshows, etc.
Tools will be there for everything else, which I think is appropriate.
 If it is not content being published or metadata for that content, it
should get out of the way.

Message-ID: <48E5E6FF.6080705@konstruktors.com>

Hello everyone,

What about allowing everyone to name and sort the main menu?

Here is a working prototype:
http://konstruktors.com/examples/wordpress-dashboard/05/

List of features:

* Select 'Customize Menu' to enable editing/sorting.
* Click on top-level menu text to edit the label.
* Click on top-level menu *outside* the label (on the arrow, for
example) text to collapse/expand menu.
* Drag-and-drop any of the menu items, even from one top-level item to
other.

What do you think?

Regards,
Kaspars

p.s. I couldn't find a way to disable href action for top-level links
when editing is enabled. As far as I know, it could be accomplished by
adding return false; to a click even.

Sorting, perhaps. I don't really see the benefit to renaming though.  
I'm not sure many people would actually bother to rename the titles of  
the sidebar menu. Ordering is quite handy though. :)

I think it might be better, however, to not have a toggle for turning  
sorting on or off-- if a user drags a menu item, it should move  
without having to be told it's about to be moved (if you know what I  
mean).

Just my two cents, nice prototype (small bug: when you start dragging  
a menu item and you drag it far enough that some items rearrange, but  
then you drag it back to its original spot and drop it [ie, no move],  
then click on it to rename, the menu item disappears-- otherwise,  
works fine). :)

I think that menus, labels and naming strategy have been the hottest
topics on wp-hackers for the past month :)

+1 to reordering/sorting. Users can order as they please. Couldn't hurt,
could only help (I guess).

-1 to renaming. Adds non-needed complexity (both code and interface, do we
do it per user or what, etc.), can be a pain to support ("but I don't have a
settings menu!"), and so forth.

Hey Matt,

There are certain limitations in the current jQuery sortable extension
which could make the expand/collapse event a bit unstable and sluggish
because of the shared onclick event.

Yeah, I am aware of those. Adding custom helper and placeholder
classnames to target li items could probably make it smoother.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.

I agree. Considering the extent of the existing user base, the ease of  
instal and widespread support in hosting companies, the strength of  
the API and so on, it has become my rapid development framework of  
choice.

Thanks for the feedback. I'll start working on a presentation to be  
released in the near future.

Hi all, I'm a newbie to the list - a silent observer and a huge fan of WordPress.

Myself (wp-hive.com) and a  good friend (blogallo.com) will be there.

Been looking forward to this for a long time. Can't wait to meet everyone.

-1 for renaming as a core feature. It should be possible with a plugin
but putting it there by default will just create a mess where plugin
authors don't know what the name of the heading will be that their
plugin page is under. Any changes to the labels definitely have to
function across the whole site and not be on a user by user basis or
you end up with support problems as previously stated.

Message-ID: <633F6C11-D882-4348-957D-A5E9172E1092@automattic.com>

Hi guys. I'll try to respond to the main things I've seen brought up  
on the list over the last couple of days.

As Ryan mentioned, a lot of people had trouble with the Write/Manage  
dichotomy, mainly because editing a post that had been saved or  
published was a confusing thing: were they writing or managing?  
Technically they're writing, but they're also managing. A lot of  
people also found themselves writing Pages instead of Posts  
accidentally because of the menu structure. And though the top menu  
only had a few main buckets, the submenus were long. When we did the  
testing over the summer and had people complete various tasks in the  
admin panel, things that were located under the Manage menu further  
to the right were often problematic, because having such a long  
horizontal list made people gloss right over the menu items they  
should have used. They knew the items were there, because they had  
used them successfully in the past. And since we were using eye  
tracking during these sessions, we could tell that users were looking  
right at them and not registering them, kind of like you look at ads  
without paying attention.

When we did the usability testing over the summer, it became clear  
that the way many users think about using their blog is by content  
type, which is why the Crazyhorse prototype groups all the content  
types under a Content label. From there, we got feedback that most  
people don't think about "content," but about making posts or adding  
links or checking comments. "Splintering" the menu into the content  
types was done in response to the way average users think abut using  
their admin tool. When Liz Danzico and I originally lumped them all  
under one Content section in Crazyhorse, it made perfect sense to us,  
because we work in the industry and we think about things like  
content. So do many people on this list. But do your moms or brothers  
or kids? 2.7 is an attempt to make the interface relate more to how  
the average user thinks of things.

The number of menu items (again, mentioned by Ryan) on the current  
admin is 8 main categories, plus links in different header locations  
for dashboard, help, forums, and support (on .com). That's 11 or 12.  
It doesn't seem like that many because of the nice design  
differentiation that Happy Cog used so that it wouldn't seem like an  
overwhelming number of items. 2.7 will get a similarly nice  
treatment. At the same time, we're putting most navigation in the  
same general location so that people don't have to look around for  
things. To refer to the eye tracking again, those small header links,  
and even the links to the right for settings and users, were often  
overlooked even when they were seen. The current version of 2.7 has  
not been styled in any way, so it's no surprise that it looks clunky.  
When the admin has been styled and the navigation groups are treated  
differently visually, and they have their cute little icons in  
preparation for the collapsible column, it's going to be great (or at  
least *I* think so; YMMV).

There are two fundamental opinions about navigation here: start with  
a few menus and have deeper/broader subs, or have more main menus,  
with shallower paths and fewer subs. We are basically switching from  
the former to the latter to try and address some of the problems  
people have had with findability, but again, the switch from write/ 
manage to posts/links/media etc isn't really adding a bunch more  
navigation in terms of number of top level links, they're just  
grouped differently.

Re: Tools vs. Manage as a dumping ground. Personally, I think Tools  
is way cooler. Tools > Code Monkey, Manage > TPS reports. We talked  
about having a Plugin Settings under the Plugins menu, but there was  
some question as to whether people would want to put them there. I  
think it would be an ideal location, so if people are into that  
suggestion by Alex, let us know.

Re: Users menu. In response to the feedback on this list, we're  
putting the Users menu on the top level and leaving it alone for 2.7.  
However, we do want to consolidate it into Settings ultimately, and  
Ryan's point about a tabbed profile page is something I think would  
work well. For individual users, they can still get to their profile  
screen in one click from the Howdy Username link at the top of the  
screen. By putting off a change to the placement of the Users menu,  
we're trying to accommodate Plugin authors, and hopefully we can all  
work together on a more gradual transition for that profile-attached  
stuff.

Re: "Wasted space" in the left navigation column. If you look at the  
amount of space currently taken up by the header and the navigation  
horizontally and compare it with the space taken up in 2.7 (well,  
when 2.7 is styled, anyway), it is significantly less, given that  
most monitors/laptop screens are wider than they are tall, and many  
people's browser windows have similar ratios. One of the main reasons  
we went with left hand navigation was to try and use less space for  
the non-working area.

Re: Separating comments and pings. Splintering the counts isn't  
included in 2.7, but on the Comments screen you can now filter by  
comments, trackbacks or pingbacks, which is at least a step in that  
direction. Hopefully we can do more around this in 2.8.

Re: Public beta. That's basically the month before launch, after  
freeze. I think Ryan said it was October 13 for 2.7?

I'll be at WordCamp Toronto on Saturday and WordCamp NYC on Sunday if  
anyone wants to vent about these things in person. :)

P.S. Why don't more people trim their posts on this list? Just  
curious, because it's a pain to follow on a mobile device with all  
those fully-included emails.

Lots of good explanation here. The fact that the 'content' menus will
be styled differently is certainly interesting, I'm very curious to
see where that goes.

Thank you for the users menu. I think it will remain useful for meta
"tools" that apply to authors within the social networking scope of
the site in terms of just their user accounts.

The answer is probably Gmail, which does such a good job of organizing
email for people that they stop doing it themselves.

Thanks you for this -- this is the first solid response I've seen that  
amounts to more than "just trust us".

Something to also point out here is the off-and-on discussion of  
WordPress as a "full CMS".  Regardless of its full capability, people  
will always tend to see it as "blog software" so long as the interface  
stresses blog aspects so much.

Perhaps the community is perfectly fine with that -- I certainly use  
it for blogging -- but it's worth pointing out.

A while back I asked about this topic, and got some irritated  
responses along the line of "It _is_ a CMS!"  What I was asking about  
was how to remove or hide the overtly "bloggy" aspects of the  
interface.  For example:  What if I don't want a Posts section at all,  
just Pages?  Can't be done -- at least not easily.

If it looks like a dog and quacks like a duck, it's a quacking dog,  
not a duck. ;p  WordPress isn't a CMS so much as a blog program that,  
oh by the way, you could probably use as a CMS if you wanted to.  That  
may end up a detriment in the long term.

Again, thanks for that.  People kept saying there are eight menus, and  
my first thought was  "These people can't count"

Speaking of which, I never did receive your TPS report.  I'll get you  
another copy.

Manage --> Tools didn't bother nearly as much as losing "Write".   
Here's a thought though -- part of the confusion was probably in the  
way that clicking on "Write took you to a write screen, so people just  
started writing.  Also, depending on what screen you were on, clicking  
Write or Manage took you different places -- VERY confusing.

With the new navigation, clicking on Write opens the submenu, but  
doesn't take you to a different screen.  I think that from that alone  
the distinction will be a lot clearer.  Click Write, and then you are  
forced to look and chose _what_ you want to write.

Did you test it that way and were people still confused by it?

I'm against this in the ***strongest possible terms***.  Please read...

<http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/06/on-plugin-design/>

Excerpt:
My take on this is quite simple: From the user perspective, plugins  
should be invisible. That is, the fact that such-and-such part of the  
interface was made by a plugin should be invisible. The best design  
for a plugin is to seamlessly blend into the existing interface so  
that someone who didn't already know would not realize that that thing  
there is not part of the basic system.

Personally, I use Ozh's Drop Down Menus plugin, and I'm not quite sure  
why we're not integrating something like this into Core.  This is  
***so much more like a desktop app***, and it saves a massive amount  
of a) room, and b) clicks.  It's outstanding.

I always try to do so.  I'm always amused when I find a bunch of  
stacked WordPress list footers at the bottom of an email. ;)

Here's that link again regarding "dumping grounds".  Please do read it.

I think I slightly misunderstood what you were saying.  Either way, a  
clarification:

There are a lot of plugins that have very minor settings, or  
(especially) are set-and-forget, such as Akismet.  for these, a  
"consolidated" page with settings for multiple plugins would actually  
be a pretty cool idea.  This would drastically reduce the clutter  
caused by plugins.

However, I have what I think is an even better idea:

It would be _great_ to give plugin authors a way of adding a settings  
screen that does _not_ show up in the menus at all.  I'm sure a whole  
bunch of people just said, "If it's not in the menus, how are people  
supposed to find it?"

Answer:  Give that plugin a "Configure" link in the Actions column of  
the Manage Plugins screen.  Again, this would be GREAT for plugins  
that you set once and then never look at again.  There's no reason for  
Akismet to permanently eat up menu real estate.

Here's an example of what I'm talking about (scroll down a bit for an  
image):

I've usually done it the other way  - writing a post when I meant to
write a page.

But it will mean a learning curve for current users, and I can
guarantee now that a good proportion of them won't like it.

Any chance of asking someone really really nicely to add a span around
the word 'Howdy' It can then at least be hidden easily via CSS for
those that don't like it.

The current design doesn't work as a lot of people have to scroll up
and down, anything that stops that is a plus. However all this talk
about the menu does make be wonder if it will be keyboard accessible
or not. I really hope it is...

You sound like you've been around a bit (erm, in a nice way?). The
longer people have been around the more likely they are to snip, and
reply at the bottom. But it's a whole can of worms which I'll try and
stay away from (and probably fail).

Sound in principal, but I for one would tend to look at the settings
section first and then go to the plugins page.

Have a general settings page 'which by default has very little on it'
but allows plugin authors to add sections to it. Single tabbed page
perhaps? that way all the small plugins that only require one or two
settings could be added in there, and the larger ones can still add a
new unique settings page.

To me the best plugins are designed in such a way that, once  
activated, you would never know that functionality is coming from a  
plugin.  For the "set and forget" plugins, a sectioned "Plugin  
Settings" page as you describe would be a great idea, but plugins with  
more significant settings pages should not be relegated to that area.   
If the setting has enough settings that it needs its own tab, it's  
probably best served with its own page.

Virtually every plugin has (at least) a slight learning curve.   
Shoving all settings under the Plugins section is handy the first time  
you turn it on and look for settings; but in the long run, plugins  
with which you interact directly are best located in the context  
wherein that _functionality_ makes sense.  Stashing it all under  
Plugins is thinking from the coding side of things.  Putting it in the  
proper GUI context is thinking from the user end of things.

Putting it another way  -- If someone sets up your blog program for  
you (you being a relative n00b) it makes more sense to find that page  
under "Tools" or whatnot than to have to remember that, no, that comes  
from a plugin and is stashed under Plugins.  Where would that page be  
in the menu **if it were part of Core**?  That's where it should go.

Regards,
Stephen

If there is a 'Settings' top level then I would expect plugins that
need a full page to create a full page under that settings menu.
Whether your bulk standard user thinks that is perhaps another thing.

agreed. maybe there should be the possibility of adding a link to a
settings page, no matter where the actual settings page is located?
(or was that what was actually suggested?)

If you saying that plugin settings page should go in the plugins
section then I agree.

exactly, plugin created admin pages should generally be added to the
correct section. Unless there are times when a new top level menu item
is required whereby most pages for that plugin should then go in that
newly created section.

Sometimes trying to find the newly created page or section from a
plugin isn't as intuitive as it should be. A recent one I installed
was added to the Dashboard. Perhaps if I'd read things more closely
I'd have seen the subtle hint, but my brain decided that the manage
section was better for it (or even settings).

+1 - I agree 100% with Stephen on this subject.  Some plugins require
quite a bit of end user interaction from setttings, to management, to
presentation.  The ability to do this is one of the things which
attracted me to WordPress as a development platform.  It provided me
80% of what I needed, I found existing plugins for another 5%, and it
allowed me the hooks to code the remaining things I need.  My end
users don't need to know and probaly don't care which part is core
WordPress, which part is a plugin, and which part is custom
developed.  They just want it to work and to find information where
the UI logically leads them.  I really don't want to end up with a
system where you "manage some things here and other things there" and
"change these settings here and those settings there".

Hi Jane,

Thank you for giving such an in depth look into how the new UI came
about. I think that a lot of developers have been waiting for something
like this -- something which explains how different parts of the 'new'
UI were composed and tested and why you (and Automattic) think it is
better than some of the many suggestions that people have expressed.

Like Stephen Rider said -- "this is the first solid response I've seen
that amounts to more than "just trust us"."

> As Ryan mentioned, a lot of people had trouble with the Write/Manage
> dichotomy, mainly because editing a post that had been saved or
> published was a confusing thing: were they writing or managing?

It would be *very* interesting to know what population of the test group
could not understand if managing means editing or creating. Probably
Create/Manage would have been less confusing for them.

This is clearly because of the < 2.5 navigation where the second level
looks more like an inline text not as a row of navigation items with
equal importance.

Did they try something like Ozh's drop-down menu?

This definitely is reasonable. The question is -- why wouldn't it work
as a drop-down (I know it is already decided for 2.7, but I would really
like to know your thoughts on this).

The way it looks and feels in wireframes is really great.

Compared to the Create/Manage change this (moving User under Settings)
would be really insignificant especially because of username (possibly
with Gravatar) at the top-right.

However I would really like to suggest replacing 'username' with '[G] My
Profile' just because most of the web 'applications' do it that way.

Saying "Howdy, Username" doesn't imply anything about being able to edit
User account or User settings.

Thank you once again, Jane, for getting so much of inside information to
the community.

Best wishes,
Kaspars

p.s. thank you for the lengthy comment on my blog; I'll reply during

The "Plugin Settings" may or may not be the best name for it. My (I'm the
Alex that Jane referred to BTW) suggestion was merely trying to avoid
something like this:

http://files.viper007bond.com/wordpress/settings-pile.png

I normally run 1920x1200 so it's not nearly as bad (two rows), but can you
imagine having all of those vertically laid out? And what if I want to
access General/Writing/Discussion/etc. a lot -- then I have to keep all of
those showing too.

I dunno, UI's really, really aren't my thing so there's probably a better
solution out there. I'm just brainstorming.

Seems like the uploader script to add a new theme in the Themes directory
*requires* theme authors to have the Alignment/Caption classes in the
style.css file. Not cool.

Is it possible to have the script check for @imports in the style.css? That
would be _super_ awesome.

Reason being is that many clever theme authors like to import all their
styles (which includes the alignment/caption classes too) giving their theme
a greater control over their stylesheets and a lot more extensibility for
the theme in question. It also makes things much more organized and clean
looking in the styles.css file.

It also makes things super slow as the browser now has to individually
load every one of those files when the page is loaded.

Please, stop doing this. It's not clever, and it's a little bit
annoying. A well designed theme should have one and only one CSS file.
It's acceptable to have extra files like that only when you're doing
advanced theme control, like changing header colors and such via the
theme's administration page.

I don't agree, just as I don't agree that all proper C programs ought
to have all of their code in a single .c file with nary a #include to
be found.  CSS is coding, thus modularization and code reuse are just
as valid in its context as they are in Java, PHP, C, et al.

I don't want to include the contents of my reset.css in every stinking
CSS doc that I author.  It's inefficient, it's messy and it leads to
all sorts of nastiness down the road.

Otto, to each his own, but I think that requirement should be handled
differently.

Perhaps have it where the uploader script just warns theme authors in
advance that they should include those extra alignment styles instead?
For the most part, theme authors initially start their themes from the
default theme anyway (which includes those css classes) so it really
shouldn't be a problem right?

Including everything under one css file is probably the best
way--performance wise.. but I think the trade off for being able to modularize
stylesheets and simply organize them are much better alternatives.

It is possible to promote themes that do not comply with what the WordPress
theme's directory requires on your own site.  Just look at the Revolution
themes.  In addition to this, the WordPress theme's directory has only
recently been reopened so I am sure many planned features will come down the
line.  Also @import statements are not 100% browser compatible.
Thanks,
Adam

We're talking about a WordPress theme here, not an desktop application.

While I agree with your general theory on code reuse and
modularization, I'm extremely hard pressed to think of a legitimate
case for this in the very specific context of a WordPress theme. WP
themes are not that complex, in general, nor do they need to be. When
I see a theme with multiple CSS files (or god help me, a "style.php"),
then I'm inclined to think that somebody is trying way, way too hard.

Some kinds of creativity should be suppressed. I don't want my
mechanic getting all creative when fixing my car engine, nor do I want
my plumber getting creative while running my shower lines... And I
don't want my WordPress themes to be all creative about where the
styles go.

I mean, you must have a style.css file, in much the same way that
WordPress requires specific naming for many other files. Does that
also suppress creativity?

I ask somebody, anybody, to present a valid use case for not having
these mandatory styles (and they ARE mandatory, in the sense that your
theme is broken in 2.5 and up if you don't have them) in the style.css
file. There's only about 8 of them, you could stick them at the end of
the style.css file, after your @import lines (which are also, in
themselves, evil) if you wanted to. Why keep them separate? What,
exactly, is the advantage to that? If your theme is worth it's salt,
then those styles are different for each theme anyway, so there's not
going to be a whole lot of code reuse going on.

Which is true in general, really. CSS doesn't see a lot of code reuse
if you're doing it properly. The whole point of moving styling out
into the CSS is that the HTML becomes semantic. You're not supposed to
use "alignright" and "centered" classes in HTML, really, because
you're supposed to define things as what they actually are (post,
title, etc), and let the CSS handle the styling. The only reason we're
using these non-semantic classes in WordPress is that we have to
signal the theme what the users selection was from the editor, in
order to let the theme handle the styling correctly, and these are
easy to understand and deal with.

So if you're defining things semantically in your own themes, there's
not going to be a heck of a lot of code reuse. And if you're using
tricks and hacks for CSS on a regular basis, then you're doing it
wrong anyway, no?

That's just my opinion, of course. Sorry for the mini-rant. :)

No, it's not suppressive.  Mandating that all non-required CSS styles
exist in your single style.css IS suppressive.

Perhaps.  However, many of my themes use styling that is fairly
similar, thus it would be nice to reuse those styles without having to
hand update per-theme.  And let's not forget about Child Themes...

Not true.  Please see Blueprint, YUI, et al. for explicit
contradiction of your statement.

I don't agree.  The class names are certainly named after their
intended layout purpose, but you can put lie to their actual meaning
by, say, defining .alignright's float: property to "left".  The class
names are simply that -- class names.  They're used as a cheap hack at
the moment to allow users some sort of WYSIWYG functionality.

Simply not true. I have a reset.css that I use time and again to reset
all the standard HTML entities' properties back to a base level that
then gives me explicit control over every pad, float, clear, margin,
border, etc.

WP 2.7 introduces better support for child themes so I started developing a
theme framework per say, to serve as the parent theme for all my future
theme releases (which I'm also gpling for others to benefit from). I'm sure
you heard all about child theme benefits I don't to go into that here...

Enter WP Framework <http://code.google.com/p/wpframework/>, a powerful theme
framework that empowers theme authors to create solid, functional WordPress
themes faster than ever!
[/plug]

Let's take a peak at the styles.css:

/* Reset Browser Defaults (css/reset.css) */
@import url(css/reset.css);

/* Base Stylesheet (css/base.css) */
@import url(css/base.css);

/* Site Specific Styles - (css/screen.css) */
@import url(css/screen.css);

/* That's all folks! */
All standards complaint browsers support the @import
rule.<http://webdesign.about.com/cs/css/qt/tipcssatimport.htm> No
hacks involved.

Alignment/caption css classes are clearly declared in the
base.css<http://code.google.com/p/wpframework/source/browse/trunk/css/base.css>
 here<http://code.google.com/p/wpframework/source/browse/trunk/css/base.css#85>and
here<http://code.google.com/p/wpframework/source/browse/trunk/css/base.css#126>
.

This method of including the css is widely used by many wordpress themes,
adopted from many advocators in the web standards world.
In fact, I just attended a talk at Web Master Jam Session 08 where Jina
Bolton, a highly respected css designer discuss this.
BluePrint CSS Framework and many other css frameworks promote this.
At WordCamp Utah, Alex King just introduced his theme framework to the
world, Carrington.

Lets check out the styles.css:

@import url(css/carrington-blog.css);

I could go on. It's not about creativity, it's about given structure and
organization to your code. Some people might only need a reset, or a
sensible typography base, or whatever. How would they go about doing this
without including everything else using the
one-css-file-put-everything-in-here method?

Themes are getting much more advanced (which is a good thing) and so our
stylesheets play a much more important role than ever.

As the person who wrote the upload script I feel some what obligated  
to chime in here :-)

A couple of people have asked about searching for the required classes  
in other CSS files.  This is on my list of features/enhancements to  
look at.  It's not something I'm immediately worried about for a  
couple of reasons, the first of which is that it isn't a show stopper  
for a theme to get uploaded.  I agree that it's inconvenient to have  
to move those classes to style.css if you didn't have them there  
originally.

I expect to have support for checking the other CSS files in the  
upload script, but am not close enough to implementing/testing it yet  
to give a date/time of when it will go in.

Why not just put empty selector blocks in style.css, with a comment 
noting the actual @include file which contains the real, fleshed-out rules?

E.g.:

  style.css
  ----------
  .wp-caption { /* see: gallery.css */ }

  gallery.css
  -----------
  .wp-caption {
     background-color: #eee;
     padding: 6px;
     margin: 0 0 4px 0;
     text-align: center;
     /* ...etc... */
  }

You can customize your li output by registering a callback.  The
callback should not output the closing li tag, the walker will do
that.  With a callback you don't have to do your own loop and you
don't have to handle threading yourself.  Also, I'm think of adding a
separate_comments boolean to comments_template() so themes can
indicate they want comments separated with counts for each type.

wp_list_comments(array('callback' => 'custom_comment'));

function custom_comment($comment, $args, $depth) {
       $GLOBALS['comment'] = $comment;
?>
<li <?php comment_class(); ?> id="comment-<?php comment_ID( ); ?>">
        <?php echo get_avatar( $comment->user_id,
$comment->comment_author_email, 32 ); ?>
        <h4>
                <?php comment_author_link( ); ?>
                <span class="meta"><?php comment_time( ); ?> on <?php
comment_date( ); ?> | <a href="#comment-<?php comment_ID( ); ?>">#</a>
| <?php echo comment_reply_link(array('depth' => $depth, 'max_depth'
=> $args['depth'])) ?><?php edit_comment_link( __( 'e' ),
'&nbsp;|&nbsp;',''); ?></span>
        </h4>
        <?php comment_text( ); ?>

<?php
}

Thanks for the tip Ryan!  I seemed to have overlooked the significance
of the callback argument.  I have updated the how to with this and
removed the foreach loop.

That adds a separate_comments flag to comments_template().  If the
flag is true, comments_template() will setup comments_by_type.  Seem
helpful?  Anything else we should add in?  Maybe counts for each type?

'echo' by default and 'return' with echo=0 if possible, please :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Help understanding the Custom Fields editor
Message-ID: <BF1B603A-8848-4A0C-8732-FE5AFCE7393D@gmail.com>


My jQuery jujitsu my be too weak to understand the answer, but I'm  
trying to create something that works very similarly to the existing  
Custom Fields feature in the post editor. That is, I want ajaxy add,  
update, delete of the fields for data that's part of a plugin I'm  
writing.

The easiest way, it would seem would be to dissect how the Custom  
Fields feature works and leverage as much of that code as possible.  
Thing is: I can't figure out how it works.

I can see POST requests going to admin-ajax.php with action=add-meta,  
but I can't see how those requests are being generated (in fact, grep  
can't find many instances of "add-meta" anywhere in the source). Nor  
do I see anything obviously attaching an action to the submit button  
for that form.

This contrasts with the jQuery bits related to the permalink editor,  
which I can figure out.

Can anybody offer any pointers?

Thank you,

Casey

I'm not sure counts for each type is really required as you could just
count($comments_by_type[$type]) but someone may find it useful.

The counts would be particularly useful in filtering
get_comments_count, but where comments_by_type is being setup is too
late for that hook to work everywhere.

I'll take some time and think about other useful information that
could be added in.

I had that for awhile, but on posts with lots of comments the variable
storing all of that markup eats quite a lot of memory.

:grin:

I'd already seen it and mentioned it - but even you say it is
overkill. Adding a simple <span> around it would make it possible to
be hidden very easily.

Personally it doesn't bother me that much but a client of my other
'alf  hates it. We're in the UK, the client is in the USA.

and sorry, I know its been brought up before...

Hi all:

I'm new of the list but hoping you all will greet me with that legendary
WordPress hospitality. :)

Anyway, watching this dialog I feel compelled to inject my thoughts.

Both sides have solid points:

1.) A dev can greatly improve performance when they minimize the number of
HTTP requests required to load a web page. See #1 on
http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html  Also see "High
Performance Web Sites" (http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529307/) by the
same people.

2.) Packing everything into a single CSS file creates maintenance problems,
and maintenance problems often translate into more than problems for devs,
it can also create problems for users when bugs are not found because of
poorly architected structure.

So rather than act like Republicans and Democrats who only seem to want to
support their own ideology and attack the other sides why not look for a
solution that meets everyone's needs?  

I have a lot of experience with Drupal and one thing Drupal does when the
optimization switch is turned on is it aggregates CSS files into one when
that optimization is turned on.  I don't like how Drupal does it exactly and
I think it could be implemented in a manner that would not require the admin
to even be aware of it but I'd like to posit that maybe WordPress could come
up with a conceptually similar solution albiet w/o the admin burden? 

Such a plan probably couldn't solve immediate needs but might be a nice
addition in a 3.x version of WordPress.  Thoughts?

http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3372 is related to that idea.
The CSS implementation of that would probably work pretty well if all the  
CSS rules were prefixed with page ID's and the JS implementation probably  
needs a bit more work on dependancy and loading orders/etc..

Thanks, I'll check it out.  (Sadly it seems the issue was first presented 2
years ago and still not addressed...)

Why would IDs need to be prefixed, assuming optimization is done on a
per-page basis?

That said, having two (2) CSS files or even three (3) can sometimes be
better than having only one (1), i.e. if one is a large CSS file that's
global for the site and the other is smaller and page specific. I'm assuming
that the first one would be cached so only loaded once.

To really optimize you can use three (3); one (1) that contains everything
needed for the current page and two (2) others that are the global and page
specific ones where the global one is preloaded and then cached using the
same technicals as image preloading as described here:
http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5214317.html  (And
actually when I said three (3) I really meant one (1) global and then one
(1) combined and one (1) page specific CSS where you'd end up with the
latter two (2) for each page on a site.)

Of course the three CSS file optimization adds significant complexity and
could only be viable if somehow built int WP core. FWIW.

Ah yes, Well.. It could be done on a per-page basis, But that would remove  
nearly all gains that'd be achieved, The time it takes for WP to load  
server side, combine all the scripts together, etc, is about the same time  
that it'd take for any decent web server to serve up half a dozen static  
files, and the client should see no speed decrease thanks to HTTP  
Keepalives and Static compression at the server level.

My original idea when implementing that quick plugin was to find out if  
compressing ALL styles would overcome the PHP/WP loading times, as  
hopefully it'd only have to load once a session (You'd add in some extra  
E-tags and caching headers of course)

Thats basically what happens at present, A master stylesheet, and many  
smaller ones for various sections and/or features that are enabled for  
that page.

In the end, I feel it comes down to Server speed, Serving static files is  
FAST, loading PHP and WordPress in comparison, is SLOW, The ammount of ms.  
saved by bundling all the page requests into a single request tends to be  
lost when it comes ot loading everything..

You are presuming it would not be cached on a per page basis, and I assumed
it would be cached.

For point of clarity nothing I was suggesting would preclude static files,
they would just be cached and loaded by PHP.

Additionally, as "High Performance Web Sites"
(http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529307/) points out time spent in server
side PHP pages is rarely ever a bottleneck compared to the time it takes to
get to the browser and the overhead created by lots of HTTP requests.  The
milliseconds lost by calling a PHP file that loads cached CSS based from a
static file named based on the URL of the page that requests it from the
file system would be unnoticable for all but probably the largest 0.1% of
WordPress sites. It would be an almost perfect solution. IMO.

And if someone were really optimistic then using the PHP output buffer the
HTML could be captured, the CSS references rewritten and the resultant HTML
similarly cached which would probably greatly improve performance all
around, albeit that would be a much bigger project.

Anyway, this will be my last comment on this topic. I was just offering a
point of view I hadn't seen discussed but I hadn't intended to get into a
debate black hole. One has to choose his battles and this issue isn't the
battle I care to invest heavily in. FWIW.

Thanks Jane for the wireframes and explanations. A great help.

I know the side menu topic has been flogged to death and I am coming a  
little late to the party (and I like the side menu although popup  
submenus would be nice) but a couple of queries if I may.

(1) Many plugins that need to define a larger number of admin screens  
also define their own top level menu. These are being displayed  
(currently) after the 'Help' menu when ideally they should appear  
before it. (This makes organisational sense and I am also a firm  
supporter of Stephen Rider's dictum that a plugin should simply be  
presented as part of the base system). Is there a plan to change this?  
Maybe even allow authors to decide where to insert their menu (Up to a  
point!)?

(2) I am looking forward to seeing these new 'icons' on the top level  
menus. Is there going to be an API to allow plugins to define their own?

And - on a code point - although I can see no changes to the menu  
hooks (add_menu_page/add_submenu_page) current top level plugin menus  
are not working correctly. On first selecting one they are loading up  
the front end (with the inevitable 404) and only after selecting a  
plugin from another menu (say 'Manage') and then trying the top level  
menu ones again will they load the correct admin page. This may be a  
bug... or is it a change to the API that I have missed?

Thanks again for the heads up
Andy

Look closely at wp-admin/js/custom-fields.js and
wp-includes/js/wp-lists.js. The wpList is a generic approach to the
ajax stuff, which is attached to the custom fields.

Did you get an answer on this or figure it out? If not, a quick 
pointer is that the AJAX related to Custom Fields is set up in the file:
    wp-admin/js/custom-fields.js

The wpList functionality (which generically handles making AJAX/JQuery 
updates to lists of items that are displayed in HTML tables) is 
defined in
    wp-includes/js/wp-lists.js

Hope that helps...

Is there an action hook that will be called before or after the post
content is displayed?

I don't want or need the filter that applies to the post title or to
the content. A simple reason for this, is that the_content filter is
applied when getting an excerpt.

I wish to display information before or after a post using a plugin,
and it is not feasible to use themes, due to the fact that the plugin
is meant to be generic (and not tied to one theme).

"the_content filter gets applied to the content before it trims off
the end. It has to do this, because the raw content may contain things
that control formatting or replacement of words and such and you don't
want those to be bypassed just because you're getting an excerpt." -

I'm pretty sure I've used the_content as an action as well. Try it and see.
99% sure though.

Yes, you can use the_content as an action, however, as far as I can
tell, it just works the same way. That is, when using get_the_excerpt
and there is no explicit excerpt, it will use the post content,
/after/ it has been filtered (i.e. after information that shouldn't be
displayed in the excerpt has been added), whether you use add_action

There's a filter, but I'm unsure on an action hook:
add_filter('the_content', 'your_filtering_function');

Jennifer and Otto: thank you for the pointers.

A while after I emailed I finally made sense of wpList and how it  
constructs requests. I guess I was too caught up in looking for "add- 
meta" as a single string somewhere.

Here's how you can get around this:

function content_changing_function($text) {
  [... change content stuff here ...]
}
add_filter('get_the_excerpt', create_function('$t',
'remove_filter("the_content", "content_changing_function"); return
$t;'), 9);
add_filter('get_the_excerpt', create_function('$t',
'add_filter("the_content", "content_changing_function"); return $t;'),
11);
add_filter('the_content', 'content_changing_function');

This removes content_changing_function as a callback for "the_content"
right before "the_content" is applied to the excerpt.

Thanks, that works fine (it changes quotes to numeric character
references (HTML character encoding) e.g. &#8221; or is that
WordPress?, but I don't mind).

I don't understand how it works at all. but works it does.

Thank you for not making me pull my hair out any more!

I just committed a change to move Help to the end.

I'm thinking plugins should be able to insert a menu after the other
object menus (Posts, Pages, Comments, etc.) and at the end right
before Help.

Is it only happening when the Dashboard is the current page?  There's
a bug there that I need to fix.  Top-level menus work for me
otherwise.

I may be confused about the cosmetic changes coming up, but I can see  
situation wherein putting it after Dashboard/before Posts would be  
useful too.

Couldn't it just be another parameter?  Pass the URL of the image file?

On my old Admin Menu plugin I looked in the plugin folder for an image  
file with the same name as the plugin menu name. So 'podpress', for  
example, would look for a 'podress.jpg' and if not there would use a  
generic 'plugin' icon. Maybe not the best way but it worked. Or maybe  
an extra argument to the add_menu_page function...? But that would  
need to be backward compatible.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Where Do I Configure This Plugin
Message-ID: <48EC558F.1010902@jeffro2pt0.com>

Andrew Rickmann has come up with what I think is a pretty cool idea, 
http://www.wp-fun.co.uk/2008/10/01/unobtrusive-config-for-fire-and-forget-plugins/ 
If I am reading into his post correctly, this would allow a configure 
link to be displayed in the Plugins page where the activate and 
deactivate links are. Placing a configuration link in that spot makes 
complete sense to me and would finally allow the settings pages for 
various plugins to be in a predictable location. Ever since I began 
using WordPress (2.2) I've had to deal with plugin authors placing their 
configuration page in this place or that place, making it hard to find 
the darn thing. Of course, plugin authors would have to adapt this idea 
but it sure would save a lot of time for many people as we wouldn't have 
to search throughout the backend to look for those configuration pages 
anymore.

What are the downsides to an idea like this?

Apparently not. Based on some more research, this issue has been brought 
up before. http://wordpress.org/support/topic/63824?replies=13 and 
http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005247.html 
respectively. For whatever reason the forum thread was closed.

Now, Andrews idea is based on what he has seen Habari do and although I 
wouldn't want to see a 100% clone of what Habari does instituted into 
WordPress, I think the way Habari does it is much better than the loose 
ways of WordPress. However, as was brought up within that forum topic, 
this would be a loose standard to apply as the software is Open Source 
and plugin authors would be able to continue to do what they want, 
despite the fact that the ability to do this already exists.

Considering all of the discussion based on this idea is at least two 
years old, is it safe to say that we will always have to deal with 
plugin authors making the final decision on where to place the settings 
page wherever that might be?

The only other thing I can imagine is a plugin to consolidate plugin 
settings onto one manageable page.

Whatever comes out of this, any standardization in how plugin authors  
should make config pages would be good. I often find that I spend a  
whole lot more time writing the backend for a plugin than the actual  
function it needs to take care of, and I somehow feel that users would  
benefit hugely if all these backends would look somewhat more alike.

Best,

One better: get the current filter (actions are just filters internally,
but without returning anything) using the current_filter() function.

U think this is a famous idea for small options, reduce the
options-area. I will use for the next updates and new plguins.

Alternativ: i make a seetings-link to the options-page in this area of
the plugin-page.

I think, we msut write in many languages in many blogs over this theme
- this is the only way to give this informations to all developers.

Sorry for my bad english.

Not so quite.
Everyone seems to be missing the fact that the functionality suggested is  
*inserting the short options page as a row on the plugins page*; utilising  
the Plugin action links which you linked to.

In my opinion:
  * A Row in the plugins table for a single once-off thing such as a API  
key could be allright.

  * Adding a Configure or Settings link in the Action links as per  
http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/06/wp-use-action-links/ should  
be done by all plugins, Infact, There should even be an API for that IMHO.  
It shouldnt be used as a replacement for a Menu item, rather be used in  
combination with a menu item, That way users can go via the plugins page,  
or directly via the menu structure.

But if you do that, isn't that making the problem worst by introducing 
even more configuration links? The end user part of me thinks Andrews 
idea is so much simpler than browsing and trying to locate a top menu 
link to configure a plugin. Well, the simple fact of the matter is, the 
functionality exists but I don't see anyone using it.

The best way for options-pages with great option-areas:
http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/06/wp-use-action-links/

I use this in many plugins and the users are thankful for this link.

A i think for one options or very small options is the idea with js
from Rick very nice. The backend of WP in 2.7 is nit useable without
JS and so it is possible to reduce the menu.
A it is a problem for users to use WordPress without a mouse and eyes,
she can only use the reader and keyboard.

! Sorry for the bad english. I hope you understand me.

Wow. I had no idea about that! I just updated my automatic-timezone
plugin to do this. It works quite well. I like the idea of putting the
settings pages here, especially for those set-once type of plugins.

I'm not sure whether it's a good idea to remove the configuration link
from the Settings menu as well though, as some people might not be
able to find it easily that way. But having two links to the same page
from different places kind of offends me too.

We need to encourage this sort of thing more.

Going through and re-reading his bit about action links, I totally 
wouldn't mind seeing this implemented by plugin authors as well, perhaps 
in favor of a sliding window. A simple link pointing to the 
configuration page would be fine by me.

I would like to point out that this method has several drawbacks:

1. The Settings link sometimes goes on a new line, because the Plugin
Actions column is too narrow. This and the fact that some plugins have
a bold link and others don't makes the Plugins table look untidy.
2. "This filter is going to be called for every single plugin row on
the Plugins page" - this is rather clunky: if each plugin implemented
this and there were 20 plugins, there would be 400 calls.

I think that an optional parameter in the
"add_management_page/add_options_page" functions would be better. The
easiest way is to hardcode the link directly in the plugin
description.

Thats quite simple to solve really.  We just fire some plugin specific 
actions as well.

So we can fire:

plugin_action_links and plugin_action_links_{$plugin}

We can even add a register_plugin_action_hook() along the lines of 
register_activation_hook if it makes it easier.

If someone wants to knock up a patch and raise a ticket feel free 
otherwise I will do this and commit it in the next couple of days.

Hey Peter. I'm no hacker or coder so if someone else or you decides to 
write the patch, what will that mean? Does that mean plugin authors will 
be able to easily add a link to their settings page from the Plugin 
Management panel?

Agreed. The idea seems so obvious and useful that I wonder how it's
not part of Core yet :)

That would be most excellent, and bonus points if this can land into
2.7 before feature-freeze.
I guess this would require some thinking upfront (I am not plugin

Back from WordCamps, will try to respond to as many of the points

Hi Stephen. I talked to Matt Mullenweg after reading your comment and  
asked him if I should be trying to make labels more generically CMS- 
oriented or keep the blog terminology. He opted for the latter.

I think that while WP is a blogging platform that can be used as a  
CMS, we look good in comparison to all the other blogging platforms.  
If we declare ourselves a CMS, we'll be judged by a different set of  
criteria and functionality that we don't have currently, so even  
though people use WP as a CMS, I also think it makes sense, for now  
anyway, to retain the blog platform identity.

Uploading a video isn't really writing, though. Even adding a link to  
the blogroll is more like typing or copying and pasting than writing.  
I get the love of the Write label, being a word/writing geek myself,  
but as more non-text formats become common, it's probably not the  
best navigational metaphor. Create or Add would have been more  
inclusive, but the decision was made to go with an object-oriented  
top-level navigational model in response to user feedback.

Ozh's drop down menus plugin is fantastic, and I hope many people  
will continue to use it.

Based on the user testing we did on crazyhorse, in which the users  
performed tasks up to 6 times faster after only using the new  
interface for two days (compared with using their own blogs for  
months/years), I'm guessing the earning curve won't be too bad for  
most users. We'll also publish FAQs, screencasts, etc. in the week or  
two ahead of the 2.7 launch so people who do have trouble making the  
change will have a reference.  As to many people not liking it, yeah,  
possibly. When there are millions of people liking anything, it's an  
infrequent occasion that they all agree on anything being the best  
way to do something. Except maybe kittens. Everyone likes kittens. If  
it turns out that the majority hates it, we'll reconsider the  
approach, but so far the majority has approved of the change. And in  
any case: plugins! :)

The menu will be accessible (you mean tab-accessible, yeah?).

Message-ID: <505c639e0810082010s47ed8fe4p54ab5ec8f2cc8b69@mail.gmail.com>

Good to be back...it's been a while.
I'm looking to build a plugin that will attribute a value to a comment.
Values would be designated by the post author and site admin only. The
values would also need to be attributed to the registered user so a widget
could be made to pull in the top commenters with X value.

I'm planning to build this from scratch but if someone could throw me a bone
with either suggestions or share any similar plugins that already exist it
would help.

Much appreciated.

After all the recent discussion regarding ways to reduce clutter in

Are we really going to have an entire menu item for turning on "turbo"?

For the "Press This" link???

Please, please, please put the "Press This" link back on the write  
post page, and the Turbo button can surely go on one of the settings  
pages -- Miscellaneous if nothing else....

If this is just one of those temporary artifacts of the bleeding edge,

While we're at it, should we also have after_plugin_row_{$plugin} ?

I think a plugin that allowed a defined level of user (admin, editor,
author, etc.) to "tag" comments would be the way to go for handling
the "values" you're referring to.

I don't know if such a plugin already exists, but I would think it
should be based on the WP terms / taxonomy system (see
wp-includes/taxonomy.php for the API methods and the terms,
term_taxonomy, and taxonomy_relationship tables for how they're
stored).

It's a perfect fit for the taxonomy system, since it's designed to
allow you to associate "terms" with various wp objects.

For example:
"Tags" are an association of type "post_tags" between a term and a post.
"Categories" are an association of type "category" between a term and a post.
"Link Categories" are an association of type "link_category" between a
term and a link.

I believe these are the only "out of the box" taxonomies provided in
the core, but they do clearly illustrate the point: you can
potentially use this model to associate anything with an ID (in this
case, a comment) with a term; you just have to come up with a name for
that "association type" - the taxonomy.

You could then build the sort of widgets, etc. you were talking about
and they could make use of the methods provided in the taxonomy API.

Just my 2 cents; hope that helps.

When you include a link to the authro and activate the permalink, then
you became a link to the login-name of the author.
This is a secure-hole. Hackers use this login-namer and searc h for
the password.

examble:
<a href="http://localhost/wpbeta/author/admin/" title="Posts by Frank
Bueltge">Frank Bueltge</a>

Link to:
http://localhost/wpbeta/author/admin/

admin is the login-name and the author had set the name in the Blog on
your namen and surename.

maybe it is possible to cahnge this in 2.7?

Hello,

i'm a member of wordpress-deutschland.org and one of us feature is the
language-file in german for DU and SIE. In the german language is this
a different.

How works the core update to find the language-file. I have read the
wp-hackers-mails and the core and i see, you send the constans WPLANG.
This contans is in german de_DE and it give no different for DU and
SIE.
The language file beacome the user over our website and not in your SVN.

Maybe it is possibel to change this? and a way to different the two
language-files.
We write a plugin to translate all langauges in backend and we will
update for this plugin and a small version to update the langauge file
from the backend automaticly.
We will understand your way to update the core include the language-file.

I have understand your update so:

This is my interpretation of the code in the core.

I hope you understand me and can help me.

The locale set in WP must map to a locale specific subdomain on wordpress.org.

Hello Ryan,

thanks for your fast answer.
I think this is the problem.
How it is works, how you change the different language-file. We have
the language files in aur language, the chinies have 4 or 6 different
language file. This is fundamentel for the language in some langauges.

Maybe you can add a second constans or we different th wplang in
de_DE-du or de_DE-sie ?

I think ,when the people update to 2.7 and use the automativ update,
then we have many support in our forum
http://forum.wordpress-deutschland.org/. We have so many users and a
very fast answers from the community. And now it is not possible, to
use our language file?
Best wishes.

yes! A lot of expandable menus aren't too good for keyboard users. You
can end up tabbing through loads of links, sometimes not visible on
the screen, and sometimes you get top level links that don't actually
go anywhere, but are just there to expand a hidden menu - and
sometimes these just don't work.

You can easily remove that link from your theme files (single.php et
co). No need to change anything in WordPress itself.

I think having sortable tabs might help a lot in this case. If not
implemented in the core, a plugin will surely come to the rescue.

Yes, this is easy.
My users like this link, in many Blogs and Themes is this essential.

I think this is a problem in the function the_author_posts_link()
Maybe use md5 or name+surname etc for the url.

This has been addressed many, many times before. Security through obscurity
isn't real security, plus there are plenty of other ways to get usernames.

Plus every single blog has "admin" so there's no real need to bother with
other usernames.

ohyes. i write in many blogs over security in WP.
The users must be change the default-admin and ther ID.

My problem is not the default-userlogin admin, this was only a examble.
This is with all users in WP. The function the_author_posts_link() use
the login-name, wehn active the permalinks.

Question for westi and everyone --

Should the plugin-specific filter run _before_ or _after_ the filter  
that affects all plug rows?

That is:

plugin_action_links
plugin_action_links_{$plugin}

or

plugin_action_links_{$plugin}
plugin_action_links

?

The follow up question is: Why?  Can anyone think of examples of why  
one would be better than the other?  Does WordPress already follow a  
general rule regarding this type of thing?

I'm also going to add a patch for after_plugin_row_{$plugin}.  Same  
question applies to this.

Again, <http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7856>

To be fair, none of my blogs have a username of admin.  Neither do any 
of the WordPress installs that I do.

As for the topic at hand, the login name is the only thing for each user 
that is guaranteed to be unique except for the id, and that would make 
for some poor urls (/author/234).

The username is not protected information. The password is. Knowing
the username gets you no closer to finding the password, and is not a
security risk at all.

Along the same lines, changing the default "admin" to something else
is also not a security improvement. I generally do change it because I
like using a different login name, but it doesn't help security one
little bit.

Nobody ever hacks a WordPress blog by figuring out the username and password.

I agree that "Knowing the username gets you no closer to finding the 
password" and I'd agree that I don't consider it a "security risk" or 
"security hole."  However, I do thing that knowing the username gets you 
closer to getting into the system, and that changing the default "admin" 
login to something else DOES improve security.  Maybe not by a lot, but 
it does.  You need a matching username/pass to get in, and if you don't 
know either it will take you longer to break in by brute force than if 
you have one of the two.

While I agree with Stephen on this subject, I'd rather wait and see
how this evolves. The team is hard a work on the new admin interface,
and I wouldn't want to draw conclusions from possible draft ideas.
Nevertheless, I cannot see how 12 menu options can be an improvement
over the previous 4+3 of old times. I'm watching.

I think turbo is a whole new kind of animal. IMHO it should be
prominent and have an image and be shown on all pages until it gets
acted on. Obviously if you use it then it dissapears and there should
be a 'hide this' link somewhere, but each user should be forced to
consider it seriously because it could really help them and they are
likely to have not heard of gears before (thus needing a helpful
nudge).

One thing to note:

The permalinks to the author page are based on user_nicename, not user_login (in the user table).

By changing the user_nicename to something different, we get the desired effect of not displaying the actual login name on the links to the author. 

I use this trick often. Not sure if it is part of the UI.

OK, im sorry i have read in the function and you use the nicename for
the permalink.

function the_author_posts_link($deprecated = '') {
	global $authordata;
	printf(
		'<a href="%1$s" title="%2$s">%3$s</a>',
		get_author_posts_url( $authordata->ID, $authordata->user_nicename ),
		sprintf( __( 'Posts by %s' ), attribute_escape( get_the_author() ) ),
		get_the_author()
	);
}

I think, many user use the nicename as loginname, this is the problem
and not the function.

Couple things:

1) Remember, for 99% of users the goal isn't to foil a trained,
motivated, creative cracker who is spending their days poking holes in
your setup. There is probably 1 of those crackers for every ten
thousand wordpress blogs out there. The goal is to foil the goddamn
bots that that 1 jerk writes. The bots are the ones that spam the
whole internet using wp security flaws and they are the risk for most
sites (though I think the script overlords give special care once
they've hacked into a site that has a particularly good Google ranking
for obvious reasons).

Those bots aren't as creative or skilled as the real hacker and they
are a *lot* easier to write if the hacker assumes the defaults and
attacks based on them. Changing your defaults isn't perfect but it
makes a difference, and its a way for people who want to add to their
security to do so based on their expertise without taking too much
time. It gives big, serious wp sites the opportunity to avoid the
stupid robots and hope that they are never faced with an actual human
attacker.

2) The author url thing is actually annoying in a ton of ways because
whether it's hard-coded into the linking function or not, the
experience is that "login name == url text" and there's no visible way
to change in. On our site we've started giving all our users really
annoying login names with their full first and last name so that the
url will be /authors/jeremy-clarke/ rather than smart user names like
'jer' or 'jeremyc'.

So: it would be really nice if the author urls were
editeable/choosable or if they just used display_name instead of login
name for both potential security benefits and because it would be
aesthetically pleasing. It really is weird to click on a link with a
name on it and come to a url with the person's weird internet alias.

Why not just use a lowercase url-ized version of display name for
author urls? Isn't that completely better? It would be some work maybe
to make sure that the old links still work using canonical urls, but
that's what its there for. Really it should be doing that anyway,
guessing about different versions of the usernames in urls.

Last thing: Why is there no permalinks field for the author base? If
anyone is going to look into this its the perfect time to offer that
as an option (this has come up before, i forget if there was a reason
other than lack of motivation).

It was pointed out that it actually uses the user_nicename field,
which is the sanitized version of the user_login field. Change the
nicename = change the URL. Nicename is not editable anywhere though.

You could use the pre_user_nicename filter to change it to something else:

function change_nicename($nicename) {
return sanitize_title($_POST['display_name']);
}
add_filter('pre_user_nicename','change_nicename');

It's there, just has no option in the admin menus to edit it. Just
change the global $wp_rewrite->author_base to whatever you want it to
be.

Ugh. Thanks for the tips, both are good advice but in both cases I
would MUCH rather it be part of core so that I don't have to think
about it and worry about maintaining it going forward.

>> So: it would be really nice if the author urls were editeable/choosable
or if they just used display_name 

Though I'm new to this list and hope you'll be kind to me for stating my
opinion, I strongly agree that author urls should be editeable/choosable
(note: I have researched URL design at length and have a strong opinion as
evidenced by my blog on the subject http://blog.welldesignedurls.org
although admittedly I've not blogged there in a long time).

>> Why not just use a lowercase url-ized version of display name for author
urls? 

That would be a great default.

>> Last thing: Why is there no permalinks field for the author base? If
anyone is going to look into this its the perfect time to offer that as an
option (this has come up before, i forget if there was a reason other than
lack of motivation).

That would be nice.  

Better would be to abstract the URLs so they can be configured completely
would be better. I have some "URL Routes" code I wrote for a plugin that I
could contribute.

I agree with this as well. That would be like, making a menu slot for 
the "copyright" information, or User Login / Logout. The "Turbo" and 
"Press This" should just go back to where they were originally... But, 
that's just me... :\

We're using FTP, so file permissions don't really matter (only owner does
and it's unlikely that's the cause). And anyway the error isn't about
permissions, the error means it's unable to located the WordPress folder in
your FTP.

I'll be looking into this next week, Unless someone else works it out  
first..
The problem code is in WP_Filesystem::abspath(), Which is the same code  
which locates the plugins and theme directory, So not entirely sure why  
its not working.
It could be something as simple as a trailing slash being present, or not  
being present..

Gotta be something simple like that if it's the same code as my plugin
upgrades work flawlessly.

it is possible to make a var_dump() with the paramters?

Maybe i can include a var_daum in do_core_upgrade() and send your the content:

It does indeed appear to be that the trailing slash on the path is killing  
it.
I'll post a ticket up to trac later tonight with a patch & some  
documetation.

Fix just went in as part of [9117]:  
http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/9117

If those affected could manually svn up and attempt again, or copy the new  
class-wp-filesystem-base.php into place and try again, it'd be appreciated.

Can i get some information on your setup?
What is ABSPATH set to?
What folders do you see when you login via FTP?

Eg.
ABSPATH is /home/dd32/public_html/wordpress/
When i connect via FTP, I see /public_html/wordpress/

What's the case with yours?
(You can reply off-list if you prefer)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Getting the path in which the Plugin is installed
Message-ID: <485dd1460810131116k28ae1369t8ad0ec5168472299@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Can anyone please let me know how to find the path in which my Plugin is
installed?

Say suppose my Plugin is installed inside a directory called my-plugin
inside the wp-conetent/Plugins folder then I need to get
my-plugin/my-plugin-filename.php

I can get the filename alone using basename(__file__) or the entire path
using the __file__ variable. But I want to get only the directory name and
the filename.

Please let me know whether it is possible or do I have to manually parse the
__file__ variable.

Incase if you are wondering, I want this to pass to the deactivate_plugins()
function to deactivate my Plugin if the required conditions are not met.
Ofcourse I can hard code this value, but I want to handle the condition, in
which the end user might rename the folder or the filename.

Thanks in advance.

With Regards,
Sudar

Subject: [wp-hackers] Feature Freeze, Wireframes, Visual Design,
	Bug Scrubbing, and Beta Testing
Message-ID: <c8f37c930810131632j40bbaa3atdaeeb8d90291a9ac@mail.gmail.com>

(Cross-posted to hackers and testers)

Feature freeze is scheduled for today.  We've landed all of the
planned features, so I think we're ready.

A todo list for the wireframe implementation is here:
http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/have-gone-through-a-list-of-fixesupdate/

The wireframes are here:

http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/wf-dashboard_v002_093008jw.pdf

If there are any screens from the wireframes you want to work on, jump
in.  The categories and tags screens need someone.  See pages 11 and
12.

The visual design is not yet done, alas.  Hopefully we will receive
something this week.  Once I have something to show, I will show it.

It's time to start beating on this thing. New features such as auto
upgrade, plugin install, comment threading, comment paging, and so on
need testing.  If you're already running 2.7, please try out the
automatic upgrade.   Use the "stay updated" link in the footer to auto
upgrade to the latest nightly build.

The 2.7 milestone in trac needs serious scrubbing.  Enhancements and
low-impact bugs need to be moved to 2.8.  Tickets with patches need
the has-patch keyword.   Those with commit privs need to work through
the has-patch list and either commit or defer.  If you have a ticket
you really want to see in 2.7, drop a note on it and wave your hands
in the wordpress-dev channel.

Message-ID: <e5fc9f1d-ab10-4742-882e-dd81b73916b9@j68g2000hsf.googlegroups.com>

I have a plugin that has a stylesheet, and I would like to ensure it's
the last thing loaded in wp_head to leverage the cascade. How can this
be done?

Also, we used to be able to edit files other than just PHP.  I'd like
to offer editing of the CSS file in the admin area but I get a message
telling me it can't be edited.  Any reason why a CSS file wouldn't
allowed to be editable?

Use a high priority with add_action to insure it loads later.  10 is
the default so try something like 60.

Most likely it is because of the file system permissions on the CSS
files do not give the web server access to write to them.  The files
need to be writable by the web server user or web server group.  Have
a look at http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions for
information on WordPress file permissions.

The Plugin editor only allows editing of the actual plugin primary .php  
files at present (Since the 2.5 redesign i believe), none of the other  
.php files or .js files.

Message-ID: <70d23f010810140816p78b7aacbi303cdac242bb669e@mail.gmail.com>

I tried installing custom-write-panel (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-write-panel/) on top of my wp
2.6.2 installation to simplify the admin interface for my client. When I try
to create a new panel and submit the details, nothing shows up.

Has anybody here ever used it or know of another plugin that allows
customization of the admin panel to simplify and help structure data?

thanks,

Personally, I would sit back and wait for the release of WordPress 2.7 
as it will contain the ability to customize the write panel as well as 
customize the dashboard.

How would one get the URL to their own plugin directory? To include,
say, an image tag?

This works, but is rather ugly:

plugins_url(dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__)))

Thanks. I got that fixed.  However, I can't edit any other file in the
admin section inside plugin directories other than the main one. Is
there a way to do this, and why is this limitation even imposed?

Hmmm. I have a client that's using that plugin on 2.6. Odd.

I found a different plugin called Flutter (

does work and has some additional functionality.

How do you like Flutter?  It look good in the screencast.

It also looks a lot like Drupal's CCK (Content Creation Kit) where CCK is
one of Drupal's killer features. Having something for WordPress would
definitely minimize the CMS advantage that Drupal has over WP.

I know there are a few plugins available for admin access via SSL, but
what about the front end? Would it be possible to allow SSL for a
page, or pages, via a plugin, or will the framework not allow it?

I'm looking to add Google checkout , level 2, to my plugin, but it
requires that sites have an SSL certificate.It hopefully won't matter
whether they are  shared or dedicated, and I'm trying to avoid having
to link directly to script.

For what it's worth, this is something I've implemented in my Admin Drop 
Down plugin, where other plugins can define their own icon in the menus.

I think the ideal API for plugins should be something like:
add_filter('menu_icon', 'myplugin_icon');
function myplugin_icon($plugin) {
        if ($plugin == plugin_basename(__FILE__))
                return 'url/to/icon.png';
        return $plugin;
}

I think that it should either be passed into add_*_page or we should 
fire a filter which is based on plugin_basename like the 
activate/deactivate ones so that we don't need to call/write unecessary 
code.

e.g.

add_filter('menu_icon_my_plugin', 'myplugin_icon');
function myplugin_icon($default_url) {
   return 'url/to/icon.png';
}


I prefer the add_*_page version though. As we currently have for 
add_menu_page - [9182]

It would be nice if submenus could have their own icons too. I did it
already by putting an IMG in the menutitle, but a more direct approach
would be nice.

Here's the code that works for me in the current trunk:

$menutitle = '';
if ( version_compare( $wp_version, '2.6.999', '>' ) ) {
	$menutitle = '<img
src="'.plugins_url(dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__))).'/clock.png"
style="margin-right:4px;" />';
}
$menutitle .= __('Timezone', TIMEZONE_DOMAIN);
add_options_page(__('Timezone Configuration', TIMEZONE_DOMAIN),
$menutitle , 'manage_options', 'timezone-config', 'timezone_conf');

So far I really like it. It has many more features than custom-write-panel
and it is providing me with the exact functionality I need right now. So
definitely a thumbs up and worth a try.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Unclickable Widgets - Solution
Message-ID: <48F63165.20905@konstruktors.com>

In latest nightly, under Widget management nothing is clickable.

It looks like .wrap's relative positioning is to blame.

#wpbody .wrap { position:relative; }

So the solution is to remove position:relative from #wpbody .wrap or to
 add clear:both, like this:

#wpbody .wrap { position:relative; clear:both; }

Regards,
Kaspars

p.s. sorry that I didn't submit a patch.

You'll have to send a link to the screen shot for users on the list to 
see it. Here's what I'm seeing as an issue, well... I'm sure it will be 
handle eventually anyway but...

Forgive me if I've got this wrong, but doesn't that affect the whole
site? wouldn't everyone then get redirected to https ?

Allowing people to access the same site from 2 different urls is
basically what I'm after - ie
http://elfden.co.uk/  & https://server.shared.co.uk/~elfden/ (or even
the straight https://elfden.co.uk/). Which I was fairly certain wasn't
possible under a standard Wordpress set up.

sorry yes I'd forgotten this - though there isn't an option to set the
url for this in the settings, so how does this work for those with
shared SSL? Would I be able to utilise one of the functions that does
this to help me solve the problem?

Theres no settings for per-page SSL, I have a feeling that if you were to  
attach to a permalink-related hook, and change it to SSL, then WordPress's  
canonical redirection would kick in and redirect the user though.

WordPress doesnt care for shared SSL vs Dedicated SSL, It doesnt do any  
SSL work itself, thats left to the web server, It mearly outputs https://  
links instead of plain http://

Which is my understanding too.

so http://elfden.co.uk becomes https://elfden.co.uk ? Unsuitable for
shared SSL as they quite often have totally unrelated URL's.

Message-ID: <E320D735-90D7-4E77-B7D6-7433E0E00F3A@motionmill.com>

Hello,

I've installed a Wordpress MU for a multilanguage site.  I use the  
main site as an entry point for the 2 language sites like :

domain.com (main site) and here you can choose to go to the english or  
the french site.

domain.com/fr -> french site
domain.com/nl -> english site

The login screens are located at domain.com/en/wp-login.php so the  
language can be set automatically to english and so for french  
(domain.com/fr/wp-login.php)
.
Now when I want to signup I'm getting redirected to domain.com/wp- 
signup.php which is always in English, but I want it to be translated  
to the language from the site I was visiting (eg. domains.com/fr/).

I've written a small plugin that checks the referer to see from what  
language site you came from and update WPLANG to that language.  Now  
my question is, I have to set this before the language files are  
loaded, how can this best be done ?

kind regards,
Tom

Hi Frank. There are a few changes to the header that have been made in  
design that haven't been turned into code yet, but will be very soon.  
In the revised header, there is no more breadcrumb, and the screen  
titles are back. The Options tab is in line with the screen title, so  
it will not run into the blog name, even if it is long.

Hi Tom,

You might take a look at the existing multi-language plugins for WP 
(rather than WP-MU) and see how they do it. The ones I know of are my 
own Language Switcher (find it at poplarware.com) and Gengo; there are 
also others. LS, at least, has quite a few comments in the code and 
I'd be happy to answer questions.

Good luck,
     Jennifer

I don't think so.  If you add a define(FORCE_SSL_ADMIN, true) or 
whatever, I think only the admin areas are forcibly protected.  I've 
been working w/ wpmu, though, you ymmv.

What difference in behavior do you expect?  Would you allow admin logins 
via http://elfden.co.uk/wp-admin/ ?

It's actually set as a part of wp-config.php iirc.  Not quite sure what 
you mean re: shared ssl.

Cross-posted to testers list.

Hi everyone. The favorites menu in 2.7 is going to be presets rather  
than configurable (coming in 2.8, hopefully), so we're deciding which  
links should be in the menu. Right now it's add new post, add new page  
and manage comments. I posted a poll on my wordpress.com blog, very  
unofficial, very short-term, to get your feedback on which screens you  
think should be the presets, since you've been using 2.7. I posted it  
there instead of on one of the official blogs because it will only be  
open until Friday  night at 11:59pm EDT. So if you want to cast a  
vote, please head over to
http://jane.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/shortcutsfavorites-menu/
today or tomorrow (so digest subscribers have a chance to respond  
also) and identify the screens you would most like shortcuts to in  
that menu.

Thanks!

I don't require this for wp-admin access, this is purely for one page.

Currently the admin access via SSL can only be achieved if the site
has a dedicated SSL certificate, as it redirects http to https - no
other changes to the url are made. Shared SSL commonly has an entirely
different URL so techniques within wordpress core don't help.

My plugin, eShop, currently is only set up for payment via paypal. I
would like to add google checkout but the level of integration I'd
need is their second level - which will only interact with a site over
https. I realise I could just link direct to the relevant script, but
that would have to be a direct URL - which I am trying to avoid like
the plague because of potential issues.

I gotta admit, I'm really not following you here either. What exactly
is your requirement? As far as I can tell, the only interaction
between your site and Google checkout is server to server, meaning
whether or not the wordpress admin screen uses https is irrelevant.

Maybe you can explain, in clear terms, what you're trying to do?

Well I'll try...

Assume site is http://elfden.co.uk/

Google checkout level 2 interaction contacts your site but only via
https. So rather than have the link be something like this:
https://ssl.sharedserver.co.uk/~elfden/wp-content/plugins/eshop/googlecheckout.php
i.e. not directly via wordpress - where I would have to try and
include WP scripts correctly
I would prefer the url to be something like:
https://ssl.sharedserver.co.uk/~elfden/googlecheckout/
ie via the wordpress installation

I may also end up adding  a variable like ?checkoutgoogle to the url as well.

So far as I am aware this isn't currently possible.

It's like having the blog accessible via 2 different url's
http://elfden.co.uk/  &  https://ssl.sharedserver.co.uk/~elfden/


I hope that makes it clearer.

OH! You're talking about using the Notification API? Where they hit
you back directly?

http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/Google_Checkout_XML_API_Notification_API.html

I mean, you keep talking about "level 2", but nowhere in their API
documentation is there any mention of "Levels", so I'm trying to grasp
WTF you're meaning here.

Sure it is. Add a query variable, then hook to template_redirect with
a priority 1.

add_filter('query_vars', 'add_my_var');
function add_my_var($public_query_vars) {
	$public_query_vars[] = 'googlecheckoutnotification';
	return $public_query_vars;
}

Now, you need to check for that identifier and act on it:

add_action('template_redirect', 'my_var_output', 1);
function my_var_output() {
	$myvalue=get_query_var('googlecheckoutnotification');
	if ($myvalue) {
		// do whatever you like here
		// WordPress is loaded up fully at this point
		// you can even use $myvalue to see what the request is for

		exit; // this stops WordPress dead in its tracks, no further
processing is done
	}
}

When you hit https://whatever/yourblog?googlecheckoutnotification=1,
then your plugin takes over, does whatever, and then stops WordPress
before anything happens like a redirect or something.

Yeah, but again, I'm not quite understanding what you mean by that.
That's between Google and your site, not between your site and a
browser.

You connect to them via HTTPS, basically posting XML messages to them.
Your site doesn't need to have any sort of SSL certificate at all,
because you're just hitting their XML API.

ahhhh - ok I hadn't thought of utilising 'template_redirect'. I'll do

Reading that the SSL page is not public facing but just for Google callback?

If so, you can use two WP installs pointing at the same db but use the 
defines WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME in wp-config.php to set the urls 
different so the SSL one doesn't auto redirect the google callback.

Then if you want you can set up redirects for all non-google requests.

My two cents regarding a favorites/shortcuts menu is something you don't ask
in your poll.

Please don't make it a drop-down that requires me to first click to open
then move mouse to click again. Just give me a list of links that I only
need to hover over and click.  Like I said, JMTCW.

Cross-posted to testers list.

Hi everyone. The favorites menu in 2.7 is going to be presets rather than
configurable (coming in 2.8, hopefully), so we're deciding which links
should be in the menu. Right now it's add new post, add new page and manage
comments. I posted a poll on my wordpress.com blog, very unofficial, very
short-term, to get your feedback on which screens you think should be the
presets, since you've been using 2.7. I posted it there instead of on one of
the official blogs because it will only be open until Friday  night at
11:59pm EDT. So if you want to cast a vote, please head over to
http://jane.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/shortcutsfavorites-menu/
today or tomorrow (so digest subscribers have a chance to respond
also) and identify the screens you would most like shortcuts to in that
menu.

Thanks!

You don't need to click as far as I can tell, it works on a delay so you
mouse over for around a second.

Thanks, I still strongly prefer plain links. Having to repeatedly wait for a
delay to expire each time I need it when I have 1000s of things to do each
day is very mentally fatiguing IMO.

Subject: [wp-hackers] More Descriptive Navigation
Message-ID: <5a1dad880810161557u3a5a9688h635a99060b625831@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Not sure if this has been raised on the myriad of different threads on the
new navigation, but the 'Add New' links need to be far more descriptive.

When I hover over the notepad icon it shows me 'Add New', I don't
necessarily know that this will take me to the 'Add New Post' page, it could
mean 'Add New' page, or link, or anything. A simple addition of what we are
actually adding on these links would be very helpful.

It might also make life easier if when you hovered over an icon, the top
item on that popup menu actually said 'Posts' or 'Settings' or whatever, in
bold perhaps, just to make it more descriptive as to what the menu is
actually for.

Just my 2 cents, but very nice job on the current improvements!

Good point, however it would become rather annoying to have that list open
up every time you accidentally skimmed over it to reach one of the links
above it. The delay, I'm guessing, is to determine the intent of the user -
if they stay on it for a short period it shows they want to open it.

I think we can expect some changes with this feature soon anyway, so I'm not
calling judgement until the new design is fully implemented.

Also, to possibly make people more productive, clicking on the icon could
take you to a 'main page' for that section - so clicking on the notepad
could take me straight to the 'Add New Post' page instead of me waiting for
the menu to open.
Again, just a thought :P

Noooo.  That's not what I meant; that would be even worse.

I've asking to do away with dropsdowns entirely for something that is
supposed to be a shortcut.  Drop downs are okay for rarely used items but
just give us raw links for favorites; they are our favorites, after all,
right? IOW, devote some screen real estate to those things we use all the
time; don't force us to use a silly drop down each time for the links we'd
use all the time.  I don't know for sure but I think usability studies would
back up my request.

For example (assuming these were links):
	
	New Post - New Page - Review Spam - Media Library

Again, JMTCW.

There are some changes to the menu since yesterday night and more coming 
tonight :) The 'section titles' are now displayed on hover.

Subject: [wp-hackers] No more "sidemenu" action...
Message-ID: <48F7E083.8020603@poplarware.com>

In WP 2.6, there was an action called "sidemenu" you could use to add an 
item or two to the admin header -- specifically to the links on the 
lower right side of the admin header area. I added this action to my 
multilingual plugin, to add links to allow an admin to easily switch to 
one of the blog's other languages while on the admin side of the site.

I just finally got around to looking at 2.7 today. (I had been out of 
the country traveling for a while until recently.)  It looks like this 
action is gone, probably because the "side menu" is no more. And it 
doesn't look like there is any replacement (I took a look at the code in 
wp-admin/admin-header.php, and didn't see any actions or filters inside 
the header area).

Any ideas? Did I miss something? Any place I should be putting these 
links (I didn't think they fit into any of the categories in the left 
nav)?  Or can we somehow restore the "sidemenu" action, or something 
similar, so I can put one or more links into the header somewhere? I 
figured I would bring it up here as a discussion before filing a Trac 
issue...

Thoughts?

Not sure if it's coming back.  Would adding a post box work for you?
They're draggable now.

Would that just be on the Write screen? If so, that wouldn't work. It 
really needs to be somewhere accessible from any screen.

But maybe I'm not understanding... what's a post box?

Ah, sorry I was thinking of the sidebar on the edit pages.  Nevermind.

I suppose you could make a new top-level menu called Languages.

There should probably be a hook for modifying the top horizontal area  
of admin, but it's hard to tell where exactly with the ever-not-done- 
yet appearance and layout....

The delay between mouseover and expansion is 300 ms. The delay between  
mouse-leave and collapse is 500ms.  This delay is similar to how menus  
work in Windows or OS X. By default, they're not instantly responsive,

Mark:

Any comments on my two cents where I'd like to avoid having to use a
drop-down to select my most used features?  Would rather just a row of
always-available links maybe with the ability to pin and un-pin the
visibility of the row? 

(Or hell, maybe that's a plugin I'll have to write if it gets deployed in
core as a dropdown.)

Couldn't get it to work, so I'm looking at the Admin SSL plugin and
slowly narrowing down how it was achieved in there. I may as well
utilise other portions of it and give eShop users the option of
securing a few other pages - if possible.

Why not?

Also, you could avoid having to install a second WP instance by
checking the value of $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] in wp-config.php.

Something like this:

    if (!isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])
	|| !strcmp($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 'myvirtualsite.example.com')
    ) {
	define('WP_SITEURL', 'https://mysharedsite.example.com/~me');
	define('WP_HOME', WP_SITEURL);
    }

Best regards,

because you are suggesting that people require 2 installations of Wordpress!

I'd tried something similar to that early on. Unfortunately it doesn't
appear to work, at least for me. I've always assumed this was because
of a core WP function.

WP 2.5 has the nice commentcounter in the backend.

Please give a counter in the menu "comments".
Examble: comments (12)

This is very nice and usable to see, how many comments give it. I can
see this on MouseOver when i edit a post  or others
Is this possible?

I don't know if any of you saw this, but apparently SWF Upload which I
believe WordPress uses breaks with the new Flash player. According to
the site it's going to be updated soon, but you might want to consider
including it in 2.7.

Try again. Look at the WP-Microsummary plugin for an example of this
sort of thing working correctly.

The majority of all sites running flash don't work with Flash 10.  Why
should WordPress be any different? ;)

AFAIK, there's no problem accessing a site as both http: and https: 
since WP 2.5, if not earlier. My site works like that. No mucking with 
the URL settings in admin or config, no plugins. Set up a test cert and 
try it.

bah humbugs.

Ok I see where I went wrong the first time - in fact I had 2 problems.
One in the script which was a silly error on my part, but the other
was the actual https URL which if I hadn't tried the Admin SSL plugin
out I might never have realised!

Many thanks - now I'm can start to wrangle the Google Checkout API
into my plugin. That'll probably take a while :)

doesn't work for shared SSL certificates, sadly.

Usually there is only 1 link (if your blog has 2 languages, which is 
the most common usage, you only need 1 link to switch to the other 
language). It hardly merits a whole top-level menu. I guess I could 
add it to "settings", but since it's a temporary setting, it doesn't 
really fit there either.

Is there a way for a plugin to add to the "favorites" drop-down? I 
haven't read the code on that yet...

There is indeed a way.  A filter was added for such tasks.

Here is some sample code for creating a plugin:


function add_to_favorites( $favorites_array ) {
        $favorites_array['#myhref'] = array('Change Language', 'read');
        return $favorites_array;
}

add_filter('favorite_actions', 'add_to_favorites');


I'll break down the one line so it makes more sense

        $favorites_array['#myhref'] = array('Change Language', 'read');

We want to insert a new key into the array where the key is the href
for the link.  In this case I just made it '#myhref' but could be
anything like 'options.php'.

The value for that key is an array where the first element is the
display text and the second is the minimum user role required to see
that link in the favorites.

You are not loosing your mind.  Although I see color: #fff;

But in any case I definitely don't think this was intentional.

I'm writing a plugin which involves emailing posts and I would like to
include a message after the post has been published to give a summary of
the actions (number of blasts, number of recipients, etc).  I'd thought
adding a message to the Write Post screen would be as easy as adding one to
a plugin settings page, but clearly, I was wrong.

What should I be hooking the message function into?

And avoid the classic color scheme for now. Use fresh.  Classic will
be updated later.

I'll give that a try, thanks!

Now all I have to do is figure out what changed in the WP query engine 
that made it so the URL-to-choose-languages magic in my language 
plugin totally doesn't work any more... or else maybe rewrite the URL 
stuff so it is more WP-standard than what I inherited from the 
original author. :)

The template_redirect hook works wonders on the public side, allowing  
my plugins to evaluate the found posts and execute conditional code  
based on the results. Is there any equivalent to that inside the  
dashboard?

Reason: I'm manipulating the post and page editor screens via jQuery,  
but only if the page/post has certain post_meta. How can I check for  
the existence of that post_meta in time to queue the appropriate js

I have a feeling that you wont be able to achieve that.
AFAIK, The headers included before the post is queried, And the admin  
interface doesnt use the same Query functions like the front end does.

Your best bet is probably going to be enqueue them for all posts/pages,  
and hook onto the footer to echo <script>$myscript.enable()</script>  
possibly.  you might also want to check if $post_id is set on the  
admin_init hook, I doubt it is, but if it is, you can base it off that.

It's positioned with CSS, so a plugin could easily do this. I'm sure they
will consider it for other languages (which read from right to left),
anyway.

Wait for the final release so you can see exactly the CSS you will need to
override, as this may change before the end.

Totally amazing. Perfect compromise/innovation on how the menu headers
and dropdown sections will work to give legacy support for people who
want to click on the title while making repetitive tasks way faster to
manage if you know what you're doing. Also very good looking from what
we can see.

This may even get me to upgrade my blog out of 2.0.x :P

What about something like this:

add_action('admin_print_scripts', 'testers');
function testers(){
	global $the_current_page;
	if ( 'post.php' == $the_current_page || 'page.php' == $the_current_page ){

		$test = get_post_meta($_GET['post'],'foo',true);
		if ( $test == 'bar' ){
			wp_enqueue_script('cropper');

	}
}

We need to start a Codex page on migrating plugins to 2.7. Ryan's 
response below to a question on the Tester's list is one item...

Actually, it looks like we need a 2.6 migration article too. Both 
should be linked from this page:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes
and follow the style of the 2.5 migration article.

I can't remember what the changes were for 2.6 compatibility now, and 
(due to traveling for a while) I am also not sure what's changing that 
affects plugins for 2.7. If someone wants to start the Codex articles, 
that would be great. Alternatively, at least send notes to the Hackers 
list, and I can start an article. Thanks!

Same goes for themes, that's quite a bit of work.

Yes, it is some work, and we need to compile a list for Plugins and 
for Themes, for 2.5-2.6 migration, and 2.6-2.7 migration.

I can write it but I am not sure what needs to be written. If people 
can send suggestions to me directly or to the Hackers list, I will be 
happy to compile them into something reasonably readable. Just send a 
quick note. Here's an example:

Plugin, 2.6-2.7: plugins need to register their options, see 
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin/includes/plugin.php#L800

Thanks,
     Jennifer

Message-ID: <161617690810200950o7ed94171ib9a86fabedf40dfd@mail.gmail.com>

We get posts like this all the time on the support forums:

http://wordpress.org/support/topic/211692

While I don't understand the internals, I know that the whole API-Key
situation can get easily screwed up by users who don't know what they
are doing.  Where, exactly, are these users supposed to go for
support? Because we obviously cannot help them, and there is no clear
path to support there.

Also, people seem to be frequently blown off or directed to the
wordpress.org support forums simply because they are using the
Self-Hosted WordPress, which frankly annoys me to no end. I hate
having to tell people I can't help them and that they're in the wrong
place, especially when they went to the right place in the first place
and were apparently not clear enough in what their problem is.

API key issues MUST be handled by the WordPress.com staff. Nobody else
can fix them. So where is the correct place to send these people?

I have put a few things into the Codex Migrating articles for 2.6 and 
2.7. Anything else that should be added? Any corrections? (Edit or 
send additions/corrections to me or to the list.)

For instance, I don't do much with theming, but wasn't there something 
about some styles that themes needed to define for 2.6 to deal with 
media correctly (or was that in 2.5)?

The current articles are at:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes_to_2.6
http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes_to_2.7

Thanks,
    Jennifer

Plugin 2.5-2.6: wp-content directory can be changed via WP_CONTENT_DIR  
AND WP_CONTENT_URL
Plugin 2.5-2.6: new WP_PLUGIN_DIR replaces PLUGINDIR

I wrote an article about this a little while back:
http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/09/hit-a-moving-target-in-your-wordpress-plugin/

In 2.7 we need information on the changed to Admin menus in 2.7.   
Also...

Plugin 2.6-2.7: new plugin_action_links_{$plugin} filter
Plugin 2.6-2.7: new after_plugin_row_{$plugin_file} filter

Can anyone brief us on what exactly are the register_setting and

exactly and how to use them for our plugins?
Especially since the migration page states that WPMU currently uses  
them.

Actually, WPMU doesn't have register_setting() and
unregister_setting() yet. It uses add_option_update_handler() and
remove_option_update_handler(). It will get the register/unregister
aliases eventually.

WP 2.7 doesn't require using these functions, but WPMU does.  Any
plugin that uses options.php as a post handler for option updates must
use these functions to whitelist their options and register
sanitization callbacks for them.  In WPMU, this is required to prevent
admins (who are not necessarily trusted on a WPMU setup that allows
anyone to create a blog) from tinkering with private options such as
rewrite_rules or active_plugins.

Here's how to use them, if you are so inclined.

// Do the following off of admin_init for each setting you want to update
register_setting('some-options', 'option-1', 'intval');
register_setting('some-options', 'option-2', 'intval');

Do this in your option update form:

settings_fields('some-options');

settings_fields() outputs all of the hidden fields that options.php
will check, including the nonce.  You no longer need to setup the
page_options hidden field if you use the new API.

Message-ID: <48FE1A94.30303@poplarware.com>

So it looks like there was a massive effort to get PHPDoc into 2.7, 
for nearly everything. It's GREAT!! My thanks go out to all who 
participated.

My question today is, what to do about the Codex's Function Reference:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference

It has always been incomplete and out of sync with the code. Does 
wordpress.org have plans to have an official replacement, generated 
from the PHPDoc, so we can get rid of the Function Reference once and 
for all? There are several useful sites with cross-refs and such 
listed at the bottom of the above Codex page, but none are "official". 
Which would be the most useful? Are there any useful components of the 
Codex Function Reference that should be preserved? Thoughts?

And what about the Template Tags page in the Codex? That is also prone 
to being out of sync, and could be replaced by phpdoc, maybe? We could 
potentially link to the appropriate files that should contain template 
tags. Thoughts?

I am posting to Hackers and Doc, to get a cross section of opinions...

Message-ID: <45606d480810211227p4392ab61g5b13acf457ac62ae@mail.gmail.com>

I have a plugin which adds some input text fields to the add/edit post pages
(and then adds the information to "custom fields" metadata section) and am
wondering if there is a framework built into WordPress for auto-suggest
(such as on tags). And if so, how to use it.

I've looked around, and while I've found plenty of people creating their own
auto-suggest/auto-complete features, they don't use anything from WordPress
(though they do use WordPress).

If there isn't a framework in WordPress, then what would you suggest?

Michael.

WordPress includes the jQuery jquery.suggest plugin[1] for the tag
auto-suggest, and it makes auto-suggest pretty simple to do.

At least for now, I'd suggest leaving the Template Tag articles (e.g. 
Template Tags/wp_list_pages) for several reasons:
1. Though some may be 'out of sync', there's a lot of information the phpdoc 
site doesn't really detail.
2. Those pages are referred to a zillion times in the Forums.

Well, maybe the question is whether we can expand the PHPDoc, for the 
important functions, so that the PHPDoc has all the detail that the 
current func/template doc pages have. It should, if that level of 
detail is useful. I think the main thing missing from the PHPDoc is 
working examples?

The other question is whether people could find functions on the 
phpdoc site. I didn't think the browsing was very intuitive, on first 
glance (like, what do all those links across the top mean?), and I 
don't think there is a search function.

Hi,
Just my two cents, but I find the PHPDoc template used on
http://framework.zend.com/apidoc/core/
is much more intuitive.  I have set up an example with this template for
2.6.2 here:
http://blueberryware.net/wp-doc-2.6.2/

Thanks

Adam

Nice.

It would be even better if you could open/close the hierarchy (ajax?)

Either way, the indenting and icons make it easier to cruise the list.

Hey Jennifer,

Thanks, you can find those who helped with the effort or at least most 
of them at http://codex.wordpress.org/Inline_Documentation. You will 
found close to about half a dozen. Good people.

The PHPdoc will not be expanded to include examples. It is not meant to 
be expanded. You will still need to have the function reference on the 
codex or even better an API guide on the codex for the functions. The 
goal was never to provide context to the functions, but to what the 
functions are and their purpose. I thank the contributors to the codex 
and hope they will expand upon what is currently in the phpdoc to have 
context on the codex.

You will find some phpdoc includes links to the codex as well and the 
codex could provide links to the trunk phpdoc site on 
phpdoc.wordpress.org as well.

For the decision on having phpdoc.wordpress.org over 
phpxref.wordpress.org. It was mainly which one would display the phpdoc 
better. I would also like to have a phpxref, but given the choice I 
would always choose phpdoc over phpxref. Peter Westwood's 
phpxref.ftwr.co.uk is a really nice solution for the time being.

Was it a conscious decision to limit the action hook in admin-ajax.php  
to $_POST vars only?

	do_action( 'wp_ajax_' . $_POST['action'] );

Or could we just as easily do something like this:

	do_action( 'wp_ajax_' . ( $_POST['action'] ? $_POST['action'] :  
$_GET['action'] ));

We probably can't/shouldn't use $_REQUEST in this context, as cookies  
have precedence, but the above would make something I'm working on now  
a lot easier.

I'd probably just work around it, but seeing that the "ajax-tag- 
search" action uses a GET suggests there can't be too many arguments  
against GET.

Hi
I can do all the basic stuff on plugin development and have gone through the
codex thoroughly.
Can somebody please provide me resources and links on advanced stuff on
plugin development.

Generally I get the advice that read the sources of other plugins.
So please provide the names of best wordpress plugins till date (from coding
perspective) so that I can learn something from their sources.

Thank you for your time.

That looks like a "I did not read the readme" and there is no footer code added.

I will get a comprehensive answer written at .com support so send them there.
That said, the answer will explain that they first check the akismet
screen to see if it is green.
If it is and they have correctly added the footer code as in the
readme then any subsequent error I may not be able to fix. We'll see.

But I bet that person did not read the readme.

Hello,
please it is possible to use a Array an var $hook in the function
wp_schedule_event( $timestamp, $recurrence, $hook, $args = array())

This is important for use hooks in a class.

Thanks for your answer.

Both the Codex and the PHPDoc are important to WordPress developers.  If you
take a look at how many frameworks are documented, WordPress should (and
pretty much is) being done the same way.  You have a comprehensive reference
guide (the codex) in conjunction with a more technical api, which gives
specific function level information for advanced users.
Thanks,

Yes, this is true and the way it is for WordPress. It has always been 
the goal to do it a similar way of the rest of the well developed open 
source coding projects like that of Gallery2 and phpBB.

GET and POST serve two entirely different purposes, and POST is the
correct one in this case.

GET is for situations where you are getting some data back from the server.
POST is for situations where you are sending something to the server.

The main difference is that browsers can cache the results of a GET
request, and if you do the same GET twice, then the second time you'll
get cached data, it won't hit the server.

Oh, I see what you're saying there...

Yes, it might make sense to allow a hook there for the get[action]
piece, but not necessary at that point because you're inside the
switchcase on the posted action. Maybe allowing a get based switchcase
at the top of that file as well would be useful here...

No one is planning to get rid of the articles in the Codex.

But do you think that we need to save, specifically, the Function 
Reference section of the Codex, given that we now have near-complete 
PHPDoc? The Codex Function Reference was envisioned as a technical API 
spec, but never lived up to that (wasn't complete, didn't keep up with 
changes).

The Function Reference in the Codex is generally more in-depth with  
more examples than the PHPDoc. I believe that is useful, though it  
does get out of date and I'm sure is a bear to maintain.

For example, nothing here:

http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/WordPress/Query/WP_Query.html

has an explanation like this:

http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Query

No good, that breaks all the POST actions, because the switch will
always hit that default case, then die(0) on the script.

You still need to have the if statement checking for the existence of
the get action.

So, if you navigate from there to
     http://phpdoc.wordpress.org/trunk/
what generates the "Welcome to WordPress" message? Could we make it 
more lengthy and helpful, like a quick guide to what the links across 
the top of the page mean, and how to find a function?

How about this Jennifer--save a copy of that article to 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference_2.6.x and then edit 
Function_Reference to point to the new repositories.

Message-ID: <91df29a20810220756i54b5dcc8p40de3f40f3d248ff@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to protect a WP directory, something I've done countless
times before in Apache (but not with WP).

Now, instead of appearing the dialog with the login and password
boxes, I get a 404 !!!


92.250.120.1 - - [18/Oct/2008:01:10:32 +0100] "GET
/files/breakthrough-richard-wright.mp3 HTTP/1.1" 404 14204

en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Creative ZENcast v2.01.01"



Here's my files:


.htaccess:

AuthType Basic
AuthName imgs
AuthUserFile /home/absinto/public_html/imgs/.htpasswd
require valid-user


.htpasswd:

imgs:6TFsHlTQhms6Q


Would you be so kind to try:

http://www.absinto.org/imgs/

or

http://www.absinto.org/imgs/firefox.png

The login and the password are both "imgs" (without the quotes).

Could this be something WP related ?

This boggles me!

As a last note, I have no access to the Apache configuration file.

Any help would be appreciated.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

I wasn't thinking that the codex was going to be removed.  My suggestion
would be to turn the function reference into example based pages.  Not every
function will need to be documented their either.  Something along the lines
of this: http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/is what I am thinking.  Granted
the Zend Framework is entirely class based, almost every public function has
an example of how to use it.

For example, when I first started using the Zend Framework, I mainly looked
through the reference guide to find out what to use and where/how to use it.
 As I gained experience in using the Zend Framework, I began migrating my
research to the PHPDoc information, because I once I understood the
functions and what they did, I needed more specific technical information on
them.

While maintaining the function reference will definitely be a bear, I think
using the PHPDoc for reference, writing the function reference as a more
comprehensive guide will be easier, because looking up function specs will
be significantly easier.  Also, there are functions that will almost never
change, making sure all of them have complete documentation and examples
would be a good starting point.  Many of them do, such as wpdb.  I would be
happy to help complete the function reference in this fashion.

Also, is there a way to specifically trac phpDoc updates through SVN?  It
would be a nice starting point to be alerted if a function has changed.
 Sorry all for the lengthy email.

Thanks,
Adam

Good point. I guess there are a few good function reference pages...

I guess I will just put a link on the Function Ref page to the PHPDoc, 
and leave it at that.

Maybe I misunderstood you and your mail is not an answer to mine, but
if that's the case: I never said we should get rid of the Codex. On
the contrary, I keep pushing people my side of the Atlantic to work on
it. It's treasure-trove of examples and in-depth explanation, with an
amount of detail and clarity that no phpDoc or phpXref can compare
with.

That being said, theme- and widget-developers could use something more
dynamic for their everyday reference needs - hence my suggestion to
have wo.org officially host something akin to
http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks, and an equivalent for template tags.

phpDoc remains very coder-centric, and the Codex can easily get out of
date - even more so for localized version. Since WP is now properly
phpDoc'd, it would be really great to make use of this and turn all
the information for each phpDoc comment into a sortable database (per
branche/version, per status, per WP component...).

I don't know how the phpDoc comments could be extracted into a
database, but one can dream, heh? :)

I didn't mean for anyone to think I thought they wanted to get rid of the
codex, sorry for being unclear.  I simple feel that the function reference
would be better of like the Zend Framework's reference guide or like the
Dojo Toolkit's reference guide.  Both projects also have a coder-centric API
(the Zend Framework has PHPDoc for it).
Thanks all,
Adam

Heh. htaccess password protection does not play well with WP's rewrite rules.

Workaround: Create a file on your website. Call it onerror.html. It
can be blank, doesn't matter what's in it. In your .htaccess file, add
this to the top of the file:
ErrorDocument 401 /path/to/onerror.html
ErrorDocument 403 /path/to/onerror.html

There are some strange CSS issues with the admin section in the latest 
bleeding 2.7 (I just did an SVN update an hour ago or so, on version 
[9293]). I know this is in flux, so I will report here rather than 
making a Trac bug... looking mostly good, anyway!

OK. A short list of 2 CSS bugs, hope I am making sense:

a) If I show the text on my left nav (using the >>> button), and 
navigate to a new page, the entire menu is expanded vertically. But 
when I first click >>> it just expands from icons to icons + text 
(horizontally), it doesn't expand each item to show its sub-nav items.

b) The z-order of the Favorites menu items and left nav items is 
backwards. If I have Text turned on (by clicking >>> above left nav), 
and click on Dashboard to expand it vertically (so it has a second 
word Dashboard below), and I open the Favorites menu, I cannot see any 
items past the third item (I have used a plugin to add an item to 
favorites, so I have 4 items). The 4th item

<div class="favorite-action">
<a href="post-new.php?langswitch_lang=es">espa?ol</a>
</div>

is behind the lower word Dashboard:

<li class="wp-first-item">
<a class="wp-first-item" href="index.php" tabindex="10">Dashboard</a>
</li>

Not sure which CSS properties are mixing this up...

That's all for now...

I think when I navigate to a new page with text expanded, it is 
remembering which menu items I had previously opened by clicking on 
their text headers. So that is good, the whole menu is not necessarily 
expanded vertically.

However, if I do <<< and then >>> to contract/expand the text, it goes 
back to totally-closed-vertically state. So after that it is a bit odd 
when you navigate to another page, because suddenly a bunch of the 
items are expanded vertically again.

It is supposed to "remember" both: folded/unfolded sideways and which 
sections are vertically expanded when menu is unfolded. When folding it 
sideways all sections are collapsed so there aren't any gaps between the 
icons.

This is stored in a cookie so the browser will have to reload the window 
or go to another page to "see it".

The css overlap of the favourites menu and the main menu should be fixed 
soon (currently working on it).

That's a vastly huge answer you're looking for.  It really depends on  
what you want to do.

When you want to do a plugin, ask more specific questions.

That being said, I might direct your attention to a series of articles  
I wrote on plugin design. The first one is here: <http://striderweb.com/nerdaphernalia/2008/06/on-plugin-design/ 
 >

Each article in the series has links at the bottom to the next and  
previous in the series. :)

I'll be giving a talk on adding AJAX functionality to WordPress plugins 
at BarCamp Cork II in a few days time, but I presume you won't be 
around. I'll blog the notes afterwards. :)

Otherwise, just use Google!

Thanks Austin (second time you've answered a question for me, I may have to
put your name in the readme, as well as the source code). Except, well, I've
looked through it and I can't work out how WordPress is doing it. I'm not a
JavaScript expert (and that's part of the problem).

I can get it to work in a stand alone file (which means that the word list
file is actually working), however, as soon as I dump it into the editor
page (using the plugin), it doesn't work.

Also, the tags part of the page doesn't include any JS at all, I assume that
it is hooking into the ID for the <p> tag ("jaxtag") except, well I can't
see any of the ids for those elements anywhere I look.

I'm going crazy...

Michael.

P.S. I've taken so long to reply due to not being able to get it to work.

Take a look in wp-admin/js/post.js :

jQuery('#newtag').suggest( 'admin-ajax.php?action=ajax-tag-search', {
delay: 500, minchars: 2, multiple: true, multipleSep: "," } );

This tells jQuery to attach an event listener to the input field with
id "newtag," so that after 2 keystrokes it posts a request to
admin-ajax.php?action=ajax-tag-search with the typed input value.  It
expects the response suggestions to be separated by line-breaks.

There is no such thing as "the most advanced plugin" or "the best code".

Gah, stupid Lotus Notes sending the message when I'm not done yet:)
So, there is no such thing as "the coolest code ever". Advanced in what 
field? What feature?
Most of the times, the brightest bits of code I find about are one or two 
liner stuff from plugins that won't even get popular (because popularity 
is about features, not code)
I suggest that you browse the plugin repository, by tags for instance, 
read the description of the plugin and wonder "ok, how would I do that?" 
and compare your thinking with the plugin code.

Hi Mario,

Well if that piece of code is for avoiding direct calls to the files
(instead via wordpress) then imho you are wasting a lot of code cause
its better to do this...

if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )
	die();

Since ABSPATH is a constant defined in wp-load.php (or at
wp-config.php), making sure that the constant is defined its a better
way to tell if the file is being request directly or included in
wordpress.
But of course please tell us what exactly is your intention with that
piece of code (is it for the main index.php or for a plugin/theme
script file?)
As far of security... i don't see any pitfall just (as previously say)
a really waste of code to do a simple thing.

Regards

Hi,

Suddenly, without any explanation, I can't switch from Visual to HTML
mode in the writing articles editor.
I've already restored my backup, but the problem persists, both in FF and in IE.

I have JavaScript Enabled, of course.

In IE, I can see this error:

Any ideas ?

Any help would be appreciated.

In my experience, these errors are caused by plugins with issues.
Usually those issues are blank spaces at the bottom of .php files.

Try disabling your plugins, and adding them back in one by one?

Seems like wp-admin/js/editor.js is missing or corrupted. Also check the 
error in FF or Opera, IE doesn't really give much info.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Annoying issues with wordpress today
Message-ID: <39fdab560810231432t18b40442kd0cbfe0d42900aca@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

For some reason nothing that I'm doing today with Wordpress is
working, and it's really bothering me.

For starters... I'm building a site using 2.6.2. My first issue is
with a small contact form plugin I wrote. It's on a page with a custom
template. The page loads fine when I view it, however when I submit my
form (POST) to the exact same URL, I get a 404 error. This plugin
works fine on my own blog, so I can't explain why this isn't working.
Anyone know why this might be happening?

Second issue is with media uploading. I'm trying to link to some MP3s
I uploaded. I put the direct links into my page, and when I save it,
Wordpress goes and changes all of my links to point to the "post" for
the same file, which in turn displays the direct link. What gives?

Daniel

Hey, can anyone tell me what all was changed from 2.6.2 to 2.6.3. I lost 
track of the emails in my mail client, and don't remember what all was 
changed from 2.6.2 to 2.6.3. I'd hate to download ALL of the 2.6.3 files 
and then upload them, just to upgrade the blog. It's easier for me to 
just snatch the updated/changed files. Thanks.

Example:

wp-content/themes/this-theme/thisfile.php
wp-includes/blahblah.php file
and so forth.

Good catch! Thanks DD32! I'll download that too. Hopefully they'll

Yes, I noticed that media.php change too. I've just update all of our sites
by replacing the following 3 files:
wp-includes/class-snoopy.php
wp-includes/version.php
wp-admin/includes/media.php

Odd, That function shouldnt be in wp-includes at all:
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/branches/2.6/wp-admin/includes/media.php
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/branches/2.6/wp-includes/media.php

Looks like you might've replaces wp-includes/media with  
wp-admin/includes/media.php?

Okay, I got it back to working order now. I just uploaded that media.php 
file to the wp-includes/ folder, instead of the wp-admin/includes/.

Yeah, that's what I did wrong. Uploaded the file to the wrong location, 
but I got it back now. I just went and downloaded the 
wp-includes/media.php file again, and uploaded that to wp-includes/ then 
put the wp-admin/includes/media.php where it belonged. :) ;) Thanks 
again for showing me that post, I didn't even see it earlier! Time to 
put more coffee on!

To me this now looks like clicking the entire thing will expand it.
Maybe we could just make the arrow visible all the time? What do you
think?

Many people read in the dashbaord the planet and so give it the news

Hi,

as far as I understand it, all plugins on WordPress.org have to be GPL  
- compatible right?

This plugin though:

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featplug/

Says in the license on the authors homepage, found here:

http://featplug.huseyinuslu.net/#licence

"Featplug is free for non-commercial use. For commercial usage and  
redistribution with commercial packages please contact the author."

That is not entirely GPL compatible...

How does Automattic handle such cases?

best,
Joost

Whether a plugin has to be GPL or not is open for debate (I'm not a lawyer)
and it's the same issue with premium themes.

However if you want to host a plugin on WP.org, yes, it HAS to be GPL
compatible. It'll be removed from WP.org once someone who can do it sees
this e-mail.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Resetting after multiple loops
Message-ID: <49018A14.2090901@redefine.co.uk>

Hi all,

I've been writing a number of widgets based on the style of the recent 
posts widget that comes with WP - e.g. listing the most recent posts by 
an author, for a category, etc. But I've come unstuck with side-effects 
on other globals even though I'm using what seems to be the suggested 
pattern of using 'new WP_Query(...)' followed by wp_reset_query().

I think the problem is caused by the_post(), but I can't see anything 
documented about resetting globals after you've used that.

If you try the following on a fresh install of WP:

* create a new post
* add the recent posts widget to the sidebar
* change sidebar.php in the default theme to display the value of $id
before & after the sidebar contents
* change single.php in the default theme to  use the sidebar

When I view the new post on the website I have different values for $id. 
If I comment out the loop that's used in the widget then they're the 
same. If I stick something like 'if (have_posts()) the_post()' at the 
end of the sidebar then I also get the same values.

So the sort of problem I've been having is that if I have another widget 
that's supposed to display the details of the post author then it could 
change if I place that before or after the recent posts widget.

Is this a bug or am I missing out on something else? (And should I be 
posting this elsewhere?)

Best wishes

Nigel

Hi everybody,

I would suggest, that there is a possibility to add (hidden) plugins to the
wp.org-list for the auto-update feature of wordpress.

I'm using a not-gpl plugin, and I have to check manually, if there is an
update for that plugin. I don't like that.

Philip

Why would WordPress have to provide such services to plugin authors  
who do not share alike they do?

Because the focus has to be on the wordpress users?! And not on these plugin
authors.

I don't want, that wp.org promotes these plugins, but in my opinion wp.org
has to support the update process of these plugins, too.

Please have a look at the follow situation:
1. A Blogger sets up a new Blog (not a tec-guy!)
2. He founds a plugin that he loves, bought it, installs it
3. He founds some other plugins (GPL) installs them, too

2 month later: 
4. There are several updates for all plugins and wordpress.
5. Because he uses wp2.7, he installs the new version with the auto-update
feature of wp
6. He recognizes that for some of his plugins new versions aviable and he
installs them, too.
7. He will not recognize, that there are also an update for the bought
plugin. Because he will expect, that wp would show him this information.

Maybe the blog will be hacked through the bought plugin.

How would anybody of you (or automattic) explain him, that wordpress didn't
show the version warning of his bought plugin, because he bought it? Come on
guys...

Once again: I don't want, that wp.org promotes theses plugins. I only want,
that it helps updating, because the user will expect it.

Regards,
Philip

The same actually applies to plugin developers who choose not to host  
their source code at wp.org for whatever reasons - and there are a lot  
of these. 2.7 increases the almost insistent drive to have them hosted  
there and your average user will believe what they see there is what  
is available. This disenfranchises users and those developers.  
Allowing an entry in the plugin list re-directed to the plugins home  
url would correct this situation and I cannot see that anyone would  
lose out by it.

Maybe if the plugins page makes it clear whether wp.org recognises the 
plugin or not. That way the user is aware that they have to keep track 
of upgrades rather than rely on the automatic notification. At the 
moment you're right that if they haven't seen any message then they 
might assume that everything is up-to-date.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Comments moderated, but yet they appear
Message-ID: <4901B1BD.6090809@gmail.com>

Hi,

I had for ages comments moderated in my blog - http://www.absinto.org
It required an administrator to approve them.

Suddenly, without any explanation, people write comments on the blog and 
they immediately appear on the site, although in the dashboard they also 
appear to be approved or not, as usual.

This is very weird.

You can see here how I have it configured, but I'm sure it's right and 
besides I didn't even touch it.

http://www.absinto.org/images/discussion.jpg

Any ideas ?

Any help would be appreciated.

Warm Regards,
M?rio Gamito

The commentor will be able to see their comments, And it *may* be that  
Logged in administrators can see unmoderated comments too

Have you checked that when viewing the comments page in a browser that is  
NOT logged in in any form (Clear the cookies too) that you CAN see the  
unmoderated comments?

The plugin has been removed.

Plugins are generally checked and where there is doubt the author will
be emailed at the time of submission.

As for hidden plugins I really cannot see why that would be desirable.

But that never happened before and suddenly without me doing nothing for it
is started acting like this.

Is it some variable ?

Yes, and I can see them.
Also, I asked a few friends of mind to test and they've confirmed.

It's been discussed before.  I made a patch a while back that informed  
users which plugins were _not_ checked for updates, so they would at  
least know that they have to check those manually.  It requires  
changes to the data the update server returns though.

My personal opinion is in agreement with you.  Making it look as  
though those plugins have no updates available is doing a disservice  
to WordPress users, _and_ to those plugin authors who, for whatever  
reasons chose not to host their plugins on the WP server.

In that case then, Its definately not my first thought.

Agreed. Not being hosted on wp.org or GPL'd doesn't a bad plugin make.
I'd be strongly in favor of a minimal message indicating that WP
cannot notify user of the latest version of such plugin, and that it
needs to be updated manually.

Stephen, care to link to your patch, for reference's sake ?

-x.

I don't think any such messages should be provided. Only hosting open source
is a good decision because it encourages plugin developers to release their
code if publicly they want to take advantage of the perks. If you're going
to charge for a plugin or not release the code publicly, that's you're
decision, but it's obviously not the model WordPress has decided to follow.
Besides... there are other ways to update the user if you're the plugin
developer. PodPress has been doing it long before 2.5 (not that anyone's
seen an update in awhile)

BTW, what about zend encoded plugins. I've seen a couple of those... <

Promoting open-source is an excellent thing, and I am glad Extend
enforces it: it makes for a very diverse source of code to get
inspiration from.

I have other thoughts on not taking into account developers who prefer
to release their code another way, but do care enough about their user
that they'd like to update the plugin when needed, while still getting
users to update. Sure, they chose to do without auto-update or version
notification, but they just might want users to be aware that WP will
never let them know about a new version.

(not a plugin dev myself, btw)

This is short-sighted, IMNSHO.  In this situation, the plugin devs
will never be blamed by the end users; rather, WordPress itself will
be faulted for not taking it into account.

I've suggested multiple times, on-list and in Trac, that the API
server be set up to return an additional status code -- "NOT FOUND" or
somesuch -- and the Plugins page UI be adjusted to note that plugins
existing off-ranch are explicitly NOT being checked for updates.
Otherwise, the UI is confusing and misleading.  Folks will think their
plugins are being checked for updates when, in fact, they are not.

It's a very low cost proposition with a VERY high potential ROI, thus
I'm still scratching my head at the resistance to implementing it.

Always use code like this if possible:

$var_name_other_than_posts = get_posts( 'some=parameters' );

foreach ( $var_name_other_than_posts as $post ) {
// do stuff
}

That way you never touch the query. Infact get_posts() now internally uses
query_posts() or whatever so there is very, very little you can't do with
get_posts().

I agree completely Doug. It's one thing to inconvenience developers in 
order to try to encourage open source development. It's another matter 
entirely when you make an end user who doesn't know FOSS from floss bear 
the cost of the decision.

At the risk of adding just a +1, I'm all for only hosting GPL plugins  
on wordpress.org - people are free to put plugins elsewhere if they  
choose to make the argument that plugins are not derivative works of a  
GPL' d project.

This is also consistent with the Drupal.org approach. From http://drupal.org/node/7765 
  :

"Please note that all code which is committed into the Drupal CVS  
repository must be covered under the terms of the GNU General Public  
License, version 2 or greater; the same as Drupal itself."

I just want to say that there are other reasons besides open-source 
licensing to not host plugins on wp.org.

Here's an example. I have 2 plugins that are (of course) licensed GPL 
that I don't host there, because getting them to work in your blog is 
not a simple matter that an automatic install can take care of (you 
need to modify your theme, get a Google Maps API key, learn how to 
write multilingual content, etc.). People who install these two 
plugins need to read and follow all the instructions on the plugin 
home page (not that they actually do), or they won't work at all.

So, offering a "simple one-step install" for these two plugins makes 
ZERO sense to me -- people would install them, they wouldn't work, and 
then they'd just deactivate and go on, without finding out what they 
needed to do to get them to work. Besides, if more people found them, 
I'm sure I'd have even more support questions to answer. :)

Not that my voice really matters that much, but this should be a given...

I personally think it's wrong to write non GPL compatible code for a GPL
project, but the end users still need to know that their plugins are not
being checked for updates. It may be that people should be able to keep
track of what they have downloaded from where, but a lot of people have
multiple websites with different setups, or somebody else set it all up for
them...

Besides, if we can have a section that says "Hey, you tried these but didn't
like them or they didn't work so you disabled them and now you have to
scroll past them to enable something that might work right..." why can we
not have a "WordPress cannot check the following plugins" section?

Yeah, this is actually new as far as i can tell. get_posts() did its
own weird SQL as recently as 2.5, but has been getting starndard with
the passing of time.

Creating a new WP_Query() seems like the better approach to me, as
that never touches the default query in any way.

Whereas get_posts() can be confusing and difficult to use.

I'm a new voice on this list, but I've got a combined 20+ years experience
in both the development and business end of software and I agree with those
who say that punishing the end user for the decision of a software provider
is very short sighted. 

The WordPress community will be best served by notifying end users that
their commerical plugins are not updated so that they are at least aware.
This is actually a perfect opportunity to educate the end users on the
difference between GPL and Commercial plugins and the benefits of the
former.  Not notifying end users will just upset WordPress user and as has
been said here by others have them spread the message that WordPress is an
unreliable platform for which, ironically, they will be correct.

Rather than view this as a war of ideologies where you inflict harm
whereever possible, please consider instead turning this into an opportunity
to educate your allies (i.e. WordPress users) on the merits of your cause
(GPL) and do your best to generate good will amongst them.

It might be better to use the word "proprietary" instead of "commercial"
since it is non-GPL
compatible<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses>software
that would be the concern.

For those interested, the Software Freedom Law Center recently published A
Practical Guide to GPL
Compliance<http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/compliance-guide.html>that,
IMO, was worth the read.

FWIW I agree 100% with Doug and others who have posted similar views. Why not have a simple warning message that tells the user that the version status of installed non-hosted (wp.org) plugins cannot be determined, and advise the user to manually check for upgrades for these non-hosted plugins?  It seems to me that this would be very beneficial to users.

Regards,

Ade.

Message-ID: <93c3fbd10810241302q1f4fe32fwa62c808b6df9aae2@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a plugin that uses the body_class filter provided by the
Sandbox theme. Modifying the class element of the body tag on pages is
appearance related, but only as it applies to css. Specifically, this plugin
will add browser, and possibly OS, specific classes to the body tag. It's
primarily intended to ease the problems encountered when writing css that
looks okay when rendered by older versions of Internet Explorer, but could
easily be expanded to customize pages according to browser or OS usage.

I'm not sure if I should place the options page under design or perhaps
settings. I would appreciate any suggestions or comments on this matter.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] nasty issue with plugin upgrader
Message-ID: <C82B1791-99DD-4A94-AFAF-D4E2BAE9A697@tekartist.org>

Hey there,

I just went through quite a nasty experience with the plugin upgrader,  
in WP 2.6.2 (same as in 2.6.3)...

Before you ask, yes, I did confirm it's not a plugin level issue, as  
the same upgrade operation worked fine with the same plugin on another  
WP install.

So here's what happened:
- saw a new version of a plugin being listed in /wp-admin/plugins.php
- clicked on "upgrade automatically"
- the plugin started upgrading, but seems to have lost communication  
with wordpress.org and *forgot* to download some files, namely, the  
main plugin file in the plugin dir.
- then, active_plugins got totally messed up: what was normally  
"plugin_name/plugin_name.php" got reset in active_plugins as  
"plugin_name/" only, which then led to a php include on page load.

To fix it, I had to manually update the value of the serialized  
active_plugins record in wp_options, by removing the bad path.

The safety mechanism that automatically disables plugins from  
active_plugins if the plugin was deleted in the filesystem failed  
because the directory was still there (we had downloaded a fresh copy,  
which showed up fine in the inactive plugin list).

Sorry for the convoluted explanation, but it's a weird context to  
explain.

Stephane

I'd put it in the design menu, probably, but it depends on the
specific options. In much the same way that a theme can make it's own
submenu under Design for the theme options and banner colors and such.

Thank you for the quick reply!

The options would mostly be choices of what to inject as classes in the body
tags. Things like:

Add MSIE derivative browsers?
Examples: AOL, Avant Browser, Crazy Browser...

Add Gecko derivative browsers?
Examples: Firefox, Seamonkey, K-Meleon...

Add OS information, (May not work for all OS versions)?
Examples: Windows 98, Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux, FreeBSD...

I am leaning toward the display section, I thought I should ask about
settings because there would be no immediate changes to the site, it merely
enables the ability to create css entries that target certain browsers or
OS's without resorting to in file hacking...

Thanks again for the quick suggestion :)

Hi everyone. Now that the visual design is being applied a bit at a  
time we're thinking about icons. I'm thinking there are probably at  
least a few good icon designers in the community who might want to  
take a stab at designing the icons, so if that describes you, check  
out the post on the dev blog: http://wordpress.org/development/2008/10/calling-all-wordpress-loving-icon-designers/

Can you name the plugin (A link would be better) that this occured with?
There are a few plugins in the repositories which are not following the  
svn structure correctly, and could cause issues. In the same way, the zip  
creation could've failed, and knowing the plugin thats having the problem  
would be nice

Actually it's a bad assumption to make.  Many of the un-hosted plugins  
are, in fact, GPL.  The only accurate way to describe the plugins that  
aren't hosted on WP-Extend is:

"Plugins that aren't hosted on WP-Extend"

How so? It just returns an array that you can easily loop through. No need
to use have_posts(), the_post(), etc.

Creative Commons licensing doesn't tend to match well with GPL software
in my experience; the icons would need to be either GPL'ed or LGPL'ed to
be able to use them.

If no one sends anything in, then we'd just use the current icons or
possibly hire someone I'd imagine.

Intersting....
This actually goes well beyond what I first thought...
I had clearly understood that, in order to be hosted on WP.org,
plugins HAD to be GPL. No issue with that.

But I didn't understand that all plugins would be considered GPL
automatically and anyway, even if hosted and distributed elsewhere...

That's because it's not true at all, actually.

You can't assume licensing. If somebody releases a derivative work of
WP that is not licensed under the GPL, then they have violated the WP
license. However, only the copyright holders of WP have any standing
to do anything about it, nobody else can. It's not like anybody else
can then simply take the work and assume it's GPL'd.

Even your example code makes the rather large assumption that you are
in the global variable context. Look at how you use $post. ;)

My point is that no matter how you swing it, you tend to leave odd
side effects when messing with get_posts. Using a new WP_Posts doesn't
have those, generally speaking. Not unless you're using it wrong.

Interesting take as well....

So let's say one wants to make a plugin that uses an existing library
to do something.... the existing library ISN'T GPL, but the plugin
should be...
what would one do then?

If you release the plugin as GPL, you would automatically make the
embedded library GPL as well... and the owner of that library will
come and get you... :-)
If you don't release it as GPL, you violate WP's GPL so Automattic
MIGHT come and get you (but they probably don't care...).

I think a lot of people till today simply assumed that they COULD do
something like this, release their plugin under a NON-GPL license...
as long as they would not claim any right to have the plugin
distributed/hosted on WP.org they were OK.
But apparently they are not.... :-(

You can't relicense code that you don't own. So that library is NOT
GPL, no matter what you try to do. You are violating the GPL in such a
circumstance, by distributing non-free code.

However, if you write a plugin that interfaces some GPL code and a
non-GPL library together, and the plugin is GPL, what exactly has been
violated here? Look at it from all pieces:
1. GPL code requires derivative work to be GPL. The plugin is
derivative. The library is probably not derivative, because is an
identifiably separate and unrelated work.
2. The non-GPL library has its own terms. Obviously, you need to abide
by whatever those are.
3. Your plugin is GPL because you said so. You wrote it, and you can't
violate your own copyright.

I am aware that the FSF disagrees with this analysis. But you know
what? The FSF can go suck eggs as far as I am concerned, because they
are flat-out wrong on this point. I've read the GPLv2, and I
understand it, and whether they like it or not, nothing in the above
scenario violates it.

True. 99% of plugins need to be GPL to be distributed legally.

My code makes no assumptions. You can use $foobar instead of $post if you so
wish. I mean you're gonna end up doing setup_postdata($foobar); probably
anyway.

Harumph. Maybe I just like Object Oriented code more.

$myquery = new WP_Query('whatever');
while ($myquery->have_posts()) : $myquery->the_post();
the_title();
the_content();
endwhile;

Heh heh, no, the plugin shall remain nameless, 'coz it's mine. ;)

Kidding, it's the praized-community plugin:
- http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/praized-community/
- http://svn.wp-plugins.org/praized-community/

The only change in the release was to update snoopy (like WP 2.6.3),  
which we bundle with our core lib (though we use WP's by checking for  
class existence).

Also, in case it's related, I've changed my stable tag in the readme  
from a tag in the prev version to "trunk" in the current one.

http://svn.wp-plugins.org/praized-community/trunk/readme.txt

But the upgrade worked fine on other installs. It only failed once  
(but with dire consequences).

Hmmm. Doesn't seem to work for me.

If I change wp_widget_recent_entries in wp-includes/widgets.php from:

$r = new WP_Query(...);
if ($r->have_posts()) :
   ...
   while ($r->have_posts()) : $r->the_post();
     ...
   endwhile;
   ...
   wp_reset_query();
endif;

to be

$r = get_posts(...);
if ($r) :
   foreach($r as $r_post) : setup_postdata($r_post);
     ...
   endforeach
endif;

then the_title() & the_permalink() don't work as it repeats the values 
for the post that you're viewing. It's the same result if I change 
$r_post to $post. (And going back to my original question $id changes 
its value after using the widget).

If I add in global $post; then the widget displays the correct results, 
but the value of $post changes to the last post in the widget list.

Is there something I'm missing out - I can paste in the rest of the code 
if necessary but it's the same between the two versions.

Cheers

Nigel

I must admit that I'm with you on this, in fact I'd like to be able to 
do $myquery->the_title(); etc.

I had started with previous projects using get_posts but wasn't 
comfortable with having to use global $post; to get it to work - and 
then seeing the list of globals in function load_template() I was 
concerned about making sure there weren't other side-effects.

So I switched over to WP_Query after looking at the codex on loops as I 
had hoped that wp_reset_query() would have put everything back to its 
original state. But it doesn't seem to do that for me - have you had a 
similar issue or is there something else I should be doing?

Cheers

Nigel

wp_reset_query resets the global $wp_query, but with that code there's
nothing needed to put something back to the original state because the
$wp_query never got changed.

What  "side_effects" are you seeing? The only side effect will be that
the global $post and $id are used, because of the call to
query->the_post(), but nothing else will change. And the $post and $id
and such only affect those the_* functions, which are Loop-Only
functions to begin with.

In other words, a new WP_Query has no real side effects to speak of,
and if you're seeing any, then you're doing something else wrong.

Hey all,
This was a thread I started back in September. I got around the issue
by not inserting captions via the media manager and doing it on my own
with CSS. The only reason I bring it back up is because a request just
came through on the wp-pro list that references the same problem. I
haven't figured it out yet, but I believe there's some sort of problem
with the last line of the wpautop filter in conjunction with long
posts and the caption shorttag.

Here is a link to the discussion I started last month along with the
post from wp-pro that came through today:
<http://www.nabble.com/What-does-the-last-line-in-the-wpautop-function-do--td19544334.html>
-----
wp-pro post
------
I need someone to troubleshoot an issue that I'm having posting a
4000+ word article, which contains a lot of links and different
formatting.

The issue occurs when I try to add a caption title to an in the post
-- all the text and HTML is wiped out and the page is left completely
blank.  When this doesn't happen, when I go to preview the post, the
post is completely blank.

If I leave out image captions, I'm able to publish the post, but it
screws up all the formatting of the other posts on home page, making
all the text bold.

I am willing to pay someone to troubleshoot this issue.  Please, let
me know your rate.

Message-ID: <38E62A45-0E7F-4A7A-9043-E18FDD5770DD@anekostudios.com>

Okay.  This is a seriously weird question, and I don't even know if it  
can be done - but here goes.

I'm finishing up a (free, I should mention - I don't want you all to  
think I'm making $$ off your good names :) )  site for a local non- 
profit here in town.  They have a monthly newsletter that they like to  
put online - currently it's done in Microsoft Word (gah!  It's  
terrible) and I'm working on bringing them out of 1992.

So these guys elect a new board member to each position every 2  
years.  The actual *positions* stay the same, but the *people* in them  
change.  Due to this fact, I've created user logins that reflect the  
positions available.  Each board position writes a section to the  
newsletter every month, which starts out with the President first  
(monthly "hello" message) and then goes on to the vice president, the  
civics coordinator, fundraising, etc.

(Yes, there is a point to me telling you this.)

Right now, I'm using a tag archive to determine the newsletters  
pages.  Some of the board positions have running articles which stay  
the same throughout the year, but most of them put in something new  
every month.  (some only create one post that's only to show up in one  
month and never again).  So this knocks out the idea of ordering by  
date - because in some cases,  when a post is written in September  
(the beginning of their year), it's unchanged through to July.  So it  
seemed to make more sense to *tag* them with what month/year they  
belong to, rather than order by date and write the same post over and  
over again.  Because of this, I also had to edit the tag archive with  
a query - because the site is set to show the default 10 posts, but  
the newsletter needs to show *all* posts for it's tag on a page.  So I  
had to do a custom query that matched the current month to it's tag  
(because there's not always the same post count from month to month),  
and I don't want posts from September showing up in October.

So right now, it's set to use a month/year tag for posts so they show  
up in the proper page (tag archive).  I can't order the posts by date  
(for reasons stated above).  Each user also has a category that they  
are bound to (using a plugin) so when they write, they are ensured to  
post is the proper category.  But I can't order the posts by Category  
ID or category name (as far as I know anyway - ordering by Category  
would work, but I don't think that's a parameter that's accepted by  
queries right now, plus aren't tags a form of categories?  That would  
make the database's head explode.), so I'm thinking ordering by author  
is my best bet.  So I did that - ordered the posts by Author ID.   
Works great.

*however* there are times when new positions are added, and sometimes  
a few get removed.  So this screws up my order - because if I add a  
new position, and it needs to show up between two other positions that  
already exist, it shows at the end instead of where it needs to go.   
What I *need* is somehow to order by my own custom-defined order  
string.  Right now, I'm pulling it off my exporting the database and  
reassigning author ID's so they show up in the proper order, and then  
importing the new data back in.  *I'm* fine with doing this, but when  
the club has people who are currently using Microsoft Word to do their  
website, and don't even know what "anchor tag" means...you know this  
ain't gonna work.

So finally we get to my actual question (sorry all, I feel like it's  
better to have too much info than not enough!) - is there a way to set  
my order in a custom manner?  Currently the query that's working is  
this:

  $path = $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
  list($root,$tag,$tagname) = explode('/', $path);
query_posts('tag='. 
$tagname.'&showposts=-1&orderby=author&order=asc&author=-1');

But I need something like this:

$path = $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
list($root,$tag,$tagname) = explode('/', $path);
query_posts('tag='.$tagname.'&showposts=-1&orderby='.$order);

Where "$order" would be my own custom arrangement of authors be it by  
name or ID.  It just can't be rand(), ASC or DESC, but instead a  
specific order I define (preferably by nicename) and give to the  
$order variable.

Is there a way to do that?  or am I just dreaming?  I was thinking if  
I could somehow pull in the list of all authors in some kind of array  
(wp_list_authors('echo=0')?  maybe?) and then order the key/value  
pairs as variables, I could do it that way, but I feel like a complete  
dolt right now.  I'm just trying anything I can think of right now.

Anyway, if you haven't fallen asleep reading, I'd appreciate any  
prodding or ideas you all might have on this.

OMG - nevermind.  I'm such an idiot.

I forgot, I have userextra/usermeta installed.  All I needed to do was  
add a new uneditable field (by the user) and assign them a custom  
value - and I can order by that.

Dur.

Thanks anyway!

Hi all:

Just wanted to get your feedback on something especially related to the
recent thread on GPL licensing and plugins that are not GPL (not) being
including in Extend.

I just came across this plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pics/)
for a client who wants me to add features but it appears that it is not GPL
(no reference to license in the ZIP file) and more importantly it appears
that the core code has been encrypted with Zend Guard ("include/lib.php").

Based on the discussion it would seem this component should not be on
Extend, right?

Subject: [wp-hackers] any hook before auth_redirect() ?
Message-ID: <59e7f3130810261053o2e639cbcqb85037f5f1fbafa6@mail.gmail.com>

I had a allow_autologin() function which allowed a anonymous visitor
to submit a post with his email, and be registered, logged in and
redirected to post.php page.
The function was working on my development version (2.7 r ~9000)
I updated today r 9353 : the function is not working anymore.
It seems that auth_redirect() acts before init (which I took for the
first hook in wp admin page loading)
Before I had :
site.com/submit , form action = wp-admin/post-new.php > init hook
register a new user and log him in > redirect to edit page
now, I have :
site.com/submit > auth_redirect() >
site.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=site.com/wp-admin/post.php ... and
there the init hook works

Any modification on this side ?
If not, do you have any idea of a sooner hook than init() ?

Thanks

Not that I am saying the Tango icons are a fit for WordPress, but just
showing an example of GPL projects using CC icons.

I hope, you understand. I think, the marign on bottom is to small,
when use a plugin or theme the hook in the footer.

Did you install any plugins, change your theme? It indeed would be  
very strange to have it change all by itself without you having done  
something.

You could try to alter the height of the footer element. Hook in some 
custom CSS into "admin_head" with something like

#footer {
    height: 100px;
}

or so.

I'm writing my first plugin (a filter) which is also one of my 
first PHP projects. I'm a bit confused over how my code works in 
WP and I assume I've missed something. After having stripped 
away all the code that actually did something I have a filter 
that returns the following text

<div><a href="xx"> <img src="yy" /> </a> text </div>

Which shows up the same way on the wordpress page source. But if 
I change this to

<div><a href="xx"> <img src="yy" /> </a> <p>text</p> </div>

then I get

<div><a href="xx"> <img src="yy" />  </a>
<p>text</p>
</p></div>

when I check the wordpress page source. As far as I understand 
WP seem to do some processing of the code I generate ... which 
in this case generates some faulty HTML code.

Can anyone please explain what is happening and what I can do to 
prevent the processing of the code I've generated

I think this not a realy god idea. It is easy to set a margin, not a
hight. Many Plugins use this hook and when the screen is small than it
this not cool, is very bad for readers. When you set a margin, then is
the design always equal.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Importer for loudblog with comments and enclosures
Message-ID: <20081027092516.207ca7e1@AG-P5K>

Hi,

i migrated our podcast from loudblog 0.7.1 to wordpress 2.6.3 and hacked a
importer for wp during that process.

The importer is based on the rss importer (/wp-admin/import/rss.php) that comes
with wp and additionally can create the comments and does handle the enclosure
(mp3) if the podpress plugin is installed with wordpress.

I wondered who maintains importers and where to send the new code for
inspection and maybe get it included into a future release to make live easier
for other people migration from loudblog.

Greetings & TIA

Hiya,

Create a new Ticket on Trac: http://trac.wordpress.org/ and attach a diff  
of trunk for consideration for 2.8 (too late in the 2.7 dev cycle to  
include new features)

Note that it'll need to be PHP 4.3+ compatible at present, If its not, not  
to worry, someone else might modify it to be compatible :)
(I only mention that, as another importer recently posted there is PHP5  
only)

As for the podPress support, Media handling is getting overhauled in 2.8,  
So it might be possible to support that (I doubt a core-included importer  
will handle plugins too.. but it depends on the implementation i guess)

Cheers,
Dion / DD32

I was thinking of it actually being compiled in, my apologies. Although,
it may depend on the FSF's interpretation of compiling.

Yes you're right. After a bit more experimentation I can see that it's  
the query->the_post() that's causing me problems. Presumably for that  
something like

if (have_posts()) {
   the_post();
   rewind_posts();
}

would bring the $post and the $id globals back to their previous  
values (and any others).

Or I'd imagine the alternative would be to place that at the start of  
any widget to make sure that it was dealing with the post being  
viewed. I had been taking a different approach, in that anything that  
changed the globals should clean up after itself.

Has anybody covered this sort of thing in how to write widgets? Most  
of the documentation I've been referring to has been about the Loop,  
and that advice might not be as appropriate in this case. Other than  
that it's been using the code in wp-includes/widgets.php, which is  
where I'd started with this thread. I'd be happy to help expand the  
codex on this topic - but as you can see I have some unknown areas.

BTW - thanks for all who have been replying.

Cheers

Nigel

CC-BY 2.5 (which Silk icons are licensed under) is GPL-incompatible,
as it has no guarantees of Freedom Zero in perpetuity.

IIRC, CC-BY-SA is the only (ONLY!) GPL-compatible version of CC
licenses, at least under the 2.5 regime.  Don't know if I recall if
the 3.0 revs fixed this...

No, *nothing* will bring the $post and $id globals back to their
previous values. There is no way to do that.

Nor should there be any way to do that, because those globals are only
valid values within the context of the Loop itself. If you're
expecting to be able to use a non-Loop function outside the Loop,
well, then this is the sort of problem you will encounter.

Don't use the_title() or the_content() or any Loop function outside of
an actual Loop... ever.

You're thinking that the globals should be reset, but the question
really is, reset *to what*? It doesn't make any sense to reset those,
because they are Loop globals. Outside the Loop their values are
undefined. So if you're using them, you're relying on a side effect,
which is obviously never a good thing to do.

In other words, what in the heck are you doing AFTER your loop that
requires those values in the first place? That's where the problem is.
You shouldn't be doing whatever that is.

CC-BY-SA is *not* GPL Compatible, and no, the 3.0 version has not
fixed that as of yet.

No CC license is GPL-Compatible, period.

Duh, you're right.  That's the exact article I was pulling some of my
info from, but my brain inverted the logic for CC-BY-SA for some
bizarre reason.

Carry on, good citizens, in your search for L/GPL icons.

That's a pretty good point. If there is something in your main/alt
loops that you need to have for later don't depend on the fact that wp
doesn't completely destroy the loop variables after the loop ends.
While you are in the loop save that data somewhere so that you can
call it.

For example, on our site we run a pre-loop that just shows posts with
the 'feature' category, and in the process we add the id's of shown
posts to a global array so that when we show the normal posts we can
check and make sure they weren't already shown as features. It is much
more sustainable to store things in a place you set explicitly rather
than depending on their shadows that hang round in $post or whatever.

In my experience problems with globals like $cat, $page etc all come
down to using query_posts() or the *OLD* get_posts() somewhere in your
templates. Find those and kill them ASAP (or at least query_posts() ).

Subject: [wp-hackers] Redirect and wp_validate_auth_cookie()
Message-ID: <KIENLALMFLNHHCHCADKIEEGCCEAA.daniel@kingubox.com>

Hello,

I would like redirect authors from login page to an admin panel different
from the default wordpress admin panel.

I've added a filter in login_redirect to change the 'redirect to' of these
users to a different folder from wp-admin (different name, but with the same
content). Something happens with cookies and 'wp_validate_auth_cookie()'
returns false when called from the files of the new folder and the user is
redirected to the login page.

Can you give me some track about what is happening with cookies?

Thank you very much..

Daniel

That's a possibility that could be used in WP. All that would need to be
done is to add a filter to the filenames and it should be doable.

Message-ID: <db047a770810280233p1b7ac11fjd21f19344728e0c6@mail.gmail.com>

A very nice feature of wordpress is to use the javascripts and
libraries of the core.
i include for a examble the thickbox-lib.

I have one problem - the image-path are not correctly

var tb_pathToImage = "../wp-includes/js/thickbox/loadingAnimation.gif";
var tb_closeImage = "../wp-includes/js/thickbox/tb-close.png";

Please it is possible to set the install-path with http:// - maybe
bloginfo('wpurl')
This is very easy and give many features for users to use the librarys.

Now i must set the vars in a script.

Thanks! and sorry for my bad english

I should perhaps add some more information, this is a new 
installation running WP 2.6.3, I've turned off all plugins 
except the one I'm trying to debug, I'm using the default theme.

The plugin code looks like this:

function jimagelinker( $content )
{
     return "<div><a href=\"xx\"> <img src=\"yy\" />  </a> 
<p>text</p> </div>";
}

add_filter ('the_content','jimagelinker',9);


Can anyone give a hint on why this is happening?

By default WordPress's "the_content" filter calls wpautop(), and
wpautop() adds line returns before every html tag that it considers a
block element, including "<p>".

OK, but what is causing the extra "</p>"?

Message-ID: <993ED82C-0056-49E2-B6FF-AC14C8BA6B90@striderweb.com>

Hi all --

Just a bit of code I came up with that I thought others might find  
handy.

function get_url_from_dir( $dir ) {
	$home = get_option('home');
	$parts = explode( '/', $home );
	$domain = implode( '/', array($parts[0], $parts[1], $parts[2]) );
	$url = $domain . str_replace( $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], '', $dir );
	return $url;
}

Basically, what this will do is take a path and give you the  
corresponding WP URL, e.g.:

WP_CONTENT_URL = get_url_from_dir( WP_CONTENT_DIR );

Regards,

Stephen

Subject: [wp-hackers] WP Roadmap Project
Message-ID: <4908DBA6.8040505@gaarai.com>

I'm currently working building what I hope will be a very valuable tool 
for many WordPress developers. The tentative name of it is WP Roadmap.

I often get frustrated when I can't find exactly the right action or 
filter hook to use for a specific task. I'll pick one hook, but it is 
activated too late. I'll pick another, and of course, it happens way too 
soon. I thought it would be great if I had a reliable means of tracking 
what happens in the execution of WordPress from start to finish to build 
a map of sorts. The Codex is great, but it is never completely accurate, 
often lags behind in terms of version compatibility, and doesn't 
accurately portray when events take place in relation to other events.

For this reason, I've decided to create WP Roadmap. The code that I've 
produced so far can track calls to add_filter, apply_filters, do_action, 
and do_action_ref_array functions as well as tracking include, 
include_once, require, and require_once calls. Not only does it track 
these individual calls, it also stores all the argument data that is 
passed with these calls and a full backtrace of each call. Each step of 
the backtrace also includes the function call, arguments, relevant 
class, source file, and line number. As you can imagine, the backtrace 
data is extremely large on a single page load, so I'm have a hard time 
finding out a way to represent this data.

The code and storage containers have the ability to generate roadmaps 
for specific pages and specific versions. I intend to generate roadmaps 
for most of the major versions (2.5+) and with a large number of page 
views for each version.

A quick sample of some of the data that this generates is provided 
below. Note that this is a very small sample of the total data set for 
the loading of the main page on 2.6.3 using the default template.

Function
	Name 	Argument Data 	Source File 	Line Number
require 	./wp-blog-header.php 	
	index.php 	18
require_once 	wp-load.php 	
	wp-blog-header.php 	12
require_once 	wp-config.php 	
	wp-load.php 	27
require_once 	wp-settings.php 	
	wp-config.php 	31
require_once 	wp-includes/wp-db.php 	
	wp-includes/functions.php 	2004
add_filter 	pre_term_name 	Array ( [0] => strip_tags [1] => 10 [2] => 
1 ) 	wp-includes/default-filters.php 	20
add_filter 	pre_term_name 	Array ( [0] => trim [1] => 10 [2] => 1 ) 
wp-includes/default-filters.php 	21
add_filter 	pre_term_name 	Array ( [0] => wp_filter_kses [1] => 10 [2] 
=> 1 ) 	wp-includes/default-filters.php 	22


My very early front-end to present this data has the ability to 
selectively show/hide information based upon the primary function type. 
I intend to add many filters to make it easy to find the data that 
people are looking for quickly and easily.

If you are interested in this project or have any suggestions/comments, 
please let me know. If you've read all of this, thank you for your time.

G'day,

This sounds like an immensely useful tool.

In terms of navigating the data, here's a few random suggestions...

* Show the list of files as they're included
* Allow an "ajax" delve into each file, to see the function calls
* Provide "more info" on each function, again some form of ajax load

It would be great to create a fluid, dynamic interface so you feel like
you're exploring the code visually. Diving into each section, seeing
more info, zooming back out. Something like a Google Maps type
interface.

It's quite pie in the sky, but I think the map analogy is good.
Different zoom levels, different navigation methods, show / hide various
overlays, etc.

Is there an announce mailing list or RSS feed I can subscribe to for
updates? I'm not always that active on wp-hackers.

Cheers - Callum.

Subject: [wp-hackers] requesting information about wp_*_style functions
Message-ID: <93c3fbd10810291907u62d1b5c3v3e05767877300c@mail.gmail.com>

I want to be able to write a file called tweaks.css, place it any theme's
directory and use it to tweak styles for plugins that don't match the theme
very well, or for minor theme tweaks to the theme itself. To be able to
overwrite the styles that are loaded by other things I need it to be linked
last in the pages head.

This is the code that I've come up with for this. It seems to work, but I
feel like this is not quite right. Could somebody let me know if I've done
this right and maybe send me a link or explain the proper way to do this?

Thanks in advance for any help with this, it is greatly appreciated. :)


// Include a link to tweaks.css if it exists in the current templates
directory...
function krusty_plugstyles(){
    if(file_exists(get_template_directory()) . '/tweaks.css'){
        wp_register_style('krusted-plugstyles', get_bloginfo('template_url')
. '/tweaks.css', array(), '', 'screen');
        wp_enqueue_style('krusted-plugstyles');
        wp_print_styles('krusted-plugstyles');
    }
}

// add an action when wordpress loads a pages 'head', use '100' in hopes
that this will be the last thing to run.
add_action('wp_head', 'krusty_plugstyles', '100');

I think that doing both wp_enqueue_style and wp_print_styles 
back-to-back is a bit unnecessary. Here's some code that I ripped from 
wp-includes/general-template.php which shows how determining whether to 
enqueue or print is appropriate:

if ( $force_echo || did_action( 'wp_print_styles' ) ) // we already printed the style queue.  Print this one immediately

    wp_print_styles( $handle );

else // Add to style queue

    wp_enqueue_style( $handle );


Since you are using the function on a wp_head action, you might as well 
just forget about queuing it since the queue won't be used any longer. 
Of course, you could always latch into the "admin_print_styles" or 
"wp_print_styles" actions as appropriate and enqueue your stylesheet 
rather than calling the wp_print_styles function directly.

I'm not sure why wp_print_styles() is not called automatically. So my
approach is normally like this.

function krusty_init(){
    if(file_exists(get_template_directory()) . '/tweaks.css'){
        wp_enqueue_style('krusted-plugstyles',
get_bloginfo('template_url')
. '/tweaks.css', array(), '', 'screen');
    }
    add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles');
}
add_action('init', 'krusty_init');

I reckon wp_print_styles should be called at wp_head anyway, so I
typically hook it in there, and then use it as I would use the
wp_*_script functions.

Cheers - Callum.

A while back I was trying to track the specific order of actions and  
filters.  (Working on a plugin).  I hacked the core files and added an  
error_log() to the beginning of the do_action filter, telling me which  
action/filter was just called.

Worked like a champ -- answered my question in about 30 seconds of  
work rather than combing through the files tracing the execution  
order....

Your project sounds like a very neat idea.  Mine was just quick -n-  
dirty.  :)

I tried playing around with those, but I could not get it to work. After
reading this:

I searched through the source code, it seems that every instance that I can
find of wp_print_styles() being called is somewhere on the admin pages. My
guess is that it is left to theme authors to impliment it in their themes
so, I decided to try what Callum suggested with this:


>    add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles');


embedded in the function. What I have now is the following:

 // Include a link to the current templates tweaks.css if it exists...
function krusty_plugstyles(){
    if (file_exists (get_template_directory()) . '/tweaks.css'){
        // register and enqueue our css for later addition into the head of
the page
        wp_register_style('krusted-plugstyles', get_bloginfo('template_url')
. '/tweaks.css', array(), '', 'screen');
        wp_enqueue_style('krusted-plugstyles');

        // since wp_print_styles() doesn't seem to run by default
        // we add a call to it with the wp_head action hook
        add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles', '100');
    }
}

// add an action to call our function when wordpress starts loading a page
add_action('init', 'krusty_plugstyles');

This seems to be working, but now I'm left wondering if I should use a
conditional on it, maybe something like:

if ( !did_action( 'wp_print_styles'  )
     add_action ( 'wp_head, 'wp_print_styles', '100' );

or would that even be worth it?

Thanks for the help folks, I do appreciate it alot! :)

Is it available for download somewhere, if it's doing what i think it's
doing them I would love to use/test it and would be more than willing to
give (hopefully) constructive feedback about my experiences with it...

DOLP!!

I found a couple of big blunders in the cade I posted before...

First, this line is wrong, if I'm looking at the parentheses right then that
would always evaluate to true as the template directory would always exist.
Unless you've deleted it without changing themes, but even then it would
change to the default and probably still be true...

    if (file_exists (get_template_directory()) . '/tweaks.css'){
>

Also, the calls to template functions will not work correctly if you are
using a 'child theme'. I've fixed them with stylesheet stuff instead, now
what I have looks like this:

<?php

// Include a link to the current templates tweaks.css if it exists...
function krusty_plugstyles(){
    if(file_exists(STYLESHEETPATH . '/tweaks.css')){
        // register and enqueue our css for later addition into the head of
the page
        wp_register_style('krusted-plugstyles',
get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/tweaks.css', array(), '', 'screen');
        wp_enqueue_style('krusted-plugstyles');

        // since wp_print_styles() doesn't seem to run by default
        // we add a call to it with the wp_head action hook
        add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles', '100');
    }
}

// add an action to call our function when wordpress starts loading a page
add_action('init', 'krusty_plugstyles');

?>

I'm still wondering if I should use a conditional on the wp_head ation or
not though...

Thanks again for the help :)

Just a FYI:
As of WordPress 2.7, The Print styles hook is included in core for  
front-end requests too:
http://trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-includes/default-filters.php#L165

add_action('wp_head', 'rsd_link');
add_action('wp_head', 'wlwmanifest_link');
add_action('wp_head', 'locale_stylesheet');
add_action('publish_future_post', 'check_and_publish_future_post', 10, 1);
add_action('wp_head', 'noindex', 1);
add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles', 9);
add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_scripts');
add_action('wp_head', 'wp_generator');

Ahh... So the conditional would probably be a good idea then. If I'm
thinking strait then this:

        if ( !did_action( 'wp_print_styles' ))
            add_action( 'wp_head', 'wp_print_styles', '100');

would cause my code to only add the action if wp_print_styles has not
already been called... Or would it be better to use a version check and hook
into wp_print_styles?

You know you could have just used the "all" hook...

add_action( 'all', 'action_debug', 10, 100 );
function action_debug() {
    echo current_filter() . ' is currently being run and is being passed ' .
func_num_args() . " arguments.\n";
}

G'day,

Calling wp_print_styles() multiple times won't print the styles multiple
times, so it's not too much of a concern.

I wonder what will yield better performance, double calling it, or
calling the did_action() function. Personally, I'd probably double call
and then discard it once we go to 2.7, but then I'm not big on backwards
compatibility. :)

Cheers - Callum.

add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles_check', 10);
function wp_print_styles_check() {
    if ( !did_action( 'wp_print_styles' ))
        wp_print_styles();
}


Although I'd personally do a version check instead of did_action() on the
off-chance that a plugin needed to remove wp_print_styles from the wp_head
hook for some reason.

I thought of doing that, but it really wouldn't offer exactly what I 
need. If I implemented this hook via a plugin, it would miss a number of 
calls by the time it gets loaded. In order to ensure that it gets in 
first, I would have to modify the core files. Since I'm already 
modifying the core files, why not track things that could not possibly 
be tracked without modifying the core code (such as includes and 
requires)? This way, I get a full start to finish view of what is 
happening rather than just a collection of action and filter calls.

Of course it could still be argued that seeing so far back into the 
execution of the code is pointless since a plugin or theme would never 
have the ability to interact at that level. I still would like to know 
where how all the different pieces come together. Furthermore, you never 
know when there will be someone that wants to actually modify the core 
for whatever reason.

I don't think that I will be releasing any downloads. I'm having a hard 
enough time trying to figure out how to display and filter the data for 
quick loading and efficiency of searching as is. I suppose that I could 
just dump a number of CSV files for people to sort through, but that 
wouldn't be very valuable for many people.

You message did get me thinking about the possibility of generating a 
tree node style image from the data for each version. That could be 
pretty cool.

I'm pretty sure there aren't any hooks before plugins are loaded. As you
said, what would be the point of having them there if nothing could make use
of them?

As for includes/requires, PHP has you covered -- no core editing required:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-included-files.php

You still haven't offered a valid reason of why this couldn't just be a
couple line plugin. :P

For what it's worth, my plugin (wp-hive) interacts with WP well before conventional plugins are loaded by using a feature in 2.5 that calls /wp-content/db.php, if it exists. 

I agree that seeing these early calls would be quite worthwhile.

Ahh... I was thinking of the code to run on a local WordPress install, now
I'm thinking, (or maybe hoping), that you plan on making this into an
informational site or something along those lines. That would be cool too.

If you were doing this as a searchable website of information then this
could be very cool. I'm not a great programmer, I've only learned the bits
I've needed here and there, but I have tried a couple of times to figure out
what WP is doing by looking through source code... I always start loosing
track after about ten or so pages of includes. It ould be great if there
were a place I could go and click through the different branches to help get
a grip on it. Especially if you could follow it through different types of
pages and things like that...

As it turns out, the current wordpress-mu trunk has $wp_version = '2.7', and
$wpmu_version = '2.7-bleeding-edge' but does not include the call to
wp_print_styles in the wp_head action. I'm hoping that is just a temporary
oversight, or a lag in incorporating new code into wpmu, but it slightly
complicates the idea of using version_compare()

Or, I could just be really tired right now and should maybe look at it again
when I have slept..?

Once again Viper, you have great information. Thus one of the many 
reasons why I always read messages you send on the list.

I suppose I haven't made a very good case for what I'm working on right 
now; you're right about that. I'll see if I can't justify what I'm doing.

If you want to see the very rough front-end that I've put together, you 
can find it at (http://new.gaarai.com/roadmap/). I've only generated a 
few page views on 2.6.3 as of now, I'm not displaying any backtrace 
information, some of the stored data needs a lot of clean up, and the 
presentation leaves a lot to be desired, but it should give you a taste 
of what I'm going for. Also, some of the line numbers are going to be 
slightly off. I'm getting that fixed up currently.

Currently, I intend to offer the following with WP Roadmap:

    * A full list of all page includes (include, require, etc) combined
      with other relevant function calls in their order of execution.
    * Provide detailed information at each roadmap entry. This
      information includes the source file containing the call, the line
      number, the arguments passed to the function, and a full backtrace
      on each call.
    * Be able to select an entry in the roadmap to pull up the full
      source-code listing that automatically scrolls down to the
      specific line of code and highlights it. This would be invaluable
      to quickly figure out how the WP core coding team did it.
    * Provide this information on any WordPress version with a large
      selection of specific page views. The execution stack changes from
      version to version and page view to page view. Providing
      information about the specific differences of the execution stack
      can quickly provide needed information on why a certain hook
      doesn't work properly on a specific page view or version.
    * All the core customizations are done via a script and not by hand.
      I also intend to write a script that can automate all the page
      views. This means that I will be able to install a newly-released
      version, add the roadmap code, and traverse all the page views to
      generate the data moments after the new version is released. In
      other words, this would be a very reliable source of information
      about any potential changes in new releases.

Here are some other ideas of what I would like to create if I can and 
have time to:

    * A backtrace source view. This would be similar to the source view
      mentioned before except that it would pull out complete functions
      from the source of each backtrace step in order to give a quick
      code view from start to finish for specific points of execution.
      Each point along the backtrace execution path will be highlighted
      for quickly tracking the calls.
    * I mentioned before that I would like to create a generated tree
      image of the calls. I think producing a number of different
      quick-reference cards from this data could be beneficial for many
      developers.
    * A version compare ability. This would allow you to quickly see the
      differences of the execution stacks between two versions. Out of
      all the ideas that I have, I think that this will be the most
      difficult to implement. Anyone have experience with generating
      difference sets?

I know that not all of this information will be useful or relevant to 
every programmer. I do think that all the information will have value to 
someone however. One of my frustrations with the documentation that 
currently exists is that it is typically either inaccurate or 
insufficient for my specific needs. This results in me going to the 
command line and doing a series of grep queries to find what files I 
need to look through and then wading through a sea of code. If I could 
have a tool that would give me quick access to detailed information from 
the surface level down to the deep internals, I wouldn't have to spend 
so much time searching through code.

I wouldn't be able to generate a reliable execution stack, backtraces, 
or version-specific and page-specific data without modifying the core or 
by using a plugin. I'm not sure if I've provided sufficient reason for 
you to think that this tool should exist. I know that I will find this 
tool very valuable, and as such, I'm sure that others will find value in 
it as well.

Just as a side note to this whole discussion, there is an overview 
article that might help you understand the core mechanics of WordPress at:
    http://codex.wordpress.org/Query_Overview

Obviously, this article doesn't try to have the level of detail of 
this WP Roadmap Project. When that project gets to the point of being 
a useful tool, it would be good to link the article to the Roadmap site.

I'm very pleased to report that WP Roadmap now has it's own site. Please 
visit wp-roadmap.com <http://wp-roadmap.com/> to check it out. I added a 
subscribe feature for those that want to keep up with updates on the 
project.

Since the site, and the project itself, is very new, the site looks very 
rough and the front-end is still in a very early alpha stage. If you 
have any ideas on how to improve the look of the site, want to volunteer 
to help out with the project in any capacity, or have any ideas, please 
share them.

Some people seem to be a bit confused about how WP Roadmap will work. 
The project will be wholly contained on the site. I have no plans 
currently on releasing any downloadable documents (other than the 
possible images that I've talked about) or plugins, but you never know 
what the future brings. Also, yes, the site is and always will be free 
to use as well as open to the public.

Sorry for sending my reply to the list. He previously sent me a private

For the record, I'm not trying to say your work is unjustified or anything
like that -- docs are always awesome. I just think code 24/7 and like
debating different methods of accomplishing tasks via PHP. That's all.

Keep up the awesome work. :)

It's likely that WPMU just hasn't synced up with regular WP yet. That
usually happens after regular WP goes gold.

I'm fairly sure this won't cause any problems:
add_action('wp_head', 'wp_print_styles');

Worst case scenario, it'll be called twice on 2.7. But that won't output
the styles twice. The overhead will be minimal.

Cheers - Callum.

Great idea. I thought about doing that also. I'll send you a picture of

Open a file, write one line, save, and go.

vs.

Create a new file, fill in headers, write the function and hook, go  
into admin and activate, and go.


Oh, and an error in my statement below.  I added an error_log to the  
do_action() **function**, not filter.

Message-ID: <743f2e480810302227o4cb842a0m394995a6aa68e8e2@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening list,

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, as I am new to this list
this week but interested in contributing to WordPress.  I'd like to
start my contribution by addressing the issues that have effected me
during the creation and set up of my blog using WordPress.  I have had
a look round the developer documentation on the WordPress site and I
did not see a how to get started guide so I thought I would start with
a suggested change.

What is the procedure for submitting changes to the TinyMCE editor?
I'm a fan of the google syntax highlighter library
(http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) and use it on my blog
but I've noticed that TinyMCE is stripping the name tag out of the PRE
elements that are used to identify the code for the highlighter
library.  After a bit of searching around the internet I came across
the following suggested fix, which involves editing the Tags TinyMCE
is stripping:
     http://ellisweb.net/2008/08/using-syntaxhighlighter-to-format-code-in-wordpress/
I'd like to know if this sort of fix would be considered acceptable
thing to resolve (it does not have to be the solution used in the
article) to roll into the main code base or not?

Cheers,

Daniel

Hello,

please it is possible to set a margin to img in the menu?
I add a icon to all my plugins for the new menu and i must set a
inline-style for a small distance.

Maybe you can set a margin of 3px on img in the menu?
#adminmenu .wp-submenu img {
	margin-right: 3px;
}

Thanks!

You'd probably want to submit that to the TinyMCE bugtracker and get it  
fixed upstream there, When they make their next release, It'll then get  
included into WordPress

which involves editing the Tags TinyMCE is stripping:
 
http://ellisweb.net/2008/08/using-syntaxhighlighter-to-format-code-in-wordpr
ess/
I'd like to know if this sort of fix would be considered acceptable thing to
resolve (it does not have to be the solution used in the
article) to roll into the main code base or not?

Cheers,

Daniel

TinyMCE is an open source project, http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/

Yes, TinyMCE produces XHTML 1.0 strict output and "name" is an invalid 
attribute for the <pre> tag.

If you want to use this syntax highlighter, a better/easier option would 
be to install one of the WordPress plugins that include it.

Just for the sake of attribution, it should be pointed out that that  
isn't the "Google" Syntax Highlighter library, it's a project owned by  
Alex Gorbatchev that just happens to be hosted at Google Code, which  
anyone can use. :)

As long as the priority, action and callback are the same, it won't add
it twice, but rather it will simply overwrite the first. (Unless, of
course, it doesn't work the way I think it does from memory.)

Hi -

I am trying to write a very simple code/script to auto-generate
holiday logos for my site. In this connection, I am looking for some
documentation on how tags such as is_day() work (Currently there is
virtually no usable documentation available: viz., parameters, and
examples, in particular.)

Could someone please help?

Chetan,

I love doing the holiday logos myself and having to do it manually is a 
pain. Let me look into it, but that's a good place to test it out. :)

Also, these would be the wrong functions to use to determine what the
current day is (which is what I assume you want for "holiday logos").

For that, you would use simple PHP code:
http://php.net/manual/en/function.getdate.php

Example:

$today = getdate();
if ($today["mon"] == 12 && $today["mday"] == 25) echo "Merry Xmas!";

Shane, Otto -

Thanks.

Ah, I noticed that is_day is archive based not really meant for specific dates.

This is not really a bug per se, though.
It is possible to allow the name attribute of pre tags through TinyMCE's 
code cleanup filter.

The "extended_valid_elements" option of the TinyMCE init object needs to 
include the following:
pre[name]

Now, Wordpress builds the TinyMCE init through PHP, and provides a 
number of actions and filters for plugins to alter it. Off the top of my 
head, I couldn't tell you what the correct action or filter would be to 
add this, but I'm sure someone else could, or it would be very easy to 
find out. The file in which all this happens lives in 
wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_config.php.

Good luck.

Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone who uses sociable has noticed this, it's had
me a little puzzled... Any time someone views a post that includes the
sociable tagline, it looks like a request is made to
wp-content/plugins/sociable/images/ ... My error log is littered with
lines like this:

Directory index forbidden by Options directive:
/site/wp-content/plugins/sociable/images/

I'm not sure why this is happening, and I've been unable to find any
answers from googling or even contacting the author several times. Any
ideas? This is more of a curiosity thing... The plugin seems to work
fine despite this error.

Daniel

Subject: [wp-hackers] Loops and Cloning 
Message-ID: <F0947C22-B4EC-40CD-8ACA-824C1E3FAA81@funroe.net>

I'm sharing because I totally ripped this off from drupal and I feel  
guilty for it :)

The problem I had was a multiple loop in a template for a theme that  
displayed posts by a custom field category. Everything worked fine but  
I forgot that I not only have to clone or duplicate the orginal $post,  
but also the $wp_query. I only noticed it because the page menus with  
wp_list_pages lost the current_page CSS classes. Buried in  
wp_list_pages is a global $wp_query.

Moving the original code from an old php4 box to a php5 box really  
hated me. So I dug around and found a nice compatibility wrapper  
function for cloning and duplication of objects from drupal. Don't  
feed it anything but an "object" though...

Happy Halloween!
Jess

-- Helper function to clone objects for php4 and php5

function wp_clone($object) {
   return version_compare(phpversion(), '5.0') < 0 ? $object :  
clone($object);
}

--- A snip of theme template code --

<?php
if ( ( $page_category_name =  
get_post_custom_values( 'page_category' ) ) ) {
	
	// duplicate post and wp_query for later recovery	
	$temp_wp_query = wp_clone( $wp_query );
	$temp_post = wp_clone( $post );

	// set $more to 0 for more links
	global $more;
	$more = 0;
	
	query_posts( 'category_name=' . $page_category_name[0] .  
'&showposts=' . get_option('posts_per_page') );
?>

do loop stuff...

<?php
	// recover post and wp_query
	$post = wp_clone( $temp_post );
	$wp_query = wp_clone( $temp_wp_query );

} // end if ( ( $page_category_option =  
get_post_custom_values( 'page_category' ) ) )
?>
