Ah, paging. Of course.

I'll try and switch to that plugin. Wish I'd asked sooner! :-\

Many thanks,

Steve

Hmmm. For one my sites, I have posts tagged with the 5 digit zip code 
of the location that the event took place. Will this issue bite me 
once one of those tags has more than 10 tagged posts? Right now, it 
looks like the tag pages are working correctly. Thanks, Mike

I'm building a site for a client that is primarily in WordPress but 
contains a donation section built with the PHP framework Yii.

Visually, when a user is on the donation page(s), I'd like to still show 
the sidebar and footer from the main WordPress blog to maintain 
consistency. But, obviously, I can't simply include those php files or 
call get_sidebar() from another application.

I know there are several ways to accomplish what I'm wanting: I could 
use ajax, e.g. $.load(), or create a page template and file($url), but 
I'm looking for a better (and faster) way. I'm wondering if other folks 
have encountered this issue, and what they have done.

If no good solutions exist, I might just write a plugin that caches 
theme parts periodically or after certain updates are made.

Any advice?

Tags and categories have base prefixes, like /catgeory/bob or /tag/fred. The
numeric slug problem does not apply.

Make a page template and include the Yii base code in that. Then use that
page template on a WP page.

Otto, I haven't tried that so I can't confirm, but that sounds like it 
would almost certainly cause problems. Both Yii and WordPress use 
htaccess rewrite rules, both use a custom URL structure, and I believe 
both use cookies/sessions. It just seems like that would get real messy, 
real fast.

And what about a situation where the other pages aren't being built with 
PHP? I've had similar issues when building applications with a coworker 
who uses WebObjects (Java).

Is this not something anyone here has really had to deal with? It seems 
to me like it would come up frequently.

WordPress is heavily dependent on the rest of WordPress for page
generation.  There is no simple way to separate out functionality such
as just rendering the sidebar or just rendering the footer without
loading the rest of WordPress.

Attempting to try loading it into java would just be ridiculous.  How
would you plan on executing PHP code outside of using PHP? Trying to
load it into another PHP application may be possible, but as you point
out it has the potential to cause issues.  In the end, if you want to
use WordPress then why just not use WordPress, or write the
functionality you want from WordPress in whatever other application
you insist upon using.

I guess technically you could create pages in WordPress and assign a
page template to it, call the page sidebar and create a page template
that only displayed the sidebar and assign it to your page.  Then you
could do some sort of HTTP request to that page in WP, and inject the
HTML into your other page powered by some other app.  But that sounds
like shaving the corners off of the square peg to make it fit into the
round hole instead of just using the round peg.  At that point why not
just use WP?

Message-ID: <AANLkTim3D98BeZ2xR+3zDrhX48Vh0pDnoSmBYjnVW0_7@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

I'm not sure if it's the correct list to ask this question, if I'm not in
the correct place please tell.

I notice something strange in my new WP3.1 installation, for example the
title of my post is:

*Vocabulaire - D?couvrir les noms - Guide du ma?tre*

and in the blog the title is transform to:

*8211; D?couvrir les noms - Guide du ma?tre*

I fix that with this function:

function cleanWPMess($content)
{
$content = str_replace(array("&#8211;"), "-", $content);
return $content;
}
add_filter('the_title', 'cleanWPMess');
add_filter('the_content', 'cleanWPMess');
add_filter('the_excerpt', 'cleanWPMess');

but I wonder why WP do that.

If it were up to me, I'd just use WordPress, but quite often it's not 
just up to me. When you get hired to incorporate a blog into an existing 
site, you just have to play the hand you've been dealt.

Perhaps I'm not doing a very good job of explaining myself. Imagine I've 
created a WordPress theme with a footer that displays a list of all the 
pages in that site. Then someone else creates another web app for the 
same domain that wants to use my footer. Obviously you can't just take a 
snapshot of the footer because it will change every single time a new 
page is added.

Here is my idea: create a plugin that makes an ajax request to the home 
page every time a page is saved to the database. That ajax request would 
parse the document for the footer based on a CSS/jQuery selector, 
perhaps "#footer", and then save the returned markup as a .html file on 
the server. Then, in the other application, the code could simply 
include that .html file and be fairly certain it's exactly the same as 
what's on the home page.

It seems a little hackish, but I can't really think of a better idea. 
Anyone?

Eh, not that hackish, I've done this (or variations of this) before. On
save_post (post_type != 'revision') or publish_post or what works for you,
do a wp_remote_request() to the front page, grab the footer, and save it to
disk, or a transient, or what have you.

Hi,

I have rewritten my proposal, and I would like to see if there is any
interest for it. I published it on a blog, since I am using drawings to
clarify some things. The website is www.thomasvaneyck.com.

Thanks you!

Thomas

You could do:

require_once "path-to-wordpress/wp-load.php";
get_sidebar();

Hi there. It is expected that students will take the initiative to 
follow the links from our organizational profile on the GSoC site to see 
our Ideas page, which lists a number of potential project ideas as well 
as who our mentors are this year. There is a wealth of information 
already posted online. Please try again.

Ideally, the student will work with the WordPress UI group on it.

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSOC - just some ideas for students
Message-ID: <4D96E1BE.2080508@mrhead.sk>

Hello Hackers, Hello Students!

To be honest, I did not read all the GSOC posts from this list because I 
did not have time. So I don't know if I can propose some ideas or not, 
but i will try.

I have some ideas for image managing mainly for UI, but also something 
for programmers:

1) Meta box for images in edit post screen. This is based on experiences 
of different users. Now when you have attached 20 images to post and you 
want to include each image to different position in text you need at 
least 6 clicks for each image: Upload icon, gallery link (attached 
images), choose image, choose align, choose size, and insert into post. 
With 20 images this take a lot of time and also you are still opening 
thickbox window...

The idea is to make meta box with images thumbnails. You just click on 
thumbnail, choose size, align, maybe also caption and just drag and drop 
image to the text. After drop there will be html added to text.

This will save a lot of time (and nerves) for users who needs to work 
with more images... As i said this is real world example from my 
clients. They like WordPress, but they don't like inserting images, 
because it is complicated.

This meta box can also include icons for file upload... Currently icons 
are available only if editor is available for post type. Sometimes I 
don't need editor for some post types, but i need possibility to add 
files...

2) New image size handling. In present you can set three image sizes in 
admin panel. But just these three and they are also valid for all post 
types. But with custom post types it is not good solution. Example from 
my site: I have regular posts where i need just one image size. I have 
pictures published by users where i need 3 custom image size. I have 
galleries again with different sizes.

I know that i can add image size with add_image_size, but this is not 
good. Because it is valid for all post sizes. So know i use 
wp_generate_attachment_metadata filter to generate needed sizes for 
gallery...

I have more ideas how to solve this:
- add another parameter post_type to add_image_size so only images for 
given post_type will be resized
- add possibility to specify image sizes with add_post_type_support ? or 
directly within register_post_type ?
- add possibility to manage all post type image sizes directly from admin

These were just me ideas. As i said i don't know if they can be used in 
GSOC or not, but i think that especially first one will be valuable to 
users. I know that it can be done by plugin, but it would be nice to 
have it in core.

Many thanks

Patrik

And one other thing that I've forgot.

Maybe it would be also good idea to have tags for media. Attachment is 
also post (id DB), so there should be no problem. Only what is needed is 
to make UI for it.

With tags user can easily find their files...

Hi everyone,

I am pleased to inform that I wrote a small plugin today and have put
up the code here.http://anirudhspider.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/wp-
facts/
Hoping for hosting access in Wordpress soon.

I am posting this information in this thread to inform everyone that I
have updated my proposal with this recent development. I have not
received any feedback for my proposal though and would like to get
some soon.

My proposal is over here. http://anirudhspider.wordpress.com/project-idea-for-gsoc-2011/

Thank you for your valuable time.

Cheers,
Anirudh

Hi,
My name is Fernando Briano and I've developed a couple of plugins and 
contributed code to other hackers' plugins. I have some free time I 
would like to use contributing code to WordPress. I'm not a PHP guru, 
but I've had some experience and I would like to learn more and 
contribute by helping WordPress.

I've been to the "needs patch" trac report looking for some small task 
to start with. Do you think 9777 is a good ticket to start with? It 
seems simple, and not too hard to code.

If there's any recommended place / task for me to start, or if anyone is 
needing help on some coding task, please let me know.

Regards

Message-ID: <BANLkTini7xmAQutiWE2K_qxpZF3Rx38xxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

This is the first go for me in the Summer of Code. I've been working with
WordPress for a really long time. My website/portfolio is powered by
WordPress (http://www.amitspsworld.info) and I create themes for making a
few extra bucks.

Since I've been working mainly on Portfolio based blog themes, this idea
struck me. Since almost every blog out there needs a contact page, why not
implement a template for a contact page within the dashboard? There could be
simple drag and drop features by which the fields of the contact form can be
modified.

Waiting for you valuable comments.

Yours sincerely,

Amit

Great, thanks!
The ticket is tagged with dev-feedback and ux-feedback. Who should I ask

I know Debian offers a package with tools to simplify WordPress

We're not sure yet if we want to keep links as a custom post type or remove
them completely (leaving only a simple Links widget).

In either case, it would be good to have a plugin that does this (importing
the links table into wp_posts and providing the same interface, as the
current link manager). Later, it can either be included into core or point
users to it when the release is made.

So, maybe you should work on such a plugin. Feel free to open a ticket to
track your progress on this, if you want.

It's not very clear to me what you mean by that. By 'dashboard', do you mean
admin area?

Like the Contact Form 7 plugin does?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Placing a guest author custom field
Message-ID: <4D9919EE.7040105@yahoo.com>

I'm trying to place a Guest Author field (as described at 
wpbeginners.com) in my index.php and single.php templates. I inserted 
some code in functions.php:

|// guest author custom field
add_filter( 'the_author', 'guest_author_name' );
add_filter( 'get_the_author_display_name', 'guest_author_name' );

function guest_author_name( $name ) {
global $post;

$author = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'guest-author', true );

if ( $author )
$name = $author;

return $name;
}|


I edited my index.php and single.php templates to replace this:

|<?php the_author();?>|


with this:

|<?phpechoget_post_meta($post->ID,'guest-author',true);?>
|

This works fine when I select the custom field and fill in a guest 
author's name. But if I don't use a custom field because I'm publishing 
my own post, the author's name is left blank on the blog!

What am I missing here?

Thanks.

If you include the add_filter +   guest_author_name code in your themes
functions.php file, you shouldn't have to change the_author() to
get_post_meta()...

The way the filter code works, if is you have assigned a guest name, it
overrides the output of the_author() to that of the guest, otherwise
displays the "normal" author name.

Well, whataya know. Thanks, Dion!

This is a great routine to add if you want to credit one-time guest 
authors with proper bylines.

So far no more feedback. Does that mean there is not interest for it, or
that its more or less ok? :-) What is the next step? I finalize the
proposal. How about a mentor? Who does most of the work on the WP UI?

Thanks,

Subject: [wp-hackers] Shortcode to call comments_template();
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=C+D8_+WgmcT8z+m3T3XSdVvH3-Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm attempting to call the comments_template(); function in a shortcode.
Basically I want to call the comments template ONLY on a certain posts.
Below is the shortcode function I wrote.  Everything works but the
comments_template.


function sword_comment_shortcode($sword_comment_atts) {
  return '<h2 class="ltcol tk-league-gothic">I know you thought this was
great, others will too.</h2>
                   <article class="rtcol" ><span
class=\'st_facebook_vcount\' st_title=\'{TITLE}\' st_url=\'{URL}\'
displayText=\'share\'></span><span class=\'st_twitter_vcount\'
st_title=\'{TITLE}\' st_url=\'{URL}\' displayText=\'share\'></span><span
class=\'st_linkedin_vcount\' st_title=\'{TITLE}\' st_url=\'{URL}\'
displayText=\'share\'></span>
                            </article>
                        <div class="clear"></div>
                         <h2 class="ltcol tk-league-gothic">Share Your
Thoughts!</h2>
                   <article class="rtcol" >';

  comments_template();

  return '</article>
  <div class="clear"></div>';

 }
 add_shortcode('comments-shareit', 'sword_comment_shortcode');

Well first things first, your callback function is going to basically
exit after the first return and never meet the comments_template()
call, since you are doing a return before you run that function.

The next step would be to attend an IRC chat this week, if you have
questions:

https://wpdevel.wordpress.com/ (you should really subscribe to that blog)

Haha, wow, I should be going to bed when that happens (late night).  Thanks
that immediately fixed it.

Now the comments are coming in above the content in the post.  I have a few
paragraphs of content then at the bottom is the shortcode.  However when you
view the post it has the comments above everything else.  Any idea why?

For starters shortcodes need to return, and comments_template does an
include() which is basically echoing.  Likely the only way you will
get it to work is to output buffer it, put the output into a var and
then add it to the return.  Of course this will increase memory usage,
and blah blah blah...Don't feel like typing any more, but you likely
know of the down falls of output buffering, but it is likely your only
option here.

Right, trying to call comments_template inside the shortcode just
isn't going to work.

Instead, why not have the comments shortcode set a global variable,
then base your call to comments_template later in the code based on
that global variable. Like this:

function sword_comment_shortcode($sword_comment_atts) {
global $sword_do_comments;
$sword_do_comments = true;
}
add_shortcode('comments-shareit', 'sword_comment_shortcode');

... later ...

if ($sword_do_comments) {
 comments_template();
}

Well, a little simpler. Like in the widgets area where you can drop widgets,
you can drop fields into the form.

MailPress do that already, and is more beautiful than contact form 7 way,
have you looked at?

This is really a support question so it should have been asked on the

WordPress won't do that but something in your theme, plugins, or custom
functions may be the cause.
What WordPress is seeing, for some reason, is " - D?couvrir les noms - Guide
du ma?tre" instead of "Vocabulaire - D?couvrir les noms - Guide du ma?tre".
Because it is seeing the dash in front of D?couvrir les noms it is encoding
it as the HTML entity for a dash. &#8211; is the entity that means the same
thing as &ndash;
What you need to do is to look at what is stripping out the first word of
your title. The most likely culprit is an SEO function that changes the
titles.

Lynne

Subject: [wp-hackers] GSoC 2011 Project Idea
Message-ID: <BANLkTimnAP1kpDifq1Pge2-s7PcHX8fvTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm looking forward for doing a project in GSoC 2011.
Propoal 1

The idea for my project is to bring bbPress from standalone to plugin
for the WordPress installation. As far as the news from WordPress
plugin repository, the plugin bbPress is still in alpha stage. So by
this proposal I'm planning to import all the current functionalities
in the standalone version to the plugin and improve the existing
functionalities and making a import script from standalone script to
the plugin powered forum on wordpress installation.

Proposal 2
If time permits or else the first idea is already on the move, I'd
like to work with bbxf for improving and implementing it to the
bbPress standalone/plugin for WordPress.
Sad to know that the bbxf domain <http://bbxf.org> is not working. I
hope you guys will look forward to the domain issue.


So this is the idea for the GSoC from me to implement. Looking forward
for your valuable feedbacks.

Thanks,
Arjun S Kumar

Have you attempted to use the bbPress Plugin to see where it stands in
development?
AFAIK, there isn't a proper importer script for it yet.
You can find the plugin here:

In my opinion, A importer from the Standalone to the Plugin would be first
priority.
I don't know enough details about the bbPress plugin to give any rock solid
advice on it however, I'd suggest investigating whats around, and if you're
interested in doing something thats not available yet, write up a proposal
for it.

@Dion
Thanks. So i guess as per the trac of bbPress there are some
functionalities to be imported to plugin from standalone. So would
suggest an importer and extend the functionalities.

Thanks for your time.

JJJ was also talking about:
* thread tools (for merging/splitting)
* complete theme support (both UI and UX, some JavaScript/AJAX would
great too)
* tags part
* some old api compatibility to ensure basic support for older plugins
* some lack of important plugins (akismet!)

Imho, writing just an importer should not get you busy for the whole
gsoc, so I would add to the scope one of the following:
* try a BuddyPress integration with the new plugin
* write some compatibility API for older plugins and make sure "Support
Forum" works (since it's being used all over .org, and having new
bbPress will encourage moving away from old bbPress.

Good luck!

@scribu: Thanks very much for the reply. I was actually one of those that
suggested to remove Links Manager from core altogether and if that happens
it's cool. However, even if removed, it would make much more sense to have
that as CPT, as you suggested. Thanks.

@Fris: Yes, that's the idea, but that's a quite basic CPT implementation.
But every bit counts - thanks for that.

You should contact jjj in irc.freenode.net #wordpress-gsoc. As the 
person who's doing the bbPress conversion, he can tell you what is most 
needed and what would be likely to be approved as a project scope.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Problem with admin AJAX not executing plugin code
Message-ID: <BANLkTik49Nt3xzONvsqty-MxGqwboQ3AOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.

I'm having a problem whereby the AJAX managing comments in the admin
area is preventing my plugin code from running.

To complement the 'Easy Comment Uploads' plugin (thanks to Tom Wright)
I'm writing a plugin that will convert an uploaded file (notionally
attached to a comment) to a post attachment when the comment is
approved (and will remove it when the comment is unapproved, trashed,
etc.)

Briefly my plugin should work as follows:
- the ECU plugin uploads files to a wp-content/uploads/comments folder

- when 'approve' clicked:
    - the file is copied to the wp-content/uploads/ folder
    - converted to a post with post_type=attachment, thumbnails
created (using wp_insert_attachment etc.)
    - comment meta created to link comment to new post attachment

- when 'unapproved/spam/trash' clicked:
    - post attachment deleted, thumbnails etc deleted, copy of the
file in /uploads/ is deleted (using wp_delete_attachment)

My code works fine if I disable javascript on the admin
edit-comments.php, but doesn't if javascript is on (the default).

Any help or suggestions much appreciated. Code appended below. Thanks.

Jake

add_action( 'admin_menu', 'jm_comment_attachment_convertor' );

function jm_comment_attachment_convertor() {
	add_action( 'wp_set_comment_status', 'jm_attach_file', 10, 2 );
}

function jm_attach_file( $comment_id, $comment_status ) {
	
	// get comment info (associated page and content of comment)
	$comment = get_comment( $comment_id );
	$postid = $comment->comment_post_ID;
	$content = $comment->comment_content;

	// find upload directory and comment uploads directory
	$upldir = wp_upload_dir();
	$upldir = $upldir[ 'path' ].'/';
	$commupldir = $upldir.'comments/';
		
	// find out if comment upload previously converted to attachment
	$attachment_array = get_comment_meta( $comment_id, "comment_attachment_id" );
	if ($attachment_array)
		$attachment_id = $attachment_array[0];

	// if upload not yet converted, check for uploaded image
	if ( !$attachment_id ) {

		$imgo = strpos( $content, '[img]' );
		$imgc = strpos( $content, '[/img]' );
		if ( $imgo!==false && $imgc && $imgo<$imgc ) {

			// if img url complete and right way round
			$imgurl = substr( $content, $imgo+5, $imgc-5-$imgo );

			// get image filename
			$imgpath = pathinfo( $imgurl );
			$imgpath = $imgpath[ 'basename' ];
			// get path of image
			$imgpath = $commupldir . $imgpath;

			// get path of uploads directory to get path of image
			if ( file_exists( $imgpath )) {
				$img = $imgpath;
				$imgname = basename( $img );
			}
		}
	}

	// APPROVE NEW COMMENT AND CONVERT UPLOAD TO ATTACHMENT

	if ( $img && !$attachment_id && "approve"==$comment_status ) {
		
		// copy file to the main uploads folder
		if ( copy( $img, $upldir . $imgname ))
			$approvedimg = $upldir . $imgname;
		
		// if we have an image and want to approve it
		$wp_filetype = wp_check_filetype( $imgname, null );
		$attachment = array(
		   'post_mime_type' => $wp_filetype[ 'type' ],
		   'post_title' => preg_replace('/\.[^.]+$/', '', $imgname),
		   'post_content' => '',
		   'post_status' => 'inherit'
		);
		$attach_id = wp_insert_attachment( $attachment, $approvedimg, $postid );
		
		// include the image.php file to create thumbnails etc.
		// for the function wp_generate_attachment_metadata() to work
		require_once(ABSPATH . "wp-admin" . '/includes/image.php');
		$attach_data = wp_generate_attachment_metadata( $attach_id, $approvedimg );
		wp_update_attachment_metadata( $attach_id,  $attach_data );
			
		// make a note of the attachment id against the comment so we can
delete the attachment if the comment is unapproved
		add_comment_meta( $comment_id, "comment_attachment_id", $attach_id );
	}
	
	// UNAPPROVE APPROVED COMMENT (DELETE ATTACHMENT BUT NOT ORIGINAL FILE)
	
	else if ( $attachment_id && ( "hold"==$comment_status ||
"spam"==$comment_status || "trash"==$comment_status )) {

		// delete the attachment
		wp_delete_attachment( $attachment_id, $force_delete = false );

		// delete the comment meta linking to this attachment
		delete_comment_meta( $comment_id, "comment_attachment_id" );
	}

	// DELETE NEW/UNAPPROVED/SPAMMED/TRASHED COMMENT AND DELETE ORIGINAL FILE

	else if ( $img && !$attachment_id && "delete"==$comment_status ) {
		// ACTION 'wp_set_comment_status' NOT CALLED WHEN PERMANENT
DELETE??? looks like it in wp-includes/comment.php
		// move the file to the deleted directory
		rename( $img, $deleteddir . $imgname );
	}

Ajax requests do not triger admin_menu, therefore I'm guessing your action
is never hooked. perhaps you should try admin_init instead?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Inconsistency with _wp_attached_file
Message-ID: <BANLkTimWsEL6TMJLbKU2wj=u=zCQ8vBduQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to create a custom upload form for a custom post type. It works
great on the main site, and the values for the _wp_attached_file keys are
all in the year/month/filename format.

I'm using multisite on WordPress 3.1 and when I tried to do the same thing
on a subsite, the values of _wp_attached_file now contain the full URL to
the file.

So when I use wp_get_attachment_url() to retrieve the URL, the URL is wrong
because the domain is repeated twice.

I could filter the output but that seems like a hack. The behavior should be
consistent regardless of whether it's the main site or a subsite.

Where should I start looking to figure out why subsites get the full URL as
the value for the _wp_attached_file key?

Thanks

Subject: [wp-hackers] Thoughts on the Settings API callback
Message-ID: <4D99E159.1080909@philipwalton.com>

I've used the settings API for a couple of plugins in my day, and 
overall I have no complaints. The advantages of it are clear and don't 
need to be listed here. However, I'm currently working on a slightly 
more complex plugin, and I'm running into a real issue that I thought 
I'd just share and ask for feedback on:

The sanitize_callback -- the fourth parameter of the `register_setting` 
function -- is not versatile enough. An actual validation callback is 
needed.

The sanitization callback is really just a filter 
(sanitize_option_%name%) added before an option is saved to the 
database. This is problematic because it's called whenever 
update_option() is called, which (if you didn't realize that, like I 
didn't at first) can lead to issues of recursion. And it means that any 
error checking logic you do -- such as if ( ... ) { 
add_settings_error(); } -- is called unnecessarily every time you save 
that option to the database.

But the more pressing concern of mine is that no validation is actually 
taking place. Even if you do clever workarounds to restore previously 
submitted data, set the input fields back to what they were, and show 
the proper error message(s), you STILL have to save the option to the 
database. You are not able to simply say, "Sorry, until your fill out 
this entire form correctly, I'm not going to save ANY of it!"

Developers should have the option to return false and do nothing on 
error -- like a true validation function should do. The amount of work 
I'm doing to fake validation is probably more work than if I had just 
not used the settings API at all.

Awaiting feedback informing me either how stupid I am or how much you 
agree. Both are welcome.

Dion, thanks for this bit of info! (Sorry, unrelated to this thread) I'm 
writing a plugin that keeps getting screwed up because my AJAX requests 
are calling all the same plugin logic that my main page requests are 
calling.

Do you recommend putting plugin logic that you don't want AJAX requests 
to call in the 'admin_menu' hook, or is there a better place?

It sounds like you might need to re-adjust what hooks you're using for what
processes.

admin_menu should only be used for things like registering admin menu's (as
thats what the hook is for) admin_init should be used for processing things
for all admin requests, load-$pagenow hooks should be used for page-specific
processing, etc..

But you might also want to look into the DOING_AJAX constants which are set
for ajax requests

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=961=Wne6A-Heu01SO2vmpU6nVRw@mail.gmail.com>

Am I wrong in thinking that the only way to modify the output of menus is to
use the above hook? If I wanted to add a class to each menu item, I would
have to use a regular expression to pull each one out? Most everything I see
suggests some variation of the following:

function add_markup_pages($output) {
    $output= preg_replace('/menu-item/', 'first-menu-item menu-item',
$output, 1);
$output=substr_replace($output, "last-menu-item menu-item",
strripos($output, "menu-item"), strlen("menu-item"));
    return $output;
}
add_filter('wp_nav_menu', 'add_markup_pages');

The above code is not quite what I need, of course. But I find it strange
that we can't just apply classes in the Control Panel for menus?

By "Control Panel", do you mean Dashboard -> Appearance -> Menus?

If so, then ensure that you have enabled display of custom classes for menu
items:

1) Click the "Screen Options" tab in the upper right-hand corner
2) Enable the check-box for "CSS Classes"
3) Edit each menu item as needed, by adding custom classes to the "CSS
Classes (optional)" text field

(And if this is too simplistic, or not what you're looking for; my
apologies.)

I'm assuming (and you know what they say about that...) that Thomas is
looking for a way to apply classes automatically, rather than having to
apply them manually to each menu item.

Dion, you're right. I felt uncomfortable using admin_menu for that 
purpose which is why I asked if you had another action recommendation. 
And load-$pagenow is working perfectly, thanks!

Just a question: how would this translate to plugins that already provides multi-language features to WordPress? 
Is this going to be a foundation work for something like a language API as we already have for many things in WP?

I'm asking this because I'm in the midst of a multilanguage plugin rewrite-from-scratch and I'd love to leverage WP APIs as much as possible (also I'd love to avoid the rewrite if it's going to be rewritten again for the next release :-)

Cheers,
Paolo aka pixline

Dear Paolo,

I will consider the support for multi-language plugins, after testing this
plugin http://wpml.org/
This task I scheduled for July 11th ? August 7th and I will define it in
documentation soon.

Best Regrads,
Marko

Sorry to say this, but it looks like you didn't get in details what
exactly GlotPress does.

You should exclude features like:
* ability to translate (for that, GlotPress exists) 
* submit it to GlotPress (the "bridge" should take care of that, not the
end user, other-way people will simply spam GlotPress like in the case
of translate.wordpress.com)
* required authentication on GlotPress (GlotPress public api doesn't
need an account, same for .mo file download)

If I were you, my job/scope would be simple:
Like for updates, add the same notifications and upgrade tools to
core(fork localize)/plugins/themes translation files.

Consider following workflows:
* a new plugin/theme is installed -> ask end-user to download it's
language file if it's not en_US already
* a new plugin/theme update is available -> ask end-user if he wants to
add/update the translation too
* a new plugin/theme was submitted into plugin directory -> add a rating
system (widget) where people can vote to get that plugin included on
GlotPress so people can contribute translations, or send the feedback
directly to the developer to ask for his plugin to get imported (on the
other side, a checkbox when requesting plugin repo can be available that
will say "please add it to GlotPress too")

All the translations should be delivered using GlotPress api and
it's .mo files.

All the work that has to be done for/using available open sourced code
(GlotPress, WordPress core, localize) should be your job, the rest
is .org's team duty.

Talk to @nacin (if he's still in for mentoring this project) during a
gsoc irc meetup, ask him about stuff you/I didn't know.

About timeline:
Delete this stuff - "Setup the revision control system, designing forms
on the option page and projecting classes and UML diagrams." No one
cares about diagrams here, put more time into learning GlotPress
codebase better. SVN will be available asap the new gsoc-ers are
announced, it's not something you will have to care about.

Make sure this - "Synchronization two projects, support for
multi-language plugins, testing and making some enhancements." is done
before midterm, no one's going to wait for 2 months until you will
deliver some working code (though this was already mentioned here).

Good luck and sorry If I sound a bit rude, but you should really take it
more seriously!

Thank you for suggestions!
I will update my proposal according to your suggestions.
I thought about possibility to translate directly from my plugin,
if this translation does not exist on the GP.
What do you think about it?

Best Regards

Subject: [wp-hackers] where's documentation for options pages?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=V6Fm_qC6Kx+J3NJ+ckjnaf1XfGg@mail.gmail.com>

hello

could anyone explain me why for this moment still we don't have
working documentation for creating options pages? :)

in this place:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_Options_Pages

examples and explanations doesn't work. for example in the code is
mentioned function do_settings() which doesnt exists

yes, i see red info about to use old documentation, or go to setting
api http://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_API

i dont want to use old way to create options page. i know that this is
deprecated, so i prefere to move all my plugins to new settings api.
but also this what is described in settings api doesn't work (or maybe
i dont understand something)

this is code which i produced basing on 'creating options page' and
'settings api': http://wklej.org/id/506506/

it doesn't work. it shows field for option 'bet_domyslne_boksiki'
(here's a screenshot http://awesomescreenshot.com/0f4au7zfc )

but after click on save button new value is not saved. still is the
same (which i set directly using update_option() in other part of
code)

can anyone tell what about i forgot? :)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multiple orderby and order options in WP_Query
Message-ID: <BANLkTikhdDCRe0XgqKC7P9W5e3V+16rCjA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have a situation where I want to order a list of post both by author and
date using WP_Query which isn't a problem since 'orderby' lets me do that.
But I want the author part sorted ascending and date part sorted descending.


Any tips on how I can achieve this?

The arguments I pass to WP_Query are:

$author_args = array (
                'post_type'            => 'post',
                'posts_per_page'    => '-1',
                'orderby'            => 'author date',
                'order'                => 'ASC',
                'nopaging'            => true,
                'category_name'        => $category_name
            );

Christian,

My recommendation would be to use one orderby statement in the query, then
filter the array returned to order by your second parameter.

MySQL does support ordering by multiple columns, but not in the sense of
ordering one ASC and the other DESC.  So separate your two paradigms, let
MySQL take care of one for you, then manually do the other via PHP.

MySql support this so there is no need to do it in PHP.

A raw SQL query would do this for you ... "ORDER BY author ASC, date DESC"
but I'm not sure if WP_Query supports that.  That's why I suggested ordering
in PHP over just passing a straight query.

Can anyone confirm whether or not WP_Query can handle multiple column
ordering like this?

I know that's more of a rethorical questions, but in case you didn't know,
the Codex is a community wiki; it's edited by volunteers.

If you managed to get it to work, consider updating the Codex yourself, so
that other people won't waste time on the same issue.

i was always affraid to do that as i do not belive that i am good in
this :) especially now i am learning how to create options pages so i
think it is not good moment to update this page by me. but maybe in
few days i will :)

Hi,

Ive rewritten my proposal based on the feedback of todays chat. I would like
to ask for some more feedback on it, since todays was more general. Also, is
anybody interested in mentoring this project?

There are some parts of the proposal that I will finish tmr. Most of them
are parts that contain information about me and my curriculum, so they do
not need to be discussed.

As far as I know, WP_Query just concatenates the ORDER and ORDER BY 
variables together, so you couldn't naively do what you're asking.

If I were you, I'd write a filter that reorganized the ORDER and ORDER 
BY parts. Then, once the query is run, remove the filter. For example:

$order = column_a, column_b;
$orderby = ASC, DESC;
$my_query = new WP_Query;
$query = array(
     'post_type'=>'post',
     'order' => $order,
     'order_by' => $orderby,
);

add_filter( 'query', 'filter_query' );
$my_query->query( $query );
remove_filter( 'query', 'filter_query' );

function filter_query( $query ) {
     // do query logic
     return $query;
}

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=wocyHpCGvapDjTjiJ1TUT_89=LA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Ive rewritten my proposal based on the feedback of todays chat. I would like
to ask for some more feedback on it, since todays was more general. Also, is
anybody interested in mentoring this project?

There are some parts of the proposal that I will finish tmr. Most of them
are parts that contain information about me and my curriculum, so they do
not need to be discussed.

site:
http://www.thomasvaneyck.com/gsoc2011/2011/04/05/gsoc-proposal-media-library-enhancements/

Thanks!

Thomas

Hi,

Thanks for the replys guys, I was hoping that it could be done with WP_Query
so I wouldn't have to resort to PHP but it looks like that'll have to do. I
wanted to avoid the whole add_filter() way because right now this isn't a
plugin, but I might have to resort to that.

Still open to other suggestions though if I don't manage to get this working
:)

Regards,
//Christian, B?ro 2

Can't do it with a naive WP_Query. Use the posts_orderby filter to add
your own ordering string.

function my_order($orderby) {
global $wpdb;
return "{$wpdb->posts.post_author} ASC, {$wpdb->posts.post_date} DESC";
}

add_filter( 'posts_orderby', 'my_order' );
$blah = new WP_Query(...);
remove_filter( 'posts_orderby', 'my_order' );

Yeah, except remove_filter() will remove all callbacks attached to
posts_orderby, due to this bug:

Hi
I am wondering if there is a security update that is equivalent to the WP 3.1.1 for WP 3.0.5

I know that its best to update to the latest version but we are still in the middle of a school year and 
people don't like change especially in the exam session, it stressed them out. 

Any help would be appreciated. Does the security update effect 3.0.5 users?

Two of the three are applicable to the 3.0 branch. The fixes are reflected
in SVN:
http://core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/3.0

You can also download the latest build of the branch here:

Bug doesn't apply. The remove_filter() function, in this case, works
and does what you would expect it to do. It doesn't remove all
callbacks.

This code works perfectly, for example:

function run_once() {
       return 'test';
}
add_filter( 'foobar', 'run_once' );

function another_filter() {
       return 'test again';
}
add_filter( 'foobar', 'another_filter', 11 );

remove_filter( 'foobar', 'run_once' );

echo apply_filters( 'foobar', '' ); // produces "test again"

What happens when you call 'remove_filter' from inside the run_once  
function and call the filter twice?

Hi Everyone!

Not sure if this is the perfect place for this, but I wasn't sure of a
better one, so here it is.


I've been working for years in web development, and recently started
work as a developer at DreamHost, to contribute to the WordPress
community.


I just wanted to be sure I said "Howdy!", as I'm looking forward to
working with all of you.


I've been working with WordPress for projects and support for about
two years now, but am just now beginning as far as core development
goes.

As such, I'll certainly ask some stupid questions along the way, but
I'm here to contribute, and help make WordPress better software for
everyone.



You'll definitely see me around!

If you have any questions for me, just let me know, and I'll be happy to answer.


-Mike

Welcome! If you have any questions about community stuff, feel free to 
ask. The very best way to get started as a contributor is to jump into 
Trac and review previous tickets to get a feel for how we tend to look 
at things, then try a few patches on your own. Helping out in the 
support forums is also a great way to keep your hand in and understand 
the things that are driving people crazy. :)

Hi,

I want to contribute to WordPress during GSoC 2011 if I can manage to get
selected. I have a few questions:

*1) *As we should to contribute to WP in some way before the proposal, I'm
writing a plugin for WP right now. Does it matter how complex the plugin I'm
writing is?
*2) *Should I send my proposal drafts to this mail list, or directly to the
GSoC site?
*3) *Should I use the template given by the WP team for the draft?

Thanks in advance,

Mert Yazicioglu

1) If it's trivial, it doesn't count. :)

2) Should post it on your blog and then leave a link here.

3) Yes.

Message-ID: <BANLkTikv+GqX7FAU2VoE_j3Fbs+SzuFpiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

For a little while Wordpress appeared to be maintaining an official mirror
on github, but it's been dark for months:
https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress

I'm aware that there's this one, which seems up to date, but I'd prefer to
get my wordpress from an official source:
https://github.com/dxw/wordpress

I'm aware that this list/Automattic has decided against moving WP to git,
but could WP at least maintain the mirror? It would make maintaining
wordpress much simpler for me and I suspect a lot of others. It doesn't seem
like it would take much work, and would provide an easy way for many people
to move wordpress into their existing github workflows.

Any interest?

Thanks,
Andrew

Andrew, just wanted to let you and this list know that I am
*definitely*interested in an official GitHub mirror.  It would make my
WordPress
deployment much easier.

Hi Jane,

Thanks for your reply, and the welcome! =D

I've definitely been working through trac a bit already, and working
on collecting all of the various methods of keeping up with WordPress
progress (including the forums, of course).


Appreciate your suggestions, and will certainly be working on patches
soon -- I'm currently looking out for some good ones to start out on.


Thanks!
-Mike

Yes, it counts, but a few core patches would count even more. ;-)

Also, make sure you're subscribed to http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/

Discussion & notes about core tend to end up there. Also, if you can,
try and get to the weekly IRC chat, which is on Wednesday at 16:00 UTC.
(If only that time were more convenient for Australians...)

Hi list,

I'll post a few more applications the following days, I'd be glad if

A quick review of it:
 * The next default theme, 2011, is said to include more HTML5, no public
development is underway that I'm aware of, It'll debut with 3.2 hopefully
 * It's Summer of Code, Not documentation, so writing guidelines is kinda
out.
 * A tool to convert themes to HTML5 seems a bit useless IMO, Themes
generally include pretty complex styling on header/sidebar elements and
you'll find it incredibly hard to work reliably with those. HTML5 also
doesnt "give" anything to most themes, they're nice elements to take
advantage of.. but you write a theme with HTML5 in mind, or with XHTML in
mind.. it's a waste of time to convert to another one simply for the point
of changing to it.

IMO, I wouldn't put too much effort into that propsal as it's unlikely to be
chosen based on the above..

Geez, I forgot that documentation can't be done in SoC. By the way I
was having the same thoughts after I finished, but I gave it a try :)
Thanks for the review.

Hi!

Would this work if I put the function in functions.php and then the rest in
a template file?

Thanks again for all the help guys!

So I had wordpress multisite problem with a site database.  I restored
everything and am now back up and running.

My problem now is that the import from the WordPress xml grabbed the post
images and they are all correctly linking however it didn't grab the
featured images.  At this point I just want to go back in and reset all the
featured images manually, not a big deal.

However the Media Gallery shows 0 images.  They are in the blogs.dir folder
in the correct places but just not showing up in the Media Gallery section
of the site.

I know this is probably something for the tech support forum but my question
may actually make sense and belong on the hackers email.

QUESTION:  How do I force the media gallery to look through all the images
on the server and re-index them?

Look at the plugin, "Add from Server". I'm not sure if it works with 3.1 but
its worth checking out. It does work on 3.0.
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-from-server/
Essentially, it copies stray image files into the WP upload system and
registers them so they are able to be managed by the Media Manager.

I'm not sure there is a way to get the media manager itself to scan through
the server and import image data. It would be a darned good enhancement for
a future release.

Cheers,
Lynne

Hi,

Could someone please have a look at the scope, and tell me what they think.
I'm doubting a little bit. Is it perhaps just too much? Or does this seem
realistic?
I sometimes have the feeling that the filters is just a little bit too big
to include. Problem is without it, I have the feeling it becomes too small
:-)

Also, if anybody would be interested in mentoring me, please let me know!

Hey Ryan!

Definitely subscribed there.

As far as the weekly chats go, I sadly wasn't able to make it today,
but I plan to be there regularly!


Thanks for the heads up.

1) Please don't spam the mailing list.  Sending out the same proposal
twice in an hour counts as spam in my book.

2) you should be feature complete by July 11th (the start of the mid
term evaluation), not the end

3) Can you provide some links for your listed WordPress experience

4) I would strongly encourage you to contribute some patches to trac
before formally submitting your proposal.

2) Fixed it.

3) Added them.

4) Okay, I'll see what I can do.

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=f4NWxP9=3VqEM+gvUj1uHvDmoFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I just stumble upon the GSoC2011 page in the codex talking about
bbPress: http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2011#bbPress_.280.29 . There
you can find mention of importers for other forums.

I'm not a student looking for a mentorship but I would like to tell
you about my e107 Importer plugin. This plugin I'm currently
developing can import all kind of content from an e107 instance,
including forums. I think my code can then help anyone bootstrap any
importer development for bbPress.

My plugin is available in the official WordPress plugin directory (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/e107-importer/ ), but main
development happen in a GitHub repository (
http://github.com/kdeldycke/e107-importer ).

Hope this help ! :)

Message-ID: <1302193391.8148.9.camel@kovalsky-netbook>

Hello everybody,

I'm new on this list because I want to propose you my idea for GSoc,
based on your idea of Super-Accessible Admin. 
As I'm very interested in the fact to give the possibility to disabled
people to publish on Internet, I think this idea is very great. 

I've known in php/sql (not on wordpress), a lot in html/css and few in
accessibility. 

My idea is to improve for disabled people the way to administrate a
wordpress and to publish more easyly content on their blog/website. For
this I want to increase contrast in color, improve navigation without
mouse (which passed by erase javascript) and to permit the people who
needed it to use zoomer tool on the text.

I know that this idea come a little late but I hope that you can answer
me quickly to make a real proposal.

Hope to read you quickly and sorry for my bad English I'm french. 

Kovalsky

If anyone is interested. I've put together some documentation on the PHP 
- Zen Coding project I wrote about a few weeks ago. Here is the URI: 
http://philipwalton.com/2011/04/06/zen-coding-for-php-and-wordpress/

I've optomized it for WordPress to take advantage of functions like 
esc_attr() and esc_url() so developers don't have to worry about that stuff.

Here's a quick example:

echo $zc->expand(
   '.posts>ul>li.post$*6',
   array("Red","Orange","Yellow","Green","Blue","Violet")
);

outputs:

<div class="posts">
   <ul>
     <li class="post1">Red</li>
     <li class="post2">Orange</li>
     <li class="post3">Yellow</li>
     <li class="post4">Green</li>
     <li class="post5">Blue</li>
     <li class="post6">Violet</li>
   </ul>
</div>

What you need to do is write up a very specific proposal outlining how 
you would approach each issue (code approach), put together a timeline, 
and describe exactly what you would be doing over the summer term. The 
paragraph you gave above is too close to the description on our Ideas 
page for it to generate any feedback.

the proposal and make up the progress later..is it ok
thanks again

Subject: [wp-hackers] Getting every page ID, URL, and Title on site
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=QdzyTOadHrg_aqNeEKrkjSHQ7Fw@mail.gmail.com>

Any ideas on the cleanest way to list every page (inc pages, posts, and
custom post types) in a site?

I only require ID, Title and Permalink(URL) for each page.

Seems so simple, but running a loop seems so excessive as I don't require
the page content at all ... and get_pages only works on pages (not custom
post types) (plus also returns content).

Any suggestions for the least intensive way to simply get these three items?

Thanks,
Rob

Message-ID: <5B3B36E9-519D-4406-A1BF-BF6ADEA94154@gmail.com>

Hi 

I am wondering how the plugin page or a particular plugin gets updated. 
As I understand this the content gets rendered from the readme.txt file. 
And when you update the readme file you plugin page should get updated as well. 

I made the updates to the readme file of a plugin I am maintaining but the changes are not reflected on 
wordpress.org 

here is the readme file on svn 
http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/people-lists/trunk/readme.txt

here is what the plugin page looks like 
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/people-lists/changelog/


Thanks for any help in clarifying this. 

Cheers Enej

If you put together a proposal and send that, as was specified in our 
listing, then you could get feedback. Just asking if you can apply is 
not likely to get a response, since the Timeline established by Google 
for applications already makes it clear that applications will be 
accepted until April 18 at 19:00 UTC. If you want to propose a specific 
project, and write up your outline of how it would go with a schedule, 
deliverables, and code approach, you would probably get feedback then.

This problem has been reported a number of times recently which
suggests that something has definitely changed and needs fixing.

Try adding some whitespace to the end of the readme.txt in trunk to
force an update. See the ticket below for further instructions.

#16522 is the Trac ticket that is currently open:

Robert, I have a plugin that does a similar thing to what you're asking:
PW_Archives <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pw-archives/> (to toot my
own horn). You can probably look at the source, specifically the queries I'm
doing, and customize them for your purposes.

I had the same problem you're having because in order to get the permalink
of a post via a WordPress function, you have to download its content from
the database as well, which seems like an incredible waste to me since some
of my sites have 1000+ posts with tons of content.

My solution was kind of hackish, but basically I'm doing a custom query for
all the posts and creating a fake post object (excluding content and other
unnecessary stuff), so get_permalink doesn't run an additional query. The
only problem with this is if the user has some crazy permalink structure
that requires this extra post info, it'll break.

I did some testing on my site and it reduced page load from like 3 seconds
to less than a second.

Hope that helps.

Is it not just a matter, off the top of my head.
Of doing a standard query to get all the ID's of post type published
Or just doing a query to get the relevant columns from the database (where the post is published)

Depending on what the end content is for

Oups... my actual reply:


I see you intend to use svn for versioning. The problem with that is most
people don't have svn installed on their server, being on shared hosting,
which severely limits it's appeal.

Also, by tieing it to svn, you also discourage users that prefer other SCMs,
like git or mercurial.

I agree, and also from a UX perspective I don't think that SCM-specific
ideas should carry over into theme file version control.  For example, a
non-technical user of WordPress is not likely to know what a commit is, what
revision numbers mean, or even what a revision is.  They will be more
interested in a solution that gives them an "undo" function for changes that
they might make to their theme files.

It is true that users who are editing their theme files are more advanced
than ones who know nothing about HTML/CSS, however even if the solution was
not specific to one SCM (git, SVN, etc), IMHO the version control system
should work like the existing post version control system and not require
users to have preknowledge about SCMs or even require them to learn about
them.

Just my thoughts, though.

Copy the following code into the root of your WordPress website as something like 'tsv-export.php' and then load the file in your browser and you'll get a tab-separated list of what you need.

<?php
include('wp-load.php');
header('Content-type: text/tab-separated-values');
$query = new WP_Query(array(
	'post_type' => 'any',
	'post_status' => 'publish',
	'post_per_page' => -1,
));
foreach($query->posts as $post) {
	$title = get_the_title($post->ID);
	$permalink = get_permalink($post->ID);
	echo "{$post->ID}\t\"{$post->post_type}\"\t\"{$title}\"\t\"{$permalink}\"\n";
}

Even though it does filter out 'nav_menu_item' and similar posts, WP_Query does load everything including content, something you may not want.  If you don't want to load everything per record, here's another approach (you can add addition WHERE clause criteria to exclude items you want to exclude):

<?php
include('wp-load.php');
header('Content-type: text/tab-separated-values');
global $wpdb;
$posts = $wpdb->get_results("SELECT ID,post_type FROM {$wpdb->posts} WHERE post_status='publish'");
foreach($posts as $post) {
	$title = get_the_title($post->ID);
	$permalink = get_permalink($post->ID);
	echo "{$post->ID}\t\"{$post->post_type}\"\t\"{$title}\"\t\"{$permalink}\"\n";
}

Hope this helps.

-Mike

Mike, your second approach still loads the content. It's the exact same 
problem I had when writing my PW_Archives plugin. The function 
get_permalink() accepts an object or an integer. If it's passed an 
integer, WordPress runs a query for that post so it can create an object 
(downloading the content from the database mind you), and then uses that 
post object to figure out the permalink.

If you run an SQL log of your second method, you'll notice at least one 
query per post, which is incredibly wasteful, but unfortunately what 
most archiving/sitemap plugins do.

Message-ID: <4D9E99C3.7030903@yahoo.com>

I'm having a bit of trouble displaying comments in a custom design and 
wonder if it's related to comments_popup_link.

When I select the comments link in the metadata bar below the headline, 
the content (and any comments) disappear and the comments form jumps to 
the top of the page.

I've messed something up here for sure, but I've been following the 
tutorial at spoonagraphics 
(http://www.blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-build-a-custom-wordpress-theme-from-scratch) 
and believe I've included all the necessary bits and pieces.

Test site is here:

I'd appreciate any assistance!

Thanks.

By "content", do you mean post_content and post_excerpt?  If yes, you are correct; WordPress doesn't allow a hook to (easily) omit loading post_content and post_excerpt.

That said, WordPress uses a permalink structure that, to be generic must be able to see each and every  field in a post. Yes, for a specific site you can optimize but in general you cannot bypass the hook that handles permalink structure if you want the permalinks to be 100% correct, and in those hooks the permalink may choose to inspect the post object.  By omitting post_content or post_excerpt we could trigger an incorrect email but my guess is that would be unlikely so if it were me I'd be willing to risk it.

That's just one of the things that one must deal with in exchange for WordPress' flexibility with permalinks.

At the bottom of this email is another version that omits the post_content and post_excerpt.

> If you run an SQL log of your second method, you'll notice at least one query per post, which is incredibly wasteful, but unfortunately what most archiving/sitemap plugins do.

It's only wasteful if it takes too long, runs out of memory or costs a significant amount extra for computing power.  Otherwise, it's like when a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it; does the noise of falling really matter?

If you really need to have only one query you could pre-populate the 'posts' cache with objects that don't have post_content or post_excerpt but then you run into the problem of running another large query where you may run out of memory if you have too many posts. But when you are talking scale, things are rarely easy.

i have looked into this...

it is related to your css i think:

.equalheight>  div {		
	padding-bottom: 32767px;
	margin-bottom: -32767px;
}

when i disable this. it works as expected :)

Kind regards,

plugin url is a url to a site that is about your plugin.
not to the plugin itself....

Register your plugin via the website right there, The URL needs to be a url
on your domain explaining what the plugin is.
Once approved, You'll have a svn repository created for you, and you'll be
emailed the details.
Once you have the repository, you can use TortoiseSVN for windows (or any
SVN client) to upload the files into
http://svn.wp-plugins.org/your-plugin-name
Once you've uploaded your files, you'll need to add a readme.txt file,
here's a sample file:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/readme.txtdownload it,
change ALL the text to suit your plugin.
Now wait for people to download your plugin and report about the bugs it
contains (which arn't bugs, just the fact it doesnt work the way they want
it to :))

Message-ID: <SNT105-W229CB66EBBC0B0BA449893BAA70@phx.gbl>


Hello!
 
I thought I'd introduce myself. My name's Wai Hong and I am currently an undergraduate (Computer Engineering) at National University of Singapore. I'm an avid blogger! (Or so I hope.)
 
Apologies for the mail. I know that it's probably unearthly hour for most of the mentors right now. Would someone please kindly take a look at my proposal for Google Summer of Code 2011 for Wordpress and give some feedback/comments so that I can improve on it? It would be much appreciated. =) It's here:- http://blog.lithegrace.com/2011/04/wordpress-proposal-for-google-summer-of-code-2011/ Thanks in advance!
 
I also understand it might be a little late right now but the application period really came at an unopportune time for me because of project deadlines and my exams are actually in 2 week's time. Looking on the bright side, there's still a few more hours to go. Let's make full use of what we have!
 
Looking forward to working with Wordpress over this summer.
 
Thank you very much for your kind attention,
-Wai Hong

Subject: [wp-hackers] Selecting only publicly queryable posts
Message-ID: <BANLkTikh+Xm3Y6oK1XJGLh67o2tokSfsBA@mail.gmail.com>

Can you select ONLY publicly_queryable posts from a database? (Thanks
everyone for your help on a related topic yesterday).

E.g, some custom post types are non publicly_queryable.

I need to select all posts in the database that are of a post_type that are
publicly_queryable.

I can run that, if I can figure how you generate a list of the publicly
queryable post types? Any ideas?

Thanks as ever!

$args = array('publicly_queryable' => true); 	
$post_types = get_post_types($args);

Use _builtin = false if you don't want the WP builtin post types
(pages/posts/attachments).

You could store their history as an array in a cookie? Set it to expire
after x hours and then just read that cookie if they send a contact message?
Zero performance hit on your server.

Many thanks, Peter. I've removed the equalheight class from my single.php.

Any thoughts on why the problem occurs?

I am wondering - how is it possible to add custom post types to the new
links helper? One can easily link to pages, or posts, but how about custom
posts?

Thanks a lot.

Alex, this functionality is working on my site with custom post types, 
and I didn't do anything special to set it up. I believe it should just 
work as long as you've registered your custom post type properly.

(And just to make sure I'm clear on what you're asking: you're referring 
to creating links within the TinyMCE editor, correct? And you want it to 
show custom post types in the list of available links, no?)

Message-ID: <72228438-6797-44AD-98B0-54580805C71C@pumastudios.com>

Hi all - been lurking for a while, first time asking a question here.

I'm trying to cleanup a bunch of stuff that gets put into the database related to a plugin I'm writing but am stymied by the flow in delete_plugins().  I've got my uninstall.php file setup and have found that unless I provide FTP login information during the Delete operation I can't get to the point that the uninstall script will run.

Should I open a bug in the tracker to have the delete_plugins() flow improved to allow the uninstall process to run separate from the file deletion?  I really want to clean the database and don't want (or need) WP to go do the actual file deletion.

And any thoughts on how to get my uninstall to run given the current state of the logic?

I don't want to do the cleanup when the plugin is deactivated since there are many reasons to deactivate on a temporary basis.

-- Ken

Ken,

In the past, I've seen developers place an "Uninstall" link on the plugins
page for their plugin.  Then they bind any uninstall scripts to this link
and also deactivate the plugin at the same time.

Is that the kind of setup you're looking for?  I'm not sure what else you're
trying to accomplish or how you're trying to do it.

Eric,

That's a good option.  I was trying to leverage the support already in place in WP as documented here:
https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_uninstall_hook

Feels like re-inventing the wheel to have to put an 'uninstall' option into the plugin options page.  Core will almost do what is needed and other authors that do use the documented method fall into the same trap.  If the admin doesn't want to, or can't, supply FTP login information it's not possible to get to the uninstall handling built into the plugin.  This seems like a design flaw.

ps.  Just so happens I posted an answer to a question of yours on stackexchange re: WP Rewrite right before reading your response below.  :)

No, it's not a design flaw. Uninstall means just that: uninstall. If
you don't give it the FTP login information, then it can't delete the
plugin files.

If it actually did run the uninstall code before getting the necessary
information to finish the uninstall and then delete the files, then
that most certainly *would* be a design flaw.

Transients are stored in the database by default, so if you're doing
something like saving a transient on every page load then that equals
a database write for every visitor on every page.

You could install Xcache on your server and then install an Xcache
plugin for WordPress. WordPress will then automatically store
transient data in Xcache rather than the database. Same goes for
Memcache, I'm sure there are plugins for that too.

How about adding to an array in a cookie on each pageload, saves on
processing on the serverside each time. Then just save the cookie when
the feedback form is submitted.

What I do is at the bottom of my options page for my plugins I have a
check box, labeled 'Uninstall on Deactivation'.  When the user clicks
that and saves the options that sets an uninstall flag in my plugin
options.  When the user deactivates the plugin I have a deactivation
hook that runs, that will check for that uninstall flag and if set
will then proceed to delete all the options and stuff associated with
my plugin.  I don't personally include any code to delete my plugin
files, thats simple enough for them to do from the plugin manager.

I really don't understand that approach at all. You're adding an unnecessary
and inconsistent UI option rather than leveraging the consistent uninstall
process that WordPress provides plugin authors.

I personally support this approach, actually ? I think it's a bad idea to delete tables, destroy options, etc. on deactivate. What if you're just momentarily deactivating to test something ? if you delete everything on deactivation you will lose everything. Instead, having a sort of "hard uninstall" that destroys all your data makes sense to me.

There's a difference between the Deactivation hook and the Uninstall hook.
The uninstall hook runs when you use the "Delete Plugin" functionality, The
deactivation hook runs when you, well, deactivate the plugin.

The good thing about the Uninstall hook, is that your plugin does not need
to be activated in order to use it, whereas, the deactivation hook (and
therefor, the option pages wit ha uninstall checkbox..) need to be activated
before it can be used.

Now, Back to Ken's problem..
Ken, What is the flow you're trying to get working exactly? Do you want some
kind of UI steps in the uninstall process?
The uninstall hook/file is designed that you simply run the code to clean up
after yourself, no questions asked.  You'd use this style to remove any
cached data in the database, and non-default options. Some people might have
a want to keep the user settings in the install (in which case, you'd set to
them to autoload=no) - but most people will remove all data, including user
settings (which is recommended as a thorough cleanup)

It should also be pointed out that when you upgrade versions of WordPress
it's recommended that you deactivate and then reactive all plugins.

Deleting user settings form the database on deactivation could really screw
up a lot of people's sites when they're upgrading.

The automatic WordPress upgrader may actually deactivate and reactive as
well, though someone else would have to confirm that.

But I am using wufoo forms to get contact information.

Let me break it for you



   1.

   I store history data on each navigation click in database using
   set_transient.
   2.

   I generated contact form using Wufoo. In Wufoo form i created extra
   hidden field and while inseriting the script of wufoo form I have assigned
   shortcode to that hidden field which generat unique id for each visitor.
   3.

   Using that unique id i store transient data.
   4.

   Once the form is generated i can not access the form elements using
   javascript or jQuery.
   5.

   So when somebody submits the contact form by using wufoo's feature of
   webhook I again sent post data to my site.
   6.

   At init hook i get the data sent from webhook by using unique id again i
   get history data using get_transient and insert it in another permanent
   table.

So i have to use wufoo form. Please help me.

Dion,

I am trying to use the uninstall hook.  However, unless you provide valid FTP/sFTP login credentials you can't get to the point of executing the hook.  In my situation, FTP/sFTP are not enabled on the server so there's no way to respond in a way that will allow the uninstall hook to execute.

What I need is a method to execute the uninstall hook WITHOUT the requirement to provide the FTP/sFTP credentials.  As I mentioned before, I consider this to be a design flaw as I'm unable to trigger the plugin uninstall code.

It's not a requirement that plugins be installed using the Admin screen, why should it be a requirement that they be deleted (i.e. remove the files) through it?

I think that's a valid argument. We have to accept and cater to the fact
that not all setups permit uninstallation via the admin, just like not all
setups allow automatic upgrades.

One idea is that you could create your own uninstall procedure that's manually run from a plugin settings page that simply runs delete_option.  If you have to manually delete the plugin anyways, this shouldn't be too much of a stretch.

If you can't actually uninstall the plugin, then it would make perfect
sense to me that you can't run the uninstall hook either.

If you don't have FTP available, then consider configuring your server
such that the "direct" method works properly. This is a setuid setup,
basically, and there's a half a dozen ways to do it. The easiest would
be to use suPHP instead of the normal PHP setup.

Strongly agree.

I could entertain the idea for an API abstraction that can fire an uninstall
hook. But I wouldn't then want it to just get abused.

I was wondering if there is a better way to add a message to the admin panel
like a functionother than the admin notices hook, which requires a function
for each message.

The point of Wordpress is you add a function to a hook.... (quite a pain sometimes)

In theory you could add messages to an array.
Then call admin_notices and your function iterates thru the array and echos them all.....

Give me some credit, I understand the concept of a hook.

What I am saying is simply in the case of the admin_notices hook I'd imagine
most the time each function hooked in to it is 99% the same, just different
text.  What I have done about this is to create a function I include with
all my plugins that simple takes a parameter for the text and handles the
rest.  No I'm not saying the admin_notices hook should go away in favor for
a function.  Hooks are really useful for executing arbitrary code at
specific points, and I've seen plugins that use it to display notices with
customize designs (like a blue box instead of yellow or red).  I simple
think a function to cover the more common usage would be simpler and more
straight forward though than always using the hook directly.

1) I want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel here so to speak if the
core already has such a function
2) If core does not have such a function, would this be something that could
be added, i mean if if open a trac ticket and include a patch file to add my
function I already use in my plugins to core would it actually be likely to
be included in core or would I just be wasting my time to go thought he
process of a svn checkout and building a patch file.

I don't think such a function, by itself, would make it in. However, a more
general messaging API to be used throughout the admin might.

There was a ticket about this on trac, but I can't find it now.

Setting up a server to prevent modification of the code is a good security practice and helps protect a site from hacking.

Is the following sequence to remove a plugin supported?

- Disable plugin in the admin menu
- Via shell, or other method outside the WP admin screens, remove the plugin files from the file system.

Abused in what way?  I don't understand the concern.  

What I envision as a viable solution is in the 'Delete' process to add an option to only execute the plugin uninstall action and leave the file system untouched.  The action could finish with a notice to the user that to complete the removal of the plugin the related files should be removed.

Actually, the uninstall procedure is run even if the file deletion fails.

This does not happen, however, if you're prompted for the FTP credentials
and you don't provide them, as it's considered you aborted the procedure.

So, to do achieve the effect you want, just add this line in your
wp-config.php file:

define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');

This will prevent the FTP credentials from appearing.

The logic appears to require a valid login to continue past the FTP credential screen.  What would be ideal are three possible paths when prompted for the FTP credentials.

1) Supply valid credentials - process continues
2) Abort Operation
3) Run the plugin uninstall method

Thanks for the suggestion for this define.

This does work in my specific case, in general an intuitive method to get through this process would be a great addition in terms of ease of use.

Well, with a little thought, I'm sure you could make a meta-plugin that adds
an interface to explicitly trigger the uninstall procedure. It's either
calling a stored callback or include()ing the uninstall.php file.

I don't think your scenario is common enough to warrant including this in
Core. It increases the ease of use in your case, but for all the rest of the
WP users, it adds an unnecessary UI element.

I would probably save the IDs of the users who are allowed access as postmeta, and then before displaying the article check get_currentuser_data. If the ID isn't in the array then die gracefully. You could probably use a filter to ensure those articles don't show in archive pages, too.

Alternatively, if there's just a group of users that will always see those articles, create a new user level and give them permission to read private articles, then use WP's built-in functionality for that.

Looking at it again, there's an "Are you sure" screen displayed before the
FTP details are requested.

After the user clicks "Confirm", the uninstall procedure should fire either
way.

Will open a ticket on this.

On the third thought, the only reason this inconsistency creeps up is
because I force the file deletion to fail.

I'll stick to my previous comment: plugin territory.

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/ has, alongside great
role-editing functionality, a shortcode to restrict content to users
of a specific role. If you literally need to display content to
individual users, not just roles, I'm sure the shortcode from the
plugin could be copied & easily modified to do this.

You can hook into admin_notices.
http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices (no
docs there yet)

Example:
add_action('admin_notices', 'function_name');

You can use the core WP styling with this HTML setup:
<div id="message">
         <p>Aenean eros ante, porta commodo lacinia.</p>
</div>

Just curious is it safe to begin testing plugins for compatibility with a
new version during the beta, or would I be better off waiting for the
release candidate?

Beta1, And report any incompatibilities you find that seems like a core bug.
Beta 2 to make sure those bugs were fixed appropriately
Beta 3 to make sute things still work
RC - If it doesnt work now, you better tell us ASAP and it better be a big
bug, otherwise you'll have to wait until .1 before the bug gets fixed..

Release Candidates are just that, Release candidates, the bug fixing and
testing has been done, it's the final round to make sure there are no huge
major regressions which is going to cause problems for a lot of people.
Quite often tiny bugs will be reported at the last second, and by that time,
they have to wait for the next maintenance release..

I personally use http://blogtrottr.com/ and have it email me new entries on
this feed http://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/feed

That way its simple, I get an email when a new news post is made in the
releases category, makes it simple since I live in my email not so much on
the wordpress site.

If you *really* don't like the concept of hooking a function in, you
could always target PHP 5.3+ and use anonymous functions:


    add_action('admin_notices', function () {
        echo 'your message';
    });


Not something I'd use personally, but the option is available.

No need to target 5.3+; you can do anonymous functions in PHP 4.0+:

add_action('admin_notices', create_function('', 'echo "your message";'));

I would strongly recommend you avoid create_function() at all costs. It
poses a pretty serious security risk when used improperly. It's a priority
for us to remove all of them from the core codebase. (We're close.)

I would also recommend (in general) you avoid closures. I use them in
testing all the time -- add_action( 'init', function() { ... } ); -- but in
a public plugin, it's not playing very nice with others, as the callback
can't easily be removed.

That is useful for turning 4 lines of code into one, but still a paint to
type for each message.  I make it easier with this function in each of my
plugins:

if (!function_exists('_adminmsg')) {
 // A function to hook into admin_notices and either display an updated or
error message.
  function _adminmsg($msg, $type = 'msg') {
  if (!isset($msg)) {
   // No message was set, no point in displaying an empty notice box
   return false;
  }

  if (($type === 'msg') || ($type === 'message')) {
   add_action('admin_notices', create_function('', 'echo \'<div id="message"
class="updated"><p>' . $msg . '</p></div>\';'));
   return true;
  }

  if (($type === 'err') || ($type === 'error')) {
   add_action('admin_notices', create_function('', 'echo \'<div id="message"
class="error"><p>' . $msg . '</p></div>\';'));
   return true;
  }

  // Not a valid type
  return false;
 }
}

Then I just call _adminmsg('my message here');

The purpose was to reallly make sure I wasn't reinventing someting core
already does, but apparantly not, though I think its useful and should be
part of the plugin API per scribu's comment it dosen't seem like such a
function would make it into core.

Oops I did not know that, see my last post, that's actually what I use.
Which means I'll have to redo how I do admin notices, back to the drawing
board as to how to do this simply without 4 lines of code and a new function
with lots of redundant code, which idk if that will be possible short of
some core implementation.

I could always do like Barry said, and just add the message to a globalized
array and hook in once with a single function to itterate though the array
and echo out.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Plugin Fatal error refers to WP core
Message-ID: <BANLkTinRFZVe-krrpBoqEbwgQb8BC_3WCA@mail.gmail.com>

Ok this is wierd.  I am having problems activating my plugin I wrote on my
test WP install.  WP_DEBUG is set to true, php error reporting is set to
E_ALL.  I activate my plugin and it says it triggered a fatal error, then
PHP gives this error:

*Deprecated*: Function set_magic_quotes_runtime() is deprecated in *
C:\xampp\htdocs\WordPress\wp-settings.php* on line *27*

So I'm lost, not only is this in a core file not my plugin, but idk if a
deprecated notice constitutes a "fatal error" my guess is not.  According to
my PHP IDE there are no syntax errors or anything in my plugins code so idk
what is going on, any ideas?

That's not a fatal error, it's just E_DEPRECATED, which even with WP_DEBUG
on, should be suppressed. If your plugin is breaking, it shouldn't be due to
this.

If you set error_reporting and error_log outside of PHP (in php.ini), you
should be able to trap whatever you haven't caught yet.

Sure, but are you logging them to a file, and properly inspecting them?

When a plugin fatal errors on activation, it does so immediately before the
page redirects. Then it attempts to re-load the plugin into an iframe (so
you can see the error), but that's not foolproof. The point is, use an error
log to catch those.

Also, for WordPress on PHP 5.3+, use E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT.

Indeed, ditto for anything using exec()  (though, that doesn't stop
people using exec plugins. :) )

I disagree. Assign it to a (public) variable, and then anyone can remove it:

    class MyAwesomePlugin {
        public static $callbacks = array();
        public function add_message($msg) {
            $func = function () use ($msg) { echo $msg; }
            self::$callbacks[] = $func;
            add_action('admin_notices', $func);
        }
    }

Then another plugin can simply do:

    if (class_exists('MyAwesomePlugin')) {
        foreach (MyAwesomePlugin::$callbacks as $callback) {
            remove_action('admin_notices', $callback);
        }
    }


Note: It's important that the callbacks property be static, unless you
want people checking global variables, and then it gets messy.

Mind you, this comes to the same problem, where you need a helper
function. Personally, I'd go for just adding the callback and not
worrying about if another plugin wants to remove the notice. If they
really want it, I can add it in version x+1. :)

Use the WordPress Beta Tester plugin (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) on your
development installation and just keep it updated to the latest nightly.  It
will be pretty obvious when we hit Beta releases and RCs because they're
noted in the footer and on the dashboard.

Or check the WP-Testers mailing list.

Or check http://wpdevel.wordpress.com as scribu suggests.

Or drop in to the IRC dev chat on Wednesdays.

Or follow @nacin on Twitter so he can harass you to test new releases when
they come out.

Are you implying then, that, used properly, it poses no security risk?

I think the create_function() scare is really a tainted data problem.
Don't use create_function() in circumstances where the input is not from
a trusted source.

Of course, one could argue that a programmer is not a trusted source. :)

This is probably the ticket you were thinking of, it has discussion on
relevant topics:

Move show_message() into WP_Error class and add support for various WP_Error
features that are missing <http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12254>
It doesn't directly solve the admin_notices issue, but support for that use
case is obvious once the show_message() situation is worked out. A WP_Error
based messaging system could be used by plugins in admin_notices to avoid
display inconsistency even if they weren't using a more global error
registration API.

I imagine transients would be the best way to implement a system for adding
a message at any time and having it shown on the next pageload in
admin_notices, though you would probably want to also use _POST to make sure
it's the same user who caused the message to be shown.

It wasn't that one, but a ticket that mentioned transients as you say.

Anyway, found an even simpler proposal:

Subject: [wp-hackers] Multisite Remote Database
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=WmUniTk6gNnRO_9GiJTr+G0MgYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone.

I am trying to set up a test environment for a multisite install and figured
that the most realistic tests would be when done with actual data from from
the target site. So... I had an exsisting multisite install over at
hostgator and i edited wp-config.php to read -

// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', '*****');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', '*****'');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', '*****'');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', '***.***.***.**:3306');

/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');

I then added the ip of the hostgator account to the access list on the
server i want the data pulled from (a VPS at wiredtree).

I struggled for a while to get it to even connect before realising port 3306
needed to be open....

However once that was fixed i then just got an infinite loop whenever i
tried to access the test site (which is connecting to the live database).

I must be doing something wrong...

I am struggling to see how it would work anyway TBH...

Would somebody mind explaining and/or pointing me in the right direction??

Thanks a lot

Andy

ps. Whilst tinkering i found this in my .htaccess for the live site-

# -FrontPage-

IndexIgnore .htaccess */.??* *~ *# */HEADER* */README* */_vti*

<Limit GET POST>
order deny,allow
deny from all
allow from all
</Limit>
<Limit PUT DELETE>
order deny,allow
deny from all
</Limit>
AuthName *****
AuthUserFile /home/*****/public_html/_vti_pvt/service.pwd
AuthGroupFile /home/*****/public_html/_vti_pvt/service.grp

Dont remember putting that there....

pps. The clever poeple at hostgator (who took over 2 hours on CHAT to even
understand my issue) deleted the .htaccess file on the test site and
replaced it with a new .htaccess with only this in it-

RewriteEngine Off

ppps. Am i even going down the right path with wanting to have a test and
live environment? I dont want the constant hassle of finding and replacing
in sql exports....

To me that sounds like your host is blocking remote access on your
mysql (if you have cpanel on your VPS take a look at remote mysql).

The things you had in your .htaccess were related to FrontPage nad had
no effect on the issue you're having. Try a php script that connects
to your host  - this might help:

Let us know if the connection is successful,


Hope that helps.

Leaving port 3306 wide open is generally a bad idea.  You'll eventually 
be hacked or have a slow mysql server due to all the servers out there 
continuously trying passwords.

What you are trying to do will work. IF you really want to do this test, 
figure out your hostgator IP address and then contact wired tree and 
then can setup a iptables rule to open 3306 for only that server on your 
vps.  Additionally you'll need to make sure that you are able to make 
the out bound connection from the hostgator side.  It is likely blocked 
by default.  If you have ssh access on your host gator account, I would 
use mysql from the command line to make sure that part is working before 
trying to diagnose more wide ranging issues.

Beyond that you'll need to post to the support forums for help with a 
better definition of what you mean by an infinite loop...

Hope that helped.

by the sounds of it, You're trying to use the same database and tables on
the live as the test site?
If so, the only possible way that you could be getting a redirection should
be through the canonical code, and even then, it won't cause a infinite
redirect, nor will it redirect based on hostname.

Try defining WP_SITEURL & WP_HOME for the local install since it's URL
differs to that in your database.. see how you go..

Well since there is already a ticket for this, and i already have the code
for my plugins, I decided to attach the diff and see what happens.

Do a backtrace so you know what functions are being called.  I
recommend installing xdebug[1] on your development machine so that
your error messages include the backtrace.

Thank you for your suggestions.

I tested the remote connection with the script you mentioned madalin and it
was successful.

I also then (DIon) defined WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME in the test site as the
url of the live site.

However i am still getting the following error-

Error 310 (net::ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS): There were too many redirects.

(which is what i meant by an infinite loop Brian).

I wonder if it has something to do with the domain mapping plugin as when i
go to the test url it tries to forward me to
http://TESTURL/wp-signup.php?new=TESTURL

Obviously that will never work...

I will indeed go to the support forums unless anyone has any further
suggestions based on the above?

I have struggled to find any info online regarding multisite & remote
database. Does anyone know of a site with info on this?

Thanks a lot

Andy

That needs to be the URL of the testsite in the test site. In the live site
that'll be populated automatically from the database.

However, It appears that you're running a Multisite install given that
redirect? If so,  you might be completely out of luck here.. I dont know
enough about the multisite redirection code, but it seems that some details
might not be correct.

You could fake being the live site by modifying $_SERVER['HOST']; on the
test site's wp-config.php to make WordPress believe it is the live server..
that's all I can think of right now.

Thank you Dion. I also tried it with the test site url.. No luck...

I was worried about that.... I figured the lack of info online meant
multisite with remote db just isnt possible... Thats a real shame.

I will try that.

I will continue trying and will let you know what i find.

What do others do for a test (by this i actually mean an environment i can
both develop and test on) environment? I would prefer to do it locally of
course but multisite wont work on localhost... Any ideas greatly
appreciated!

Thanks

The other suggestion is to set the local server to have the same url as the
public server.. use a Proxy PAC file to use 127.0.0.1 as a proxy for *.
livesite.com, end result would be 2 server which believe they're the live
site, but when the proxy settings are in effect, all requests for hte live
site are delivered locally..
Only other solution I can think of..

I think your problem is not multisite with a remote db, but one installation
of wordpress using the data of another installation.
But see below.

Just modify your hosts file. Add a line like
127.0.0.1 myfakedomain.com sub2.myfakedomain.com sub3.myfakedomain.com sub4,
myfakedomain.com

and you can set up multisite and even play with subdomains (it'll complain
about not being able to access randomchars.myfakedomain.com, but will let
you carry on).

I use a local multisite install with a local domain for development and
testing. You can do it pretty easily if you use subfolders instead of
subdomains, but you do have to use port 80 for Apache as WordPress doesn't
allow you to have a port number in the URL. There are some tutorials out
there to help you get going on whatever OS you use - I won't claim to be an
expert by any means.

I concur with Helen. Also, I've used multisite locally with the domain 
mapping plugin successfully as well. Just change your hosts file as Mike 
already pointed out.

And furthermore, I've used localhost with the domain mapping plugin to 
map subdomains to subfolders and it worked fine.

Message-ID: <4DA4E5BF.8050408@yahoo.com>

I've implemented the Facebook Like button on a WordPress blog (latest version) and it is posting recommended links to Facebook. However, it's not refreshing dynamically. I must refresh the browser and reload the site to see the updated Like count. Otherwise, when I press the button, it just grays out. Here's the code:

<iframe src="http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=<?php echo urlencode(get_permalink($post->ID)); ?>&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=recommend&amp;font=verdana&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden;
width:450px; height:21px;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>

And the site:

I'd appreciate any suggestions!

Message-ID: <4DA50611.6010004@yahoo.com>

I have .bypostauthor set to provide a tan background color to the 
author's comments. Seemed to be working, until it wasn't.

As you can see in this thread, the .bypostauthor class goes away 
sometime after about about noon today. I didn't make any changes to the 
stylesheet and I've tried disabling plugins, but can't pinpoint the 
cause. Same with the other comments page on this new blog.

http://bit.ly/fM0jhO

My styles for .bypostauthor:
ol.commentlist li.bypostauthor { background:#ebc094 !important; }
ol.commentlist li.comment ul.children li.bypostauthor { 
background:#ebc094 !important; }

I would appreciate any suggestions!

Thanks.

Notice the differences in the classes assigned to your last .bypostauthor
comment, and your first non-.bypostauthor comment:

.bypostauthor:

not .bypostauthor:

Chip. Very astute, and thanks!

I've let the site author know she must log in via admin before 
addressing her audience via the comments form.

This must be a common problem for unsophisticated users. The admin 
doesn't know any different, because WordPress recognizes her Gravatar 
both from the admin page and the comments page, even though she's 
logging in two different ways. I wonder if WP could be made to recognize 
the two different states and serve up the bypostauthor class in each case?

WordPress only has one method of login. One does not "log in" via the
comments form.

If the comments form presents the author fields (Name, Email, Website), then
the current user isn't logged in; otherwise, the comment form would consist
solely of the comment textarea.

The Gravatar comes from email alone. If the user provides the same email in
the comment form as the one configured in that user's profile, the Gravatar
will be the same.

Hey Alex,

You'll want to use get_post_type() in a conditional loop. See http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags#A_Post_Type

post_type_exists().

It was called is_post_type() for a bit during the 3.0 cycle, but we renamed
it. http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13747

If you're looking for the post type of a post, use is_singular( $post_type )
or get_post_type( $post ).

== 'podcast' or whatever as needs be!

One thing you can do is add a login link in the comment form next to
the name field, reminding users to log in before commenting. Not
always ideal depending on your ratio of authors to general public, as
people without logins might be confused that they can't log in.

Subject: [wp-hackers] only one settings_section per one custom settings page?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=who4Mrk0vUzG3v844BaFBBr2bTg@mail.gmail.com>

hello

i thought that i understand how to create custom settings page in new
way, but abviously not :)

please look at this code:
http://wklej.org/id/512305/

this code creates custom settings page named 'Ustawienia Biebrza.com'
and add to it two sections:
- sekcja_boksiki (line 19.)
- sekcja_tabimpr (line 34.)

everything looks great (please check:
http://awesomescreenshot.com/00bbbhbde ) but it doesnt work :)

when i want to update smth in (lower) section sekcja_tabimpr it is
updated. but if i change smth in (upper) section sekcja_boksiki,
nothing is changed

i thing this is a problem with lines 76-77:
<?php settings_fields( 'sekcja_boksiki' ); ?>
<?php settings_fields( 'sekcja_tabimpr' ); ?>

those lines creates hidden form fields for those sections. but fields
pritned by second line overwite some values from fields printed by
first setting_fields

how to add two sections to one page?

i tried to replace problematic lines with:
settings_fields( 'sekcja_boksiki', 'sekcja_tabimpr' )
or
settings_fields( array('sekcja_boksiki', 'sekcja_tabimpr') )

but it doesnt work

Subject: [wp-hackers] Filters or action hooks: After media is uploaded
Message-ID: <BANLkTimvL_bxz0LuU2i-ZLj2MHQaJxbORQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a plugin that uses custom posts, and I want to utilize the
default WP media upload Thickbox pop-up, but I need to be able to change
what is displayed after the files are uploaded.

Being a visual person, I thought a good screenshot might be more helpful:
http://www.tobiaslabs.com/?attachment_id=626

If you are more of a word person: On the "Add Media" pop-up, once you've
selected "Select Files" and after the files are uploaded, a nice bit of
screen slides in to show fields you could change (title, content, etc.). I
need to customize that area, removing or replacing the default fields with
options specific to the plugin.

Any thoughts appreciated.

hello Chip

i read your tutorial (long but efficient!) and i understand that every
options from one options page i have to store in one array, yes? you
did it in this way, that option has name 'theme_oenology_options' and
every setting is array data inside this option (eg
['header_nav_menu_position'] ).

this is the only way to that? cannot i store difffrent settings in
diffrent fields in database?

i ask beacause i am prepering to change my code to fill your rules.
but if i can omit to rearrange way how data is stored will be faster
:)

Storing all of your options in a single array is usually much, much
faster than trying to store them all separately.

Ok so I have this third-party library that's an SDK for a web service API.
The library is not explicitly given a license, instead it says this:

I want to include this plugin in the WP.ORG extend site, will this be an

There are two hooks (filters)

attachment_fields_to_edit
attachment_fields_to_save

In typical WP fashion like adding to the taxonomy term and user you don't have complete control. You can add fields via the 'attachment_fields_to_edit' filter. But for example you cannot alter the default. Hope this gets you started.

Hi,
     That is an explicit license and it is GPL compatible I suspect as it
looks like it's MIT or modified BSD. So it should be fine.

That reads like the MIT (or Expat) license which is compatible with
the GNU GPL. Therefore it should be fine to include that in a plugin.

That's the MIT license, which is considered GPL-compatible and perfectly
acceptable for WordPress.org plugins. It's what many of my projects are
released under.

I think http://api.wordpress.org/ has a method to query the

Anybody able to fill me in?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Equalheight columns css breaks comments in single.php
Message-ID: <4DA9D137.1050203@yahoo.com>

I'm directing this to the WP group because it involves single.php.

Here's an equalheight columns css trick that works with the BluePrint 
CSS grid system (and I'm presuming with other sites as well) that works 
/almost/ flawlessly with my WordPress site:

|.equal-height{
     overflow:hidden;
     }

.equal-height>  div{
     padding-bottom:32767px;
     margin-bottom:-32767px;
     }
|

Worked great, that is, until it broke the WordPress single.php template 
(in this case, with two columns inside a wrapper div). WP sees the 
comments queue as the top of the page and all content above disappears.

Is there any way to compensate for this and make single.php display 
correctly with equalheight?

Thanks.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Setting custom taxonomy on the fly
Message-ID: <4DAB1A1E.2070406@gunters.org>

I'm currently working on a theme, and one of the things I wanted to do 
is to automatically set the Post Format when using an XML-RPC client. 
This isn't currently supported by the WordPress for iPhone app, for 
example, so I was trying to hack around it by looking for a string at 
the beginning of a post, something like:

   :status: Watching the game and drinking a beer. Life is good.

I was going to detect the ':status:' string, remove it from 
post_content, update the post on the fly, and set the post format.

But I keep running into roadblocks.

For one thing, in class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php, the mw_newPost() method 
doesn't do any filtering of the supplied data. This would be the ideal 
place for me to do what I want, because I could theoretically just add a 
'tax_input' key to the post data that is passed into wp_insert_post(), 
and everything would just be magic from there. I suggest adding a new 
filter after the data is compacted into the $postdata array, and before 
it is passed to wp_insert_post();

Similarly, another opportunity would be is if there was a filter in 
wp_insert_post() after parsing the args, but before the extract() is 
performed. This would give another chance to inject/alter the post data 
before it is processed.

Without a filter in one of those places, it's extremely difficult for a 
plugin or theme to set/change custom taxonomy terms on a post on the 
fly, when the post comes in via XML-RPC.

So that leaves us with just a couple of other opportunities to act: the 
'wp_insert_post_data' filter, and the 'wp_insert_post' action. With the 
filter, I can detect my sentinel string and strip it back out of the 
post, but I can't set the post_format, because we don't have a post_ID 
yet. But if we get all the way to the 'wp_insert_post' action, updating 
the post content to strip out the sentinel is a problem, because using 
wp_update_post() will in turn call wp_insert_post(), which is a 
recursive loop.

One more place where a filter would be useful is when wp_insert_post() 
checks for the $tax_input variable (which would have been included in 
the original $postarr argument passed into the function). A 'tax_input' 
filter which received the post_ID would be another chance to extend the 
ability to manipulate custom taxonomies on the fly, at post creation time.


(I've also posted this as a Trac ticket: 
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17156)

Why not just use both?

add_filter('wp_insert_post_data','strip_content');
function strip_content($data) {
  global $my_format;
  // detect format in $data['post_content'] and modify it
  // set $my_format = detected-format;
  return $data;
}

add_action('wp_insert_post','add_format');
function add_format($post_ID) {
  global $my_format;
  set_post_format($post_ID, $my_format);
}

That's the work-around I came up with. It's just uglier than it needs to 
be. An appropriately placed filter would make this much easier for 
developers in the future. And if it was a filter on the arguments before 
the extract() in wp_insert_post(), it would be generic enough to handle 
arbitrary custom taxonomies (not just post formats), just by adding the 
'tax_input' key to the array, with appropriate term data.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Including only excerpt in search
Message-ID: <BANLkTim43YL_DG0o2qOM66YNAis+JOufhg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a custom post type that I only use the excerpt field, not the
content.

So I want WP to be able to search inside this excerpt field (post_excerpt in
DB)

I've tried several combinations with pre_get_posts filter but nothing yet!

function filter_search($query) {
    if ($query->is_search) {
$query->set('post_type', array('post', 'pages','produtos','artistas'));
 add_filter('the_content', 'excerpt');
    };
    return $query;
};
add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'filter_search');

function excerpt($content) {
$content = get_the_excerpt();
return $content;
}

Somebody help-me!

Maybe you use some unoptimized plugin or theme,
because wp core is well optimized.
This could be detected via debugger or profiler.

i've adapted this from the codex[1], i haven't tested it so let me know if
it works.

add_filter( 'posts_where', 'my_search_where' );

function my_search_where( $where ) {
    if ( is_search() ) {
      $where = preg_replace(
         "/\(\s*post_title\s+LIKE\s*(\'[^\']+\')\s*\)/",
         "(post_title LIKE $1) OR (post_excerpt LIKE $1)", $where );
    }

    return $where;

}

you could also use the relevanssi plugin[2], which has an option for
searching excerpts (as well as a whole bunch of other stuff that massively
improves the search).

Nope, dont worked. I also examined the source code of relevance to see if I
can extract only that code, but not found anything near that.

Also I've previously read that link on codex that u send, nothing referring
to excerpt.

Thanks anyway!

the regular expression was failing, this now works for me:

add_filter( 'posts_where', 'my_search_where' );

function my_search_where( $where ) {

    if ( is_search() ) {
    $where = preg_replace(
    "/post_title\s+LIKE\s*(\'[^\']+\')/",
    "post_title LIKE $1) OR (post_excerpt LIKE $1", $where );
    }

    return $where;

}

relevanssi works on a very different basis: it generates a table of indexed
terms which is updated when you save a post, and it then searches that table
rather than searching the posts table.

Hi,

if you're willing to pay you can go to jobs.wordpress.net ,

Otherwise can I suggest the obvious, the wordpress.org

Thanks Duncan and Mihai,

I want to pay, I have already done all that was in my power, and it
simply is impossible for me to do it all.

So if I did not make it clear enough, for professional help I meant, I
want to pay for someone to solve this pain in the rear for me.

Thanks for the links!

Duplication refers to a student being accepted by multiple projects. Those
are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

No need to be available in IRC, though idling in that channel is in general
a good idea. If we're looking for feedback, we'll post a comment on your
proposal.

Hi wp-hackers,

I'm a high school computer science teacher and I often have students who
want to hack on things like WordPress or other open-source projects, but
they don't see a path from where they are to that goal.

So I started a web site for sharing how and why people started programming.
Will you share your story? http://ilearnedtoprogram.com

As the site has gotten more entries, I've been reminded of a bunch of fun
things from my childhood. Maybe you'll enjoy a trip down memory lane as
well.

Thanks for the heads up... fixed it using this:

I had forgotten to consider very short screen sizes.

Thanks also to so many of you for sharing your stories... it's really cool
to see, like Otto mentioned, people who came up on C64 and Apple II. I think
each generation has it's toys that teach. I wonder what kids growing up
today will talk about when they're old... =)

Subject: [wp-hackers] 500 Internal server error due to PHP APC?
Message-ID: <BANLkTim211AXWLOozCZe5yuugcaGZ=wO5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have just moved my Wordpress to UBuntu 10.04 LTS, using the default
Apache / PHP/ APC.

I found that if I enable APC, Wordpress will die randomly after some
visits - It is okay when I restarted my Apache and just after some
visits, blank screen will be shown.

When I added "php_flag apc.cache_by_default Off" in the .htaccess,
problems solved, so this is due to Wordpress and APC?

Any idea to solve?

Thanks.

What is the error code you get in your server logs? Also have you turned
debugging on in WP? If so what error do you see when the site crashes?

I can only see error code is 500 from the access log, error log showing nothing.

(I have enabled log_errors ON in php.ini)

$wpdb->prepare() is a wrapper around sprintf();
If you wish to use %'s inside the SQL, you'll need to escape them.

You're probably looking for this:
  $where .= $wpdb->prepare("AND post_title LIKE '%s%%' ", $keyword);

I'm late to the game but I just want to say: This is exactly right and would
be a huge improvement to the semantic usability of the
conditionals/templates involved.

As soon as WP had these two conditionals existing at the same time it was a
problem. There should never have been two flags like this with such
obviously redundant names. "home" and "front_page" refer to the exact same
thing here (the root of the domain/landing page up on arrival), even if the
code has them doing different things. As you point out it's almost funny and
ironic that the only functional difference between the two is that one of
them specifically applies when the home/front-page *meaning* is inverted and
you are not on the 'homepage' of the site.

is_home should have been changed to is_posts or is_posts_index as soon as
front_page was added, or preferably, home could have been used as
'front-page' and a 'posts index' could have been the 'new'
template/conditional that was added, which would have made sense!
Unfortunately at the time they seem to have been focussing on the
functionality rather than the semantics, which is a lesson for the future if
nothing else.

FWIW since those days there has been really high-quality debates around
these kinds of semantic issues when new stuff is added, and the result is a
lot less naming madness. Even if you don't like how naming in the
CPT/Multisite etc. areas have gone down, they were discussed deeply and the
results are usually workable if not ideal for everyone.

I think having a ticket about the subject would be good, as the issue will
never go away until someone is willing to deprecate "*home*" as used in this
context. IMHO a nice long deprecation period should make it not-unreasonable
to one day be rid of it, and cleaning up the core code would probably make
it a lot easier to understand (since the labels would make more sense)

That said I doubt you'd get much committer traction. The current situation
is seen as workable because WP is popular despite it, and there is little
love for purely semantic changes to core most of the time.

I think the problem is that the committers might not be "in the trenches"
enough to see that a nomenclature problem *does* exist. I see the confusion
occasionally in Themes submitted to the repository. (I see it *far* more
often in the code of so-called "premium" Themes and in sketchy free Themes
that I occasionally have the displeasure of reviewing.) I see it in the
WPORG support forums, by end users.

Maybe I'll put in a ticket, and see what discussion develops...

Yeah I also doubt there will be traction from core even if someone submits a patch. Things like this should be addresses but if you don't build/review themes all the time you just don't see it as a problem.

Automatic makes every employee get in on support. Why doesn't every core committee have to review a certain number of themes?

Subject: [wp-hackers] Best practices for hunting depreciated functions.
Message-ID: <BANLkTin3pHvx9gHzt8NFCa4BsC1yXLDsnA@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I attempted my first plugin.
As part of the debugging process I turned on debugging so that I could
keep one ssh session open with a tail on the error log -- thus showing
me any errors and warnings.

To my surprise any warnings and/or errors generated by my fledgling
plugin were buried deep in a morass of warnings about depreciated
functions.

First of all let me say that the plugins I am using are pretty main
stream. These are plugins found on most of the "Top Ten" lists. I'm a
little disappointed that some of these plugins persist in using
functions depreciated many versions back. But that is not my question
at the moment.

My question here is about any tricks of the trade that folks use to
find where a function is actually being used. Most of the error
messages listing depreciated functions. Below are two examples of the
problem that I am running in to.

[Sun Apr 24 11:19:27 2011] [error] [client xx.xx.xx.xx] PHP Notice:
load_plugin_textdomain was called with an argument that is
<strong>deprecated</strong> since version 2.7 with no alternative
available. in /home/xxxx/public_html/wp/wp-includes/functions.php on
line 3389, referer:
http://www.xxxx.com/wp/wp-admin/plugins.php?activate=true&plugin_status=all&paged=1&s=

[Sun Apr 24 11:19:42 2011] [error] [client xx.xx2.xx.xx] PHP Notice:
get_bloginfo was called with an argument that is
<strong>deprecated</strong> since version 2.2! The <code>home</code>
option is deprecated for the family of <code>bloginfo()</code>
functions. Use the <code>url</code> option instead. in
/home/xxxx/public_html/wp/wp-includes/functions.php on line 3387,
referer: http://www.xxxx.com/wp/wp-admin/plugins.php?activate=true&plugin_status=all&paged=1&s=

I double checked wp-includes/functions.php and it is definitely not
using load_plugin_textdomain. :)  In order to find which plugin might
be using the depreciated function call it is necessary to grep my
entire tree looking for any occurrence. I can do this, but it seems
like there must be a debugging option available that would somehow
give a peek into the call stack or in some other way point toward the
function that contains the depreciated element.

Assuming that I find all the plugins that are generating the error
messages, is deactivation of these plugins the only means available to
clean up my error log so that it becomes easier to see those errors
and warnings generated by my code?

I'm assuming other developers have come up against these issues during
development. Hence, I'm assuming there must be standard practices for
dealing with this.

Claude Needham

EXCELLENT idea.  My two cents, using index for consistency and singular post for subtle reference to post_type='post' vs. post_type='%':

is_home() -> is_post_index()
is_posts() -> is_blog_index()
home.php -> post-index.php

I think you might be right.

Hi Claude,

When I'm developing new plugins I run a full mirror of my sites on a localhost to test the plugin across multiple datasets and structures, but the secondary benefit is that I can use the cross file search capacity of my editor to quickly do a bulk search across thousands of files.

I'm 100% sure that you're right, there must be a better way to handle this and I'd love to know how but for me, the fastest way to detect depreciated functions is oddly similar to your own.

I myself found a cool plugin that makes it easy, its called logpress, got it
off codecanyon, cost a couple bucks, but definitely worth it.

It's called backward compatibility. Home was redefined to mean the
blog posts page of the site.

Just because you don't like the naming system is not a good enough
reason to just break everything willy-nilly.

This is true. It's simpler to document a minor naming weirdness than
it is to *break everything else in the world*.

As GLaDOS recently reminded us, the ideal solution to a problem is
usually the easiest one.

Adding is_post_index() to do the same thing that is_home() currently does and then deprecating is_home() in the documentation doesn't break anything willy-nilly.

Just sayin'...

That seems like a reasonable number to be able to port to a more
semantically correct conditional function, without risking "breaking
everything in the world".

I don't know how such things are normally done, but I could foresee:

1) Defining "is_blog()" or "is_posts_index()" (or whatever) exactly as
"is_home()" is currently defined.
2) Re-defining "is_home()" as simply a wrapper for the above conditional.
3) Replacing "is_home()" with the new conditional in the above 13 references
4) Deprecating "is_home()" for some long duration

It seems feasible to me.

Install xdebug [http://www.xdebug.org/] on your development server.  You'll
get both better looking errors and a backtrace for each error (which means
you can see where the error is being called).

Message-ID: <BD903FEC-55B2-4B69-A86A-E568B45E06CB@newclarity.net>

Can someone check my logic here please?  I'm running the following code with WP 3.1 as a standalone test.php and calling the core function current_user_can() with 'edit_page' as it's only parameter, and with WP_DEBUG set to true:

<?php // test.php
define('WP_DEBUG',true);
include( 'wp-load.php' );
header( 'Content-type:text/plain' );
current_user_can('edit_page');

I get the following warnings:
Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in /Users/mikeschinkel/Sites/wp31/public_html/wp-includes/capabilities.php on line 872

Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in /Users/mikeschinkel/Sites/wp31/public_html/wp-includes/capabilities.php on line 874

Am I doing something wrong, or is this indeed a oversight in core that I should submit a trac ticket and patch to fix?

I think you want current_user_can('edit_pages').  edit_page should
include the ID of the page in question, like so:

current_user_can( 'edit_page', $page_id )

Subject: [wp-hackers] User Redirection to Provide users the option to create
	content
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=eAn6y6x0W6=QiBf=bB3=dkm3YQw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a custom post type that has been created with the following fields

   - Textfield - Name
   - Texfield - address
   - textfield - email address
   - textfield - web address
   - checkboxes - amenities (just check off from available amenities)

This allows a user to provide information that will create a profile for
them in WordPress.

I now want to give the user direct access to their post to create / edit.

Originally I planned on giving them admin access and restrict specific
functionality.  Now, after some research and discussions I am going to
redirect them to a form with the same values of the custom post type.  Then
the form will pre-populate with content from the post if it already exists,
if not then the form will be blank.  Once the user fills out all the fields
of the form it will connect to the database and either update the database
or add to the database directly.

My question is, is redirecting the user to a form that directly updates the
database the best solution?  If so any tips, ideas, thoughts, anything that
can help me do this faster and better?

Install the Debug Bar plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/debug-bar/) and Log Deprecated Notices (
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/ )

The first will show you messages in an expand out debug panel linked in the admin bar and trys to determine the actually calling code rather than just print the standard message.
The second will do the same and also provide you with a log view - the debug bar uses code from log deprecated notices to try and determine the callee of the deprecated code from the backtrace.

In the case of your two examples the line of code mentioned is where the error is being detected and raised not where the function is called.

I don't think it is the core code breaking that is the worry. It's all the

Also worth noting that your two examples are deprecated *arguments* not

I'd agree. The current names of the functions are confusing as all get 
out. It's a source for bugs in themes and plugins.  I usually shy away 
from renames but in this case, I'd rather have the clearer names 
available for use.

Down that road lies project paralysis. We would never add any features
or revamp any old/outdated functionality if we had to worry about the
install base.

I don't think folks are arguing for it being easy, rather, for it
being necessary.

Too true.

And, as for "Themes and Plugins  out there in use by millions of sites":
isn't that what *deprecation* is for? Certainly, a "reasonable" deprecation
period in this case would be on the order of years, rather than months. (But
then, isn't that the norm for deprecated WordPress functions?)

That was part of the eye opener for me. Not c64 specifically, but I'm 
really surprised at how  many started at 12/13 and in the 80's (and 
earlier).  (Timex Sinclair/Compaq Portal Plus)

I expected a lot more Visual Basic programmers.  Maybe it's just a

I've gone into Media settings and set a maximum embed width for videos. 
WordPress is completely ignoring these settings, requiring me to 
manually edit the YouTube embed dimensions.

How can I make WordPress respect the media embed settings?

No thanks, Helen. The .org forums are the reason I post my questions here.

I'm leaving the question open and hoping for a positive response.

I think your problem is that you are embedding it. The sizes you set in WP
admin area are only applied to media that is uploaded to your WP
installation. If you are embedding media from an outside source you are
still going to be required to set the dimensions of that media. That means
if you want those dimensions to apply to these videos you need to upload
and stream them through your installation system, not use youtube.

I *think* the setting only applies to media you embed using shortcodes
or by entering the YouTube URL on its own, rather than situations
where you've pasted in the embed code from YouTube.

So, to that end, are you pasting the YouTube embed code in, or are you
pasting just the URL to the YouTube video?

As others have mentioned, that setting may not affect the size of
video embed. But, you can use the [embed] shortcode to do this.

See:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds

Example:

[embed width="123" height="456"]...[/embed]

If you've copied over a whole embed code generated by YouTube, then it's
going to have those dimensions. If you want to use that width from your
settings, try putting just the video URL in plain text on its own line to
take advantage of oEmbed (you'll have to turn on attempting to embed video
URLs if it's not already).

A little CSS could help as well:

.post object, .post embed{
max-width: X;
height: auto;
}

Works wonders for me, and that way I can just paste videos and go.

How embed width works:

1. The global $content_width is the default for width.

2. The settings in Settings->Media->Embeds override that for anything
using oEmbed. This means anything using the [embed] shortcode or the
auto-embeds. Same goes for height.

3. Specifying width/height in the [embed] shortcode overrides even that.

4. This only affects actual embeds, not copy-pasted code from elsewhere.

5. This isn't retroactive. Once the oembed does its magic, the actual
embed code obtained is cached in the postmeta. It won't resize just
because you change the settings again.

Hi RePost:  

If you don't get a good answer on the WordPress support forum you might want to consider asking on StackExchange's WordPress Answers in the future rather than email this list:

Thanks to all for the excellent suggestions. I really appreciate the 
assistance.

Applying the url instead of the embed code, as several folks recommended 
here, is the way to go. I'll apply Mitch's CSS recommendation as a backup.

Thanks, Mike. stackexchange is hit and miss, but a worthy resource.

.org is a nest of vipers. I have no use for it. This forum, on the other 
hand, has been a great source of help, and I appreciate it greatly.

The WPORG support forums are staffed entirely by volunteers from the
community. Your condescending, blanket derision is insulting to the
volunteer community members who try to help there.

If you see room for improvement, the only way to improve it is to pitch in
yourself.

It's absurd that you would suggest that I've never contributed to the 
.org support forum. And I'm not the first person who has innocently 
approached the forum with questions and been driven off by hostility, 
demands for money and overall, indifference.

Defend them all you want, but it doesn't make them any better. The .org 
forums represent the nadir of the WordPress community.

For some of the people on this mail-list, "they" are *we*.

If anyone is demanding money, that is absolutely against the forum rules,
and should be reported.

Saying that on the wp-hackers list, that's pretty rich.

Thank you to so many wp-hackers for participating. The site was on
reddit and metafilter over the weekend and a ton of people saw it.

My reflection on that experience:

Subject: [wp-hackers] PHP Lazy Loading in WordPress 3.2
Message-ID: <4DB64647.6080009@philipwalton.com>

I've heard rumors 
<http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/wordpress-3-2-the-plan-faster-lighter/> 
that WordPress 3.2 will implement lazy loading of PHP classes. Is any of 
this currently incorporated into the latest development version?

I'm writing an MVC plugin framework for my own development projects and 
I wanted to implement lazy loading for my framework, but now I'm worried 
that I might do something that the release of 3.2 will break.

Can anyone shed any light on where this is at or point me in the 
direction of some code in progress so I can see how it's being 
implemented? I've looked around on Trac but haven't seen much. Should I 
wait for 3.2 to incorporate lazy loading or is it still far away?

Philip

I did a lot of work with this last year. To answer your question, YES, if
Wordpress, or any other plugin, is using the __autoload function then errors
will fly.

function __autoload($class_name) {
    include $class_name . '.php';
}

$obj  = new MyClass1();

There can obviously only be one of these classes declared in the rendered
structure. But there is a way around this that will still allow you to
autoload. It's called special autoload or spl_autoload_register. But be
careful, because the special autoloader will override the __autoload class.
So you'd have to write some conditional code like this:

function b ($c) {
  require_once "path-to-your-class-dir/$c.php";
}
spl_autoload_register('b');
if (function_exists('__autoload'))
{
  spl_autoload_register('__autoload');
}

Hopefully that helps.

If we do any lazy loading, we're not going to use __autoload().
Possibly spl_autoload_register()
(which can't be relied on always being available until 5.3). More likely
we're just going to try to load a little less PHP whenever possible through
other creative means.

I've been working on it, but for now I'm just studying various ways we can
actually lower our memory footprint. There will probably be a ticket created
this week.

I'm just curious if this is a bug, or something else.

I'm creating a custom search form, and it passes variables into a hidden input filed that contains a comma-separated list of category IDs. it seemed to be working just fine (searching in the categories I've designated) until I came to a search where I *knew* that certain posts should show up from between two categories. I then realized that even though my hidden input field contained the proper format (and the category ID's were being passed as they should to the query), the query was only looking in the first category ID instead of all of them.  

So, for instance, if I have 'input type="hidden" name="cat" value="1.3.5" '

the values of 1, 3, and 5 are being passed (as evidenced by the URL string - it contains "cat=1,3,5") - but it's only searching category 1 and ignoring 3 and 5.

Is this normal behavior? or a bug? or what? Everything I can find says that the input field (as I have it) should make the query use all three category IDs, but it's not. It's passing (even when I print_r the query vars, they show up as expected), but not using.

Anyone know?

I see right off the bat that you have a period instead of commas in your
hidden input. If that doesn't fix it, then you could always try sending
category__in or category__and instead of cat

That's just 'cause I manually typed it in - I wasn't sure if the list would strip out code, so I didn't cut/paste.  The actual code *does* have commas.

I'll try the other stuff and see if it works better.  Thanks!

Thanks Jonathon - but using category__in or category__and makes it ignore *all* the categories, and acts like it's not even there.

I read somewhere recently that this was a little-known bug - that WP wouldn't recognize multiple categories in search anymore, but for the life of me I can't find where I read it.  But no matter how hard I search for it again, all I come up with is that "cat" *should* work with comma-separated values. But it just searches the first and ignores the rest. Even if I manually type in the categories to search, it still ignores all ID's but the first one.

I think you're right, i'm remembering something about category__in __and are
not publicly query-able.

here's the codex, although probably not much help to you at this point.

Gah. Nevermind.  I turned off all my plugins and reverted to default (something I should have done before posting to the list - sorry for that).  it's the plugin I'm using: Relevanssi. For some reason, the plugin interferes and only pays attention to the first ID. I shut it off, and the multiple categories thing works fine. Which sucks. 'cause it's a good plugin!

Thanks anyway :)

Well first suggestion is to try debugging this via your search.php template. Dump the $wp_query. Check to see it the categories are being set. Also, might want to try adding this via a filter. Inside that function you should be able to grab you form variable and make sure it uses your search terms. Of course per other suggestions you can change the 'cat' to 

function mySearchFilter($query) 
{
   if ($query->is_search)
   {
      $query->set('cat','1,2,3');
   }
   return $query;
}
add_filter('pre_get_posts','mySearchFilter');

according to relevanssi's options screen & documentation it does accept
comma-separated category lists, for restriction and/or exclusion. if it
doesn't seem to be working it's worth writing a post on the support forums
as mikko is usually very responsive and quick to put out bugfixes if it does
turn out to be a bug.

Yes, I know, which is why I was surprised that it was the issue.  And I've already written him :)

Thanks!

Subject: [wp-hackers] TinyMCE editor with no localization strings in
	WordPress
Message-ID: <BANLkTim8UAxM-Z0zic9u23BfRQe0NervZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,
I've got a problem with the WordPress editor.
I want to include it on a WordPress plugin but I cannot understand how to
load localization strings.
As you can see on the picture below I see the textual placeholder (as
'advanced.underline_desc', 'advanced.fontdefault'...).

Below that's how I coded. Where I was wrong?

Thank you very much,
Carlo

----------------------------
add_action('init', 'optionsConfigStart', 1);
add_action('admin_footer', 'MCEditorReplacer');
...
function optionsConfigStart(){

 wp_enqueue_script('tiny-mce',includes_url('js/tinymce').'/tiny_mce.js','','','',false);
}
...
function MCEditorReplacer(){
include_once(ABSPATH.WPINC.'/js/tinymce/langs/wp-langs.php');
$mce_locale=(''==get_locale())?'en':strtolower(substr(get_locale(),0,2));?>
<script type="text/javascript">
tinyMCE.init({
theme : "advanced",
 mode: "exact",
skin: "wp_theme",
 language: "<?php echo $mce_locale;?>",

 elements : "description_text",
theme_advanced_toolbar_location : "top",

I've used this before

able to reverse engine it from that plugin

Thanks both I (half) arranged with just a row; after:

wp_enqueue_script('tiny-mce',includes_url('js/tinymce').'/tiny_mce.js','','','',false);

I added:

wp_enqueue_script('tiny-mce-lang',includes_url('js/tinymce').'/langs/wp-langs-en.js','','','',false);

and now it works perfectly with plain english translation.

I'm still working to use Italian localization (as my customer requested).

Another thing I corrected in my script is to hook 'optionsConfigStart' no
more to 'init' but to 'admin_print_scripts', as it cointains just a script
queue.

Thanks a lot, I go further to understand how to use the localized version.
If anyone has a suggestion, it's really welcome.

Thanks,
Carlo

Ok, the raw solution was easy.
I just had to download tinymce languages from here:

http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/i18n/index.php?ctrl=lang&act=download&pr_id=1

and copy them under:

/wp-includes/js/tinymce/

I'm sure it will exists a better solution, I'll investigate further but for
now it fills the hole.

Many thanks,
Carlo

Have a look in wp-admin/includes/post.php (near the end) at how core 
loads TinyMCE. The translation strings are loaded after tiny_mce.js and 
there's a small script that runs after all plugins are loaded to tell 
tmce not to look for separate translation files.

Also TinyMCE should be loaded in the footer, no need to slow the page load.

Does anyone know how I can remove the boxes that appear on the page to add a
 newpost? The boxes that I speak are those that appear on the right side,
for example "categories ", tags, image highlight "... I also refer to the
boxes that appear below thepost field," summary "," custom fields "and
others that are inserted through plugin orCPT.

I tried using the function remove_page_menu, without success, do not know
whichparameter to indicate to remove the menus.

Can anyone help?

If you are referring to the Category and Tags boxes you need to call remove_meta_box. Look it up. 


function remove_default_categories_box() {
    remove_meta_box('categorydiv', 'post', 'side');
}
add_action( 'admin_head', 'remove_default_categories_box' );

Actually just found how to do this a week ago. Glad to share.

I have a client who lost their site to a hack (a bad programmer not intruder). Somehow some of the DB references to many of the attachments in the /uploads/ folder are missing. Meaning for any given file under /uploads/ some are  and some are not WP. Would rather not purge everything and reload the tree. Mainly because I would loose the parent association of the current one. And yes there are some 5k attachments in the uploads tree. 

I know there is a function to look up a post/page given the path. But wondering if anyone knows of a way to check if a given file is an attachment?

I know I can load all attachments then check the attachment_url to the path of the file. But to do that for every file seems inefficient.

It worked! I had tried to remove the pits with the method remove_meta_box ()
 and not had success, the difference is that the action that called my
function was not theadmin_menu admin_head.

Can you tell me how can I get a list with the ID of the standard boxes of
WordPress?And with respect to non-standard, those created with plugins,
knows a simple way to getthe ID?

Thank you for your help!

Um. Well fire up FF and use Firebug to look up the ID of the wrapper around the metabox if what I did. For example the post tag div id is 'tagsdiv-post_tag'. OR you can trace through the WP core code in /wp-admin/includes/meta-boxes.php and see how the add_meta_box function is setting the div.

Standard boxes (and more info about using the add_meta_boxes instead of
admin_head hook):
http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/04/13/uncluttering-the-post-editing-screen-in-wordpress

Don't know of any way to get a list of all those IDs besides the suggestion
to look up the ID in the source, though.

Thanks guys, I managed to remove all looking at the ID code in the box,
firebug them lol.As for using the admin_head or add_meta_box, what
advantages and disadvantages ofeach? The add_meta_box suggested a call to
add is not to remove, but runs like the time to assemble the page if you use
 the remove_meta_box within the function itremoves too.

Direct copy paste from the previous link:

I would?ve recommended the admin_menu hook to remove meta boxes, which is
what many developers seem to use and is the example hook provided in the
WordPress Codex. However, not all meta boxes can be removed when using this
hook. The featured image meta box is one such meta box.

Humm, before posting here I was trying to remove the pits with the hook
admin_menuand worked perfectly to remove the menus on the right side, but
when inserted in theremove_meta_box function to remove the box they do not
leave at all, will see the problem was I was trying to remove a box that was
 not possible to remove this hook.

The fact is that with admin_head am having difficulty removing all that was
needed.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Class conflicts with plugin frameworks
Message-ID: <4DB89AB8.3090302@philipwalton.com>

I'm in the beginning stages of writing a basic MVC plugin development 
framework, and I'm realizing I'm going to have a naming conflict issue. 
If I want to include this framework in several of the plugins and/or 
themes I'm developing, eventually I'm going to run into an issue that 
class_exists() isn't going to solve.

I could create the framework as a stand-alone plugin, but that would 
require anyone who downloaded one of my plugins or themes to also 
download the framework, which doesn't seem realistic (especially for 
upgrades to existing plugins that don't have such a dependency currently).

Anyway, I figured many of you out there have probably run into these 
same issues, and I wanted to see if anyone had developed a good strategy 
to manage the problem.

I've found that the simplest approach to MVC is the best. I have my mvc
functions included in a single file that I call bootstrap.php. All of the
functions within this class are wrapped in individual function_exist
statements. Also, there's no hard coded paths or names in any of the
functions.

For example my controller function reads in models from the models folder
and views from the views folder, but the only hard-coded path is the theme
path for over rides. So what I did is have each plugin preset its models and
views folders. That way the controller will actually look through all of the
plugins models and views files before returning the appropriate model or
view. I just prefix each model or view with a three char string like, twc-.

prefixing every function, constant and global with the same three chars
throughout each plugin has eliminated 99% of conflicts. total widget control
runs perfectly along side hundreds of installed plugins. Open up a copy of
total widget controls code and have a look at my bootstrap file, snag it out
if you want.

Yeah, see, prefixing everything manually is exactly what I don't want to 
do, perhaps it's the only way, but I'm hoping to find a better solution.

I was thinking it could be possible to dynamically prefix the classes in 
some sort of init() function that each plugin calls, but I haven't 
experimented with this at all.

I didn't prefix anything that dealt with the mvc framework as I use these
functions throughout all my plugins. It's just the custom plugin functions
that I prefix.

In every plugin exists my bootstrap file which preloads the mvc framework.
That's what you were wanting to do, no?

Jonathan, that IS what I'm wanting to do. Perhaps you can point to me to 
another one of your plugins so I can compare and see exactly what you're 
suggesting.

This is going to vary depending on what exact data is corrupt/missing.
If it's the Image Metadata(postmeta), then that's the only thing that ties
an upload file to a attachment post - You might be able to reverse-engineer
it based on year&month of the attachment, and it's sanitized name..

If it's the above case, i'd do something akin to this:
foreach file in folders
   if is a resized filename; Delete it, continue.
   get month and year from folder names
   get sanitized filename from filename
   Search for attachments which match this; if none found, add it to the
manual list
   If a match was found, run the WordPress generate metadata code for that
Attachment ID and filename.. (Note: I'm not sure how it's going to handle
running on already existing attachments, etc) - That should re-generate the
thumbnails and add all the correct metadata
endforeach;

Of course.. The clients backup service is where this should come into play..
restore the Database.. If they don't have a backup service from their host,
consider setting up a database backup nightly to a off-server location, or
invest in a VaultPress account (or similar if there are any competing
services out yet)

The best way is to just do a
if ( ! class_exists('myclass') ) include framework.php.

of course, if you only want to include the latest version, i'd do something
such as :(ie. this copy of hte plugin includes version 31 of the framework)
in global scope upon plugin inclusion:
$GLOALS[mvcversion] = max (   $GLOALS[mvcversion], 31 )
add_action plugins_loaded:
    if ( 31 ==   $GLOALS[mvcversion] &&  ! class_exists('myclass')  ) //This
plugin has the latest version, and it's not already included
         include framework.php.

That does require you instantiate the rest of the code later, but thats a
good thing to do regardless. based on the above code, that could be hooked
to plugins_loaded early, and a hook on plugins_loaded late could include the
main class files (ie. the files which rely on the framework). This turns the
main plugin file into a meer bootstrap file for setting up the environment.
I'd probably put a activation callback in there too to check server
requirements/etc too

That is a pretty nifty method right there. Consider it borrowed. Thanks Dion.

..Wow i re-read that and see i spent Globals wrong :) - That was
psuedo-written php, I would never not quote a string like that!
I've used a similar functionality to what i wrote below in the past, As long
as the frameworks are back-compatible (ie. those written for version 28 are
compatible with 31) you have no problem. The hardest part is keeping the
framaework up to date in the plugins you're releasing (a svn:external is
ideal for this, unfortunately (for security & code archival reasons i guess)
this isn't possible on WordPress.org hosted plugins)

Subject: [wp-hackers] Need help with query_posts and custom post types
Message-ID: <BANLkTik7hh8KkDSEAk69ttabmRhQvxkS1g@mail.gmail.com>

This is my first post to wp-hackers.
Trying to use query_posts() to create a custom page through a custom rewrite
with the following arguments:

$args = array (

'post_type' => 'iphone_apps',
'year' => '2011',
'monthnum' => '4',
'day' => '13',
'posts_per_page' => '5',
'cat' => '5'

);

It's creating the following sql query:

> SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.*
> FROM wp_posts
> INNER JOIN wp_term_relationships
> ON (wp_posts.ID = wp_term_relationships.object_id)
> WHERE 1=1
> AND YEAR(wp_posts.post_date)='2011'
> AND MONTH(wp_posts.post_date)='4'
> AND DAYOFMONTH(wp_posts.post_date)='13'
> AND ( wp_term_relationships.term_taxonomy_id IN (5) )
> AND wp_posts.post_type IN ('post', 'articles', 'nav_menu_item',
> 'iphone_apps', 'ipad_apps', 'mac_apps')
> AND (wp_posts.post_status = 'publish' OR wp_posts.post_author = 1 AND
> wp_posts.post_status = 'private')
> GROUP BY wp_posts.ID ORDER BY wp_posts.post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 5


Seems to be including all post types rather than the one inserted?

Purpose of doing this: the plugin I'm creating for a site is to
run independent of the theme. Trying to avoid the creation of empty pages.

Any advice?

I wonder if you could do something like this in each plugin:

class myplugin_mvc {
	include (bootstrap.php)
}

Does that work in PHP?  If it does you could use the exact same bootstrap.php file in each plugin, but each plugin would be calling it in the process of creating its own class.

Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier. you can download the plugin from
http://www.totalwidgetcontrol.com

There's a ton of code within twc, but with the simple controller that I use
it looks relatively small and simple. Just the way it should be :) The
reason that I never did if ! function_exists include php file, is because my
I wanted to keep the bootstrap file small for each plugin. So I would add
and remove functions from the bootstrap as needed.

Have a look at the show_view function within the bootstrap and also have a
look at the small codex I was building on totalwidgetcontrol.com It will
help explain how I was using it.

Totally not trying to throw out a "Plug" here about TWC. I really don't care
about promoting anything I'm just trying to help.

you should try running this without using the query_posts as this function
is global and is a custom-ed to remembering prior queries. If you REALLY
want to use it this way, then run wp_reset_query() to clear the query_vars
prior.

I suggest that you do this instead.

$args = array (
'post_type' => 'iphone_apps',
'year' => '2011',
'monthnum' => '4',
'day' => '13',
'posts_per_page' => '5',
'cat' => '5'
);

$apps = new WP_Query;
$apps->query( $args );
global $post;

if ( $apps->have_posts() ) { while ( $apps->have_posts() ) {
$apps->the_post();
//now you can use $post as normal

}}

It was the other plugins, I was making different more bone-headed errors
that I was trying to track. Fortunately I'm having good luck with the
debugger plugin. Very helpful.

Message-ID: <BANLkTin_xHtWTpjRb49xK719DaOojj4SGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Our current plugin has over ten releases, some major and some minor.  For
most of the versions the plugin options have remained the same. We keep the
default settings in an array. When the plugin is initially activated we add
the defaults using add_option.  Here's an example of the array.
$default_setings = array(

"setting1" => "on",

"setting2" => "This is a text field"

)

Now we are coming out with another version of the plugin, and we're adding
more settings, and creating the upgrade function.  Writing the function to
trigger on the upgrade is not a problem.  However, we're having an issue
figuring out the best way to upgrade the actual settings.  The new
default_settings array would look like this:
$default_setings = array(

"setting1" => "on",

"setting2" => "This is a text field",
"setting3" => "style1"

)

First we thought we could just run the default_settings array on upgrade as
well using update_option. This would ignore setting1 and setting2 since they
already exist and just add setting3.  However, if the user decides to
uncheck setting1 or delete the text in setting2, running update_option will
add them back in using the defaults.

We're planning on adding lots of new options in future versions, so creating
different settings arrays for each version seems a bit tedious.

If anyone has any best practices or examples on how to implement this, I
would appreciate it.

Thanks
Steve

It's probably not best practice, but why don't you keep your current
setting/installation configuration, then append the extra details to the
array when an upgrade is performed using array_merge?

Hi Sean,

Thanks for the suggestion. The issue is that we are going to release future
versions with different settings and defaults, and we don't know which
version the user is upgrading from, so we would have to keep each default
settings array in all future versions.  I was hoping for a cleaner solution.

Apologies, I misunderstood. But this idea kind of still holds, after a merge
of new settings, you can delete any non standard elements from the array, by
collecting keys not in your set of current keys and removing them. As I
said, this idea is probably not optimal.

Steve, as long as you're only adding additional items to your option in 
future releases, using wp_parse_args() against the defaults should 
always work. If a user has old settings stored in the database (meaning 
they are missing the new items in the options array), they will be 
seamlessly merged with the new defaults and updated the next time the 
user saves.

This gets a little tricky when you're not just adding a new item but you 
want to change the way an old item is used. In such cases I'd recommend 
creating a new item entirely and deprecating the old one. That will give 
you the ability to check if a deprecated item is still stored in the 
options table and allow you to deal with it or (if absolutely necessary) 
inform the user in an admin alert that they need to update their options 
because of new functionality.

Philip

Leo, when save_post is called you can check the status and send emails accordingly.

I use this code for a similar task (on publish in my case but you should be able to modify it quick enough.

function send_report($post) {

	extract($_POST);
	if ($_POST['post_status'] == 'publish' && $_POST['post_type'] == 'post') {

		//blah		

	}
}
add_action('save_post', 'send_report');

Thank you Christopher! I have not used save_post because I thought the post
beforesending stayed as pending, so many emails were sent while the user
writes the post, butforgot about the draft, while we're actually writing the
 post as a draft and is only earning the status of pending when sent for
review, thanks!

It sounds like you have a check against current_user_can() in the code that
uses the input from your metabox as well as in the metabox itself. Did you
check that part as well?

You may also want to try logging in with a different browser, it might be a
bug with the cookies or something.

As to your general situation, you should try to only register the metabox
when the user deserves to see it, rather than registering it for all then
unregistering for certain people. Ideally both sides of the management
(frontend metabox and backend handler) should be set to run only when the
user has the right capabilities, since otherwise unprivileged users could
accidentally delete information when your form handler recieves none of the
fields it expected from the metabox.

Steve, seems like you're understanding this wrong to begin with. You
don't need to add new options to the array and store them in some kind
of upgrade path. You need to change the point at where you get the
options to begin with to consider the default settings, for all cases
across the board. wp_parse_args will let you do that.

Consider a default set of settings:

$some_defaults = array(
'foo'=>'bar',
'alice'=>'bob'
);

Now, instead of storing the defaults in the database, you change where
you use the get_option to begin with to be like this:

$options = wp_parse_args(get_option('my_options'), $some_defaults);

The resulting $options will be a merge of the two, with anything not
in the my_options array being replaced with the stuff from
$some_defaults. You can store this result later using an update_option
if you want.

But you do this everywhere you get the option from the DB. This way,
you're doing the defaults on the retrieval and don't need to ever
handle "upgrading" at all. The defaults will be used if they're not
set in the db options row.

Hi Otto,

Maybe I'm not explaining correctly:

In v1.0 of plugin we have a simple default setting:
$default_setings = array( "setting1" => "This is some default text", "setting2"
=> "foo" )

The user chooses to delete the default text from their options,  so
"setting1" doesn't exist in the array anymore.

The user now upgrades to v2.0 of our plugin.  It has some more settings, and
I use wp_parse_args to merge the options.  Since "setting1" is empty, won't
wp_parse_args add the default text to the array? If yes, then this is the
issue since the user removed the default text.  This also happens when check
boxes are checked on default, and then unchecked by user.

Thanks
Steve

How do I register for a just Metabox certain level of user? I'm using a
custom class to generate the goal box Metabox and do not know which
parameter set the user levelwould have access to this box.

Instead of removing setting1 from the array, you should leave it in
the array as a blank string.

"Defaults" are *default*. That's what gets used when no entry exists.
If they've specified something other than the default, even a blank
string, then you should be storing it as what they are specifying,
even if it's a blank string.

Ditto for checkboxes. You should be storing them as a boolean true or
false, and saving the false condition instead of deleting it from the
options array.

Subject: [wp-hackers] Attaching files to posts
Message-ID: <BANLkTikCZHLL-4d8TSn3H1zmKpVoV-UdOA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all, I have a question about how to store URLs for posts.

I'm making a plugin which manages audio files attached to sermons, basically
just files attached to a custom post type.

The plugin which I am replacing (an outdated and abandoned plugin)
essentially creates it's own set of database tables, essentially mirroring
the WP database structure. It has an option to link external URLs to a
sermon, and in the templating it then uses a single function to display any
file, either internal or external. Because of this, the person making the
template can just use something like "show_files()", and it will show files,
whether they are on the server or external URLs. (It actually uses
shortcodes, and some internal templating things.)

I am trying to recreate a similar approach, using built-in WordPress
functions, so that the designer can use things like has_post_thumbnail, and
so on.

Of course, I can attach files normally and store URLs in the post meta, but
then a template theme would need to do something like if( has_files() ||
has_whatever_postmeta(); My goal is to make the URL somehow seamlessly the
same as normally attached files, so far as themes are concerned.

Any input/critique on this problem would be helpful, but I did wonder if I
could just add the "files" into the database, manually if required, and set
the guid to the external link? Are there any dangers/problems to this
approach?

Thanks for any thoughts/critiques,

-----Tobias

Hi all :)

I don't know if this is the right place to announce this, but I could 
not think of a better one.

I'm the developer of "File Gallery" 
<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/file-gallery/>, a plugin designed 
to make handling of media files easier, with support for custom gallery 
templates, custom attachment order, attachment tagging, attachment 
copies and much, much more.

My free time has become very limited in the past year and I'd like to 
find someone who would be willing to take over the development of the 
plugin.

If anyone is interested, please reply to me off list so we can discuss 
it further.

Thanks for reading this!


sincerely,
Bruno "Aesqe" Babic

There is no support for capability filtering with the add_meta_box()
function.

I'm pretty sure that just not registering the metabox when the logged-in
user shouldn't have access will work decently. In whatever function you are
using to register the metabox add a current_user_can('CAP_TO_CHECK') and if
it is false exit the function before doing the metabox registration.

Thanks guys, to solve the problem I copied the permissions of the role
native 'editor', because I know that this was the permissions that I wanted,
 went after eliminating what he wanted to withdraw my new group and submitted
with the following parameters:

add_role('editorImprensa', 'Editor Imprensa', array(

What he said!, And remember to check the capability upon processing the save

Subject: [wp-hackers] custom post types and child pages
Message-ID: <BANLkTikcBrcttHs_pMe6+YrTuasHY-+Wcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've got a couple of questions about Custom Post Types which have come
up in the client project I'm working on. For now I'm suggesting they
just re-arrange the IA to avoid these issues, because I'm not sure
what they're after is possible. However, I'm curious whether anyone
thinks there are possibilities worth exploring.

They're both to do with child pages, one relating to CPT archives and
one relating to CPT single post views.

CPT ARCHIVES

Say I have "projects" as a CPT. The archive page is defined as living here:

/research/projects/

Now, this is also an actual WP page, which I use to manage the intro
to the archive list etc. The URL for a project will of course be:

/research/projects/project-x/

But what if they have some other information about projects and they
want a standard WP page here:

/research/projects/info/

This gives a 404 - presumably because the rewrite rules signal that
we're looking for a project and there's no project with the slug
"info".

For now I've advised that they make anything planned as a child page
of /research/projects/ into a sibling page - not too much of a
sacrifice, and very easy. However, I wonder if there's a way to step
into the rewriting process and say, "If there's no CPTs found under a
CPT archive URL, look for child pages of the page that has the same
URL as the CPT archive"? If anyone's achieved this, do let me know.

CPT SINGLE POST VIEWS

The other issue is that the ideal situation for this project is to
have child pages of CPTs. So if there's a project at this URL:

/research/projects/project-x/

As well as the main page, there might be an extra page for this project:

/research/projects/project-x/extra/

Or more... The whole idea doesn't make sense to me in WP terms - that
child couldn't be a page with a CPT as a parent.

I've tried making the CPT hierarchical, but it doesn't seem to make
sense to have a project as a child of a project for what I'm talking
about above. Besides, the child page throws a 404 :-\

Anyway, anyone wrestled with this stuff before?

cheers,

Steve Taylor

I have the same situation. What I done was to add a filter to the
rewrite rules array and add a couple of rewrite rules that match the
page slugs [1]. It doesn't automatically work for all pages, but as
it's a project for a client  know there will only ever be those two
child pages. If we end up adding other pages then I'll just add their
slugs to the array and regenerate the rewrite rules.

It would be neat to come up with an automated solution. It could
probably be done fairly easily (I'm thinking along the lines of
fetching all child pages of page 'foo' and adding them to the rewrite
rules array and flushing the rules when new pages are added).

For some reason hierarchical CPTs don't get hierarchical URLs. This
has always been the case and I'm not sure why.

At first thought allowing inter-mixing of CPTs and pages doesn't make
a whole lot of sense, but I can see a need for it. I remember back in
the old days (when rewrite rules were in .htaccess) we had a separate
rewrite rule for every page on the site. I'm not for a moment
suggesting we go back to that by defauly, but it would offer a
solution for those who needed it.

You can achieve this with the Role Scoper plugin:
